SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising its regulations governing use of temporary appointments (i.e.,
appointments limited to 1 year or less) to set a uniform service limit for such appointments in both the competitive
and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension (24 months total service). This change is intended
to ensure that temporary appointments, under which employees receive no benefits, are used to meet truly short-term
needs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4601), OPM published proposed regulations to reduce the time limit for temporary appointments,
curtail use of temporary hiring for extended seasonal work, and prohibit successive temporary appointments to the
same or successor jobs. We developed those regulations in response to Congressional and employee concerns and evidence
that some employees were, indeed, serving for years under a succession of temporary appointments with no benefits
and no job security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generated numerous comments from agencies, individual managers and employees, and local
employee organizations. Many of the commenters took opposite positions. Many anticipated changes that will be proposed
in legislation implementing the recommendations of the National Performance Review (NPR). We could not adopt all
of their suggestions, which are summarized below. We have, however, attempted to balance their various concerns
and to provide reasonable operating flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship to NPR
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters felt that the proposal did not go far enough. They stated that the issue of benefits for temporary
employees should be addressed directly by affording benefits and within-grade increases to temporary employees,
that long-term temporaries who have demonstrated their abilities on the job should not have to compete with the public
for permanent vacancies, and that agencies should be able to set the length of temporary appointments based on mission
needs, not arbitrary regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM supports all of those goals. These regulations are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
intended to be the final solution to all of the problems of temporary employment. Rather, they are an interim measure
to address those issues within our control pending more comprehensive reform. We expect that legislation implementing
the human resource recommendations of the NPR will be proposed within the next few months. Until such legislation
is passed, however, OPM has no authority to establish those provisions by regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We expect that the forthcoming legislative proposal would also allow agencies to determine the maximum duration
of temporary appointments, subject to collective bargaining or consensus building procedures. In the meantime,
however, we believe that stricter service limits are needed to ensure that employees who serve for extended periods
are not denied benefits because of their temporary status. We note that the report of the National Performance Review
recommended that temporary employees should serve no more than 2 years (24 months) without benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effect on Current Employees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters feared that tightening limits on temporary service could hurt, not help, employees, especially
those who have limited skills, whose conversion to permanent or term appointments would be blocked by candidates
on an agency's reemployment list, or who work in locations where there are few employment opportunities. We share
this concern. We recognize that some employees may be terminated under the new limits. On balance, however, we believe
that a greater number would be hurt if we withdrew these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees serving under temporary appointments_even those who have been reappointed or extended many times_have
no guarantee of continued employment. Contacts with agencies and employees indicate that some installations are
not renewing temporary appointments as readily as in the past because of reduced funding. Installations facing severe
budget cuts or downsizing are likely to reduce their temporary workforce even without changes in regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In installations that do not face such severe difficulties, use of term appointments, which afford benefits, to fill
longer-lasting nonpermanent jobs would provide more stability for both the agency and the employees. Some agencies
expressed concern about losing their investment in training if employees had to be terminated after 2 years (24 months
total service). Use of term appointments should reduce turnover and its attendant recruiting and training costs,
partially offsetting the cost of providing benefits for the employees.

Converting Current Employees to Term Appointments Outside the Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To facilitate transition from temporary to term appointments, agencies are authorized to give their current competitive
service temporary employees term appointments outside the register in accordance with the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Duration of Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This authority is effective 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
immediately upon publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of these regulations and will remain in effect for 6 months. (Please note that this is different from the effective
date of the regulations.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This authority applies to any employee who is serving in the agency under a temporary appointment in the competitive
service on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
date and whose service is needed for more than 1 additional year. Several agencies expressed concern that some positions
now filled by temporary appointments would not meet the conditions for term appointment. As long as the positions
will last for more than 1 year, that is not true. OPM's current instructions permit term appointments to be used in the
same situations as temporary appointments. The only difference is the service limit. (Those instructions, provisionally
retained in the Federal Personnel Manual Sunset Document, will be incorporated in 5 CFR part 316 in a separate regulation
implementing FPM sunset.)

Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appointments under this authority are subject to the procedures set out in 5 CFR part 333, except for the public notice
requirement in &sect;333.102. (Public notice is required by law only when jobs will be filled from outside the Federal
Government.) An agency that will not convert all eligible temporaries holding identical jobs in the same location
must apply veterans' preference in accordance with part 333 in selecting the employees to receive term appointment.

Position to Which Converted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employees converted under this authority must be given term appointments to positions in the same series, grade,
and location as their temporary positions. Thereafter, they may be reassigned or promoted to other term positions
in accordance with their agency's merit promotion policies. The appointments may be made for any period of more than
1 but no more than 4 years, depending on the agency's need for the employee's services.

Impact of Downsizing and Need for Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern that imposing more restrictive limits now could inhibit agencies' ability
to deal with significant budget reductions and downsizing. They suggested either that authority to extend temporary
appointments beyond 2 years be delegated to agencies or that OPM consider mission needs and downsizing when acting
on extension requests. One commenter also asked whether agencies would have to request each extension separately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations, OPM may approve extensions beyond 2 years (24 months total service) in response to major reorganization,
downsizing, or other unusual circumstances. While normal workload fluctuations would not meet this condition,
an unusual degree of fluctuation resulting from governmentwide staffing changes and resource reductions may justify
extensions. We will entertain requests on that basis and consider each agency's situation on its merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests based on agencywide restructuring downsizing would be submitted by the agency's headquarters, specifying
the conditions, locations, and timeframe for the extensions. OPM approval would cover all extensions meeting the
agreed upon conditions during the authorized time period so there would be no need for individual requests. Agencies
would submit individual extension requests to the appropriate OPM service center to meet one-time needs (e.g., to
complete construction work delayed by unusually severe weather).

Tracking and Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several agencies stated that their personnel record systems might not provide specific information needed to administer
the new requirements (particularly the prohibition against making a new temporary appointment to a position that
had been filled by temporary appointment for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, of the preceding 3 years). They stated
that their systems may not clearly identify ``same or successor'' positions as defined in the regulations. One agency
suggested that the supervisory certification required by the regulations be accepted as documentation that time
limits are met. Another agency suggested dropping the certification requirement in line with the NPR recommendation
to reduce unproductive paperwork. Some agencies asked how the limits would apply when an agency has several identical
jobs in the same commuting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have adopted the suggestion to use the supervisory certification to document compliance with time limits. This
suggestion is consistent with the NPR recommendation to make managers and supervisors accountable for personnel
actions. It is also practical a personnel officer or higher level official may not have enough information to determine
compliance. The supervisor or manager filling a job knows, or should know, whether it has previously been filled temporarily
and whether its duties are substantially the same as a previous temporary position. The supervisory certification
is not unproductive paperwork, but is an alternative to more burdensome tracking requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the regulations the time limits apply to positions within the same local commuting area and major subdivision
of the agency. We believe each agency can and should identify its own major subdivisions. Often, we expect that these
will coincide with the competitive areas established by the agency for RIF. However, in applying these regulations,
an agency may use any objective criteria that clearly distinguish separate functional areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an agency has identical positions within a major subdivision and commuting area, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
successive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
temporary appointments to those positions would be subject to the 2-year (24 month) aggregate limitation. However,
the limit would be calculated separately for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
simultaneous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
temporary appointments to the positions. The difference is that recurring needs could potentially be met through
permanent or term appointments with a less-than-full-time work schedule. Purely temporary needs_regardless of
the number of jobs involved_could not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seasonal Positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to permit unlimited extensions of temporary appointments to jobs involving less than 6 months (1,040
hours) of seasonal or intermittent work a year raised some practical concerns among managers and employees in agencies
with substantial seasonal or intermittent hiring. They believe that managers should not be forced to terminate experienced
employees who work more than 6 months in a season to meet emergency or uncontrollable workload demands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When employees are regularly needed for 6 months or more in a year, the seasonal jobs are not truly temporary and should
be filled by term or permanent appointments. However, we agree that flexibility is needed when an employee who normally
works less than 6 months a year exceeds the limit in a single season. Therefore, the final regulations provide that
OPM may approve exceptions to the 6-month limit. We expect that most such exceptions will be requested on a case-by-case
basis from the appropriate OPM service center. However, we would consider requests to use an alternative method of
calculation (e.g., averaging service over several seasons) if an agency demonstrates that its system and its tracking
capacity will produce long-term compliance with the regulation. Requests for approval of alternate methods should
be submitted through the agency's headquarters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some comments also noted the need to train employees for seasonal work during the off-season. To accommodate this
need, the regulations provide an exception to the 6-month limit for up to 120 days of training following initial appointment
and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not adopt suggestions to exclude all excepted appointments from the regulatory time limits. The conditions
justifying exception from competitive hiring procedures do not always dictate that appointments be limited to 1
year. In fact, the situation most commonly cited as requiring employment longer than 2 years (24 months) was for research
projects. Most excepted authorities covering research positions provide for appointments in increments longer
than 1 year. Such appointments are not covered by these regulations.

Continuing Authority for Appointments Outside the Competitive Examining Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As several commenters noted, the authority to make temporary appointments for most positions using applicant supply
file procedures is currently set out only in Chapter 316 of the Federal Personnel Manual. That chapter will be terminated
on December 31, 1994, as part of FPM sunset. We are incorporating the authority in the revised regulations. We are also
adopting an agency's suggestion to remove all grade level limitations. (The current authority does not apply to positions
at GS&hyph;13 through GS&hyph;15.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not adopt suggestions to authorize term appointments outside the register or to permit temporary appointments
to be converted to term appointments without further competition whenever the need for an employee's services exceeds
original expectations. These suggestions are outside the scope of our regulatory proposal. OPM service centers
may, however, continue to authorize term appointments outside registers when there are insufficient eligibles
on an appropriate register. Agencies that have delegated examining authority may also elect to fill temporary and/or
term positions through those registers. If the same register is used for both temporary and term appointments, applicants
who would have been within reach for term appointments may be converted without further competition. We have clarified
this provision in the regulations. This provision will not apply when positions are publicized and applications
are solicited solely for temporary appointment.

Reemployed Annuitants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have not incorporated in the regulations the authority, now contained in provisionally retained FPM Chapter 316,
for unlimited extensions of temporary employment of reemployed annuitants. That authority is no longer needed.
When the FPM provision was established, certain annuitants (e.g., those over age 70) could be employed only on a temporary
basis. That is no longer true. Annuitants may now be employed under any type of authority_permanent, term, or temporary_that
is appropriate for the job being filled. However, under 5 U.S.C. 3323, reemployed annuitants serve at the will of the
agency. Therefore, agencies need not designate their appointments as temporary in order to retain flexibility.

authority, an agency may make Schedule A, B, or C appointments on either a permanent or nonpermanent basis, with any
appropriate work schedule (i.e., full-time, part-time, seasonal, on-call, or intermittent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When OPM establishes eligibility requirements (e.g., residence, family income) for appointment under particular
Schedule A or B exceptions, an individual's eligibility for appointment must be determined before appointment and
without regard to any conditions that will result from the appointment.

&sect;213.104
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Special provisions for temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, or C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When OPM specifies that appointments under a particular Schedule A, B, or C authority must be temporary, intermittent,
or seasonal, or when agencies elect to make temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, or
C, those terms have the following meanings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Temporary appointments,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unless otherwise specified in a particular Schedule A, B, or C exception, are made for a specified period not to exceed
1 year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermittent positions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are positions in which work recurs at sporadic or irregular intervals so that an employee's tour of duty cannot be scheduled
in advance of the administrative workweek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seasonal positions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 involve annually recurring periods of employment lasting less than 12 months each year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Temporary appointments, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, are subject to the following limits:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Agencies may make temporary appointments for a period not to exceed 1 year, unless the applicable Schedule A, B, or
C authority specifies a shorter period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, agencies may extend
temporary appointments for no more than 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor
position (i.e., a position that replaces and absorbs the original position) is considered to be an extension of the
original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties, in the same major subdivision of
the agency, and in the same local commuting area is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary appointments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an agency may not fill any position (or its successor) by a temporary
appointment in Schedule A, B, or C if that position had previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either
the competitive or excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period.
This limitation does not apply to programs established to provide for systematic exchange between a Federal agency
and nonfederal organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions to the general limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The service limits and restrictions on refilling positions set out in this section do not apply when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment in the same or a successor position under one
or more appointing authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The
service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should
employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the general limits
set out in this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception
under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and
up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Positions are filled under an authority established for the purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or
enhance their education, or to meet academic or professional qualification requirements. Such authorities include
those set out in paragraphs (p), (q), (v), (w), and (jj) of section 213.3102 of this part and authorities granted to
individual agencies for use in connection with internship, fellowship, residency, or student programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) OPM approves extension of specific temporary appointments beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated
by major reorganizations or base closings or other rare and unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization,
base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at
the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position
or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service
center.

 We are amending the list of generally infested areas under the gypsy moth quarantine and regulations by removing and
adding areas in Ohio and Virginia. These changes affect 7 areas in Ohio and 5 areas in Virginia. These actions are necessary
in order to impose certain restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles to prevent the artificial
spread of gypsy moth and delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The gypsy moth, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lymantria dispar
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Linnaeus), is a destructive pest of forest trees. The gypsy moth regulations (contained in 7 CFR 301.45 through 301.45&hyph;12,
and referred to below as the regulations), quarantine certain States because of the gypsy moth, and restrict the interstate
movement of certain articles from generally infested areas in the quarantined States to prevent the artificial spread
of the gypsy moth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;301.45&hyph;2 of the regulations, generally infested areas are, with certain exceptions,
those areas in which a gypsy moth general infestation has been found by an inspector, or each portion of a State which
the Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to infestation or its inseparability for
quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. Less than an entire State will be designated as a generally
infested area only if: (1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions
on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with
respect to the interstate movement of such articles; and, (2) the designation of less than the entire State as a generally
infested area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of infestations of the gypsy moth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Designation of Areas as Generally Infested Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are amending &sect;301.45&hyph;3(a) of the regulations, which lists generally infested areas, by adding Carroll,
Cuyahoga, Jefferson, Lucas, Portage, Stark, and Summit Counties in Ohio, and Bath, Greensville and Highland Counties
and the city of Emporia in Virginia to the list of generally infested areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are taking this action because surveys conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) resulted
in the detection of all life stages of the gypsy moth and the determination that reproducing populations do exist at
significant levels in these areas. Eradication of these populations is not considered feasible because these areas
are immediately adjacent to areas currently recognized to be generally infested and therefore subject to continued
reinfestation.

Removal of Areas From List of Generally Infested Areas

We are also amending &sect;301.45&hyph;3(a) by removing Franklin County in Virginia from the list of generally infested
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are taking this action because Franklin County was previously listed in error. There is no basis for listing this
area as a generally infested area. This action removes unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated
articles from this area. A map designating the regulated areas is as follows:

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
because of the possibility that the gypsy moth could be spread artificially to noninfested areas of the United States,
where it could cause economic loss due to defoliation of susceptible forest areas. Also, where gypsy moth no longer
occurs, immediate action is needed to delete unnecessary restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles and outdoor household articles from and through
gypsy moth regulated areas in Ohio and Virginia. There are several types of restrictions that will apply to the newly-listed
areas in these States. These restrictions will have their primary impact on persons moving households, nursery stock,
logs and wood chips, and mobile homes out of a generally infested area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual and commercial movers moving outdoor household articles (OHA) to areas outside the generally infested
area must attach to the articles either a certificate issued by an inspector, or an OHA document issued by the owner
of the articles. Most individual homeowners moving their own articles who comply with the regulations choose to self-inspect
and issue an OHA document. This takes a few minutes and involves no monetary cost. Individuals may also have State certified
pesticide applicators, trained by the State or USDA, inspect and issue certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons moving regulated articles from a generally infested area (significant examples include logs, pulpwood
and wood chips; mobile homes; and nursery stock) must obtain a certificate or limited permit to move the articles.
There is one exception to this requirement, for logs, pulpwood and wood chips. This exception allows the person moving
such articles to self-certify on the waybill that he or she has inspected the articles. This exception minimizes costs
with regard to logs, pulpwood, and wood chips. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons moving mobile homes and nursery stock must obtain a certificate or limited permit. They may obtain one from
an inspector, or a qualified certified applicator. Inspectors will issue these documents at no charge, but costs
may result from delaying the movement of commercial articles while waiting for the inspection. Documents self-issued
under a compliance agreement avoid this delay costs, but result in costs associated with salary and recordkeeping
for the self-inspections.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When inspection of regulated articles or outdoor household articles reveals gypsy moth, treatment is often necessary.
Treatment is done by qualified certified applicators, which are private businesses that charge, on the average,
$50 to $100 to treat a shipment of articles. Most qualified certified applicators are small businesses. By declaring
an area as a generally infested area, the regulations may increase business for the qualified certified applicator
located in generally infested areas. It is estimated that these businesses will average $50 to $150 per month in additional
income per business. Since the seven counties in Ohio to be regulated contain the metropolitan areas of Akron, Cleveland,
and Toledo, we expect that several hundred shipments containing outdoor household articles will require inspection
to move out of the generally infested area. We anticipate training up to 24 qualified certified applicators to perform
these inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of direct costs from this rule would be incurred by establishments moving trees or shrubs with roots,
such as nurseries. We estimate that approximately 130 such establishments move approximately 1,050 shipments of
trees and shrubs each year to areas outside the generally infested areas. All of these establishments are believed
to be small entities. These establishments would need to be inspected, either by an inspector or through self-inspection
under a compliance agreement. If the inspection reveals signs of gypsy moth, the establishment would have to be treated
in order to ship regulated articles outside the generally infested area. We estimate that annually, approximately
10 percent of these establishments (13 establishments) will be required to treat the establishment, and that the
average area to be treated will be 17 acres. At an average treatment cost of $10 per acre, the average total annual cost
to each establishment would be $170. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Christmas tree industry would also be impacted by this rule change, since Christmas trees moved interstate from
generally infested areas to areas not generally infested would have to be moved under a certificate or permit. We estimate
that there are about 5 Christmas tree producers in the generally infested areas who ship approximately 100 trees each
year to nonregulated areas. All of these establishments are believed to be small entities. Services of an inspector
will be available without charge to inspect the premises and issue certificates and permits. We estimate that 10 percent
of these premises will be found to contain gypsy moth, and will require treatment in order to ship trees. The average
area to be treated is estimated to be 80 acres, and treatment costs are estimated to average $10 per acre. Therefore,
we estimate that the total annual treatment costs for one Christmas tree producer would be approximately $800. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that, in most cases, Christmas tree growers would meet the requirements for certification by having
inspectors determine that the plantations where the trees are grown are free from gypsy moth. This alternative would
be less costly than inspecting or treating individual shipments of trees and would minimize the economic impact of
the change to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule finalizes without change two interim final rules which revised the handling requirements for California
nectarines and peaches by expanding the regulatory periods and by modifying the grade, maturity, size, container,
and pack requirements for fresh shipments of these fruits, beginning with 1994 season shipments. This finalization
will enable handlers to continue shipping fresh nectarines and peaches meeting consumer needs in the interest of
producers, handlers, and consumers of these fruits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order Nos. 916 and 917 [7 CFR Parts 916 and 917] regulating
the handling of nectarines and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the orders. The orders are
effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act.

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA
is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines
and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000.

The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended revision of the handling requirements for California
nectarines, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended revision of the handling requirements for California
peaches. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous
basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the public, and
interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations
and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or
termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes two interim final rules that revised the handling requirements for nectarines in &sect;916.350
California Nectarine Container and Pack Regulation [7 CFR 916.350], and in &sect;916.365 California Nectarine
Grade and Size Regulation [7 CFR 916.365], and for peaches in &sect;917.442 California Peach Container and Pack Regulation
[7 CFR 917.442] and in &sect;917.459 California Peach Grade and Size Regulation [7 CFR 917.459]. The first interim
final rule was issued on March 29, 1994, and published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 15835, April 5, 1994], and the second interim final rule was issued on June 9, 1994, and published in the

 [59 FR 31118, June 17, 1994]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending May 5, 1994, and two comments were received. The
first comment received was from John Kovacevich, Jr., a California peach grower and shipper, requesting a change
in the peach grade requirements to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. The change
requested by this commentor was included in the first interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment received was from Harold McClarty of The HMC Group of Kingsburg, California, supporting the weight-count
revisions made in the handling requirements for fresh nectarines and peaches by the first interim final rule, since
such revisions will be beneficial when they packed fruit in volume-filled containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending July 18, 1994, and one comment was received.
The comment was received from Gary W. Van Sickle, Field Director for the PCC and the NAC, reaffirming the PCC's and the
NAC's support of the revised pack requirements contained in the second interim final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first interim final rule amended paragraph (a) in &sect;916.350 and paragraph (a) in &sect;916.356 to change
the regulatory periods in each of these sections to April 1 through October 31 each year, so that all nectarine shipments
made each season are covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (a)(7) of &sect;916.356
was revised to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers
ship fresh nectarines during the April 1&hyph;April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The NAC unanimously
recommended this change. Prior to amendment, &sect;&sect;916.350 and 916.356 were effective for the period April
15 through October 31 each year.

Container and Pack Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.350 specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;916.350 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of nectarines in
a 16-pound sample for each tray-pack size designation. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;916.350 by modifying Table I to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season nectarine
varieties, and by adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these revised container marking requirements for nectarines after a comprehensive review of
the appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled
containers for all nectarine varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different
varieties of fruit during the course of the season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also revised &sect;916.350 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises
&sect;916.356 by redesignating current paragraph (b) as (c) and adding a new paragraph (b) to that section. These
revisions specify the procedure to be used in determining whether nectarines meet the minimum size requirements
specified for each size category in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirements. Under this procedure,
a sample consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category
shall be used, provided such sample weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample
results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight.
If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample
must be used to determine if the fruit meets minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of nectarines could be adequately
determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce
inspection time and inspection costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim final rule further revised &sect;916.350 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying
that the nectarines in any volume-filled container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container.
The second interim final rule also removed the proviso in paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;916.350 reading ``That nectarines
in any container shall be fairly uniform in size'', because such requirements are included within the definition
of ``standard pack'' in the United States Standards for Grades of Nectarines, and therefore are not needed in this
paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh nectarines in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive
review of changes in the nectarine industry packing practices over the years, and the need to make appropriate changes
in the pack requirements to reduce bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs. The revision provided handlers
with more flexibility in packing their nectarines and selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled
packs to help prevent fruit bruising.

Maturity Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies maturity guides for fresh nectarines in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table I of &sect;916.356 for nectarines. The first interim final rule revised
Table I of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of &sect;916.356 for nectarines to add maturity guides for 18 nectarine varieties
and to change the maturity guide for two nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these maturity guide changes for these nectarine varieties based on a continuing review of their
individual maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the
``well matured'' level of maturity for such varieties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies size requirements for fresh nectarines in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9). The first
interim final rule revised &sect;916.356 to establish variety-specific size requirements for seven nectarine
varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages for the first time
during the 1993 season. Paragraph (a)(3) was revised to include the May Kist variety; and paragraph (a)(6) of &sect;916.356
was revised to include the Arctic Rose, Del Rio Rey, Kay Diamond, Late Red Jim, Prima Diamond, and Red Glen varieties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also revised &sect;916.356 to remove five nectarine varieties from the variety-specific
size requirements specified in the section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced
during the 1993 season. Paragraph (a)(4) of that section was revised to remove the Apache and Early May Grande nectarine
varieties; and paragraph (a)(6) was revised to remove the Nectarine 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4, Tasty Free, and 9&hyph;86&hyph;04&hyph;87 nectarine varieties. The nectarine varieties removed from the nectarine
variety-specific list became subject to the non-listed variety size requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(7),
(a)(8), and (a)(9) of &sect;916.356. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also lowered the minimum size requirement for the Zee Grand variety by permitting as many
as 88 nectarines to be packed in a lug box rather than 84 nectarines, and as many as 83 nectarines when packed otherwise
rather than 75 nectarines. This was accomplished by reassigning that variety to paragraph (a)(4) from paragraph
(a)(5) in &sect;916.356. The NAC recommended this change based on a more accurate evaluation of this variety's sizing
and maturity characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;916.356, paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (a)(9)(i) were revised to permit as many as 84 nectarines to
be packed in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) and (a)(9)(ii) were
revised to permit as many as 75 nectarines in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit late-season
nectarine varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the
higher ``well matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit,
because it will assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market
in the interest of growers, handlers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of nectarines
packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for nectarines specified in paragraphs
(a)(2)(ii), (a)(3)(ii), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(5)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), and (a)(8)(ii). These size changes correspond to
the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and
Table 2 for late-season nectarine varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these nectarine varieties, and consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first
interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh nectarines consistent with expected
crop and market conditions.

Container and Pack Requirements (Peaches) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.442 currently specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;917.442 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound
sample for each tray pack size designation. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;917.442 by modifying Table I to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season peach varieties,
and by adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season peach varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (d) as (e) and by adding a new paragraph (d) to that section. These
revisions specify the procedure to be used in determining whether peaches meet the minimum size requirements specified
for each size category in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirement. Under this procedure a sample
consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall
be used, provided such sample weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results
in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If
a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must
be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of peaches could be adequately

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second interim final rule further revised &sect;917.442 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying
that the peaches in any volume-filled container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container. The
PCC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh peaches in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive

Grade Requirements (Peaches) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.459 specifies grade requirements for peaches in paragraph (a)(1), requiring peaches shipped fresh
to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.459
to provide an additional 25 percent tolerance for fruit damaged by open sutures, but not seriously damaged, in addition
to the 10 percent general lot tolerance currently permitted under the U.S. No. 1 grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this change to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. Open sutures
are not considered to be a serious grade defect since they affect only the appearance of the fruit. The open suture condition
occurs infrequently in peaches and is most likely due to unusual weather and climatic conditions. However, this condition
can cause considerable economic loss to growers when it does occur, because it sometimes affects a large portion of
their crop.

Section 917.459 specifies maturity guides for fresh peaches in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table I of &sect;917.459 for peaches. The first interim final rule revised Table
I of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of &sect;917.459 for peaches to add maturity guides for 19 peach varieties and to change the
maturity guide for one peach variety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these maturity guide changes for these peach varieties based on a continuing review of their individual

Size Requirements (Peaches) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.459 specifies size requirements for fresh peaches in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6), and paragraphs
(b) and (c). The first interim final rule revised &sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (a)(6) as paragraph
(a)(3) and current paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) as paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively,
so that the size regulations are in sequential order. The first interim final rule also revised &sect;917.459 to establish
variety-specific size requirements for five peach varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities
of more than 10,000 packages for the first time during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5)
was revised to include the Crimson Lady and Rich May peach varieties; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) was revised
to include the Fancy Lady, Snow Ball, and Sugar Lady peach varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also revised &sect;917.459 to remove four peach varieties from the variety-specific
size requirements specified in that section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced
during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;917.459 was revised to remove the
Flavor Red peach variety; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) was revised to remove the July Lady, Red Cal, and Redglobe
peach varieties. The peach varieties removed from the variety-specific list became subject to the non-listed variety
size requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;917.459. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first interim final rule also amended &sect;917.459 by revising paragraph (b) to change the ending date of the
regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to June 30 from July 2, and
paragraph (c) to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred
to in that paragraph to July 1 from July 3. These changes reflect the sizing characteristics of such peach varieties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(i) was revised to permit as many as 80 peaches to packed
in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(iii) was revised to permit
as many as 73 peaches in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit certain late-season peach
varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well
matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will
assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest
of growers, handlers, and consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches
packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs
(a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii), and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column
2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited
in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first
interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected
crop and market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised handling requirements
for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have
a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes the revised handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with
expected crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will
continue to meet acceptable handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help
the California nectarine and peach industries continue to provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed
to maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule changing the rules and regulations under the cranberry marketing order. The marketing order regulates
the handling of cranberries grown in 10 States and is administered locally by the Cranberry Marketing Committee (Committee).
This rule revises or deletes language in the order's rules and regulations to reflect amendatory changes to the marketing
order completed in 1992. This rule makes the order's rules and regulations consistent with the current marketing
order language.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 [7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling
of cranberries grown in 10 States, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries who are subject to regulation under the order and approximately
1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small
Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural
producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of cranberries may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule finalizes revisions or deletions to the language in the order's rules and regulations to reflect amendatory
changes to the order completed in 1992. This rule makes the order's rules and regulations consistent with current
order language. These changes were unanimously recommended by the Cranberry Marketing Committee (Committee) at
its March 1, 1994, meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on July 11, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 36021, July 15, 1994], with an effective date of July 15, 1994. That rule amended &sect;&sect;929.107, 929.108,
929.110, 929.148, 929.150, and 929.153 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided
a 30-day comment period which ended August 15, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the cranberry marketing order was amended [57 FR 38748, August 27, 1992] to change, among other provisions,
the volume control features of the order. Prior to the amendment, the order authorized a base quantity program in which
each producer received a base quantity calculated by the Committee from a representative period in the order. Base
quantity was annually distributed to existing producers and new producers based on a formula in the order. The 1992
order amendments authorized a volume control program to be based on the sales history of each producer. The Committee
now calculates a sales history for each producer based on the average of sales for a specified period for each producer
or, in the case of a new producer, sales history is based on a State's average yield per acre. Other order amendments
were made to reflect current industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first change revises section 929.107 which currently provides the basis for determining established cranberry
acreage. The section is revised by deleting various terms, dates, and section references. The term ``established''
cranberry acreage and the reference to section 929.16 are no longer applicable since they were removed by the 1992
amendment. The reference to growing cranberries during a specified period of time (i.e., 1965&hyph;66 through 1967&hyph;68)
and other similar date references are removed since producers are no longer required to produce during this period
to have a commercial crop of cranberries. Other modifications are made in the section for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second change deletes section 929.108 which provides for procedures to substantiate a firm and substantial commitment
for use in determining base quantities. This section is no longer applicable since the order amendments authorize
a sales history to be computed for every producer. New or existing producers no longer have to show a firm and substantial
commitment to receive base quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third change revises section 929.110 which provides for transfers or sales of cranberry acreage during the representative
period. This section is revised by deleting the term ``representative period.'' This term is no longer applicable
since all reference to a representative period for computing base quantities was removed by the 1992 amendment. Producers
must inform the Committee at any time when transfers or sales of acreage are made. Also, the term ``base quantity''
is deleted and replaced with the term ``sales history.'' Other minor changes are made to the section to make it consistent
with the order amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth change deletes section 929.148 which provides factors to be considered when assigning or adjusting base
quantities for producers. This section is no longer applicable since the order amendment authorizes the computation
of a sales history for each producer. These factors are not used when calculating sales history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth change revises section 929.150(a) which provides for the transfer or assignment of base quantities. This
section is revised by deleting the term ``base quantity'' and replacing it with the term ``sales history.'' The term
base quantity is no longer applicable since the order amendment authorizes a sales history to be calculated for each
producer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last change deletes section 929.153 which provides for the establishment and distribution of a base quantity
reserve. This section is no longer applicable since the 1992 order amendment provides for a volume control program
to be based on sales histories of producers. A producer's sales history is updated annually based on the highest four
out of six years' sales. Therefore, a base quantity reserve is not necessary for updating producers' sales histories
or for allowing entry of new growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the

 This interim final rule authorizes the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California
olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. This action is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels
and is consistent with current market demand for olives. As required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, this action also changes the import regulation so that it conforms with the requirements established
under the California olive marketing order.

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Order No. 932 [7 CFR Part 932], as amended, regulating the
handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural

This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities, including olives, imported into the United States
that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities regulated under the Federal marketing
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season,
and there are about 1,200 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to
the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms,
which include handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual
receipts of less than $5,000,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority
of olive producers and importers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout
California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. The majority of olives are produced
in central California. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are
eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is
essentially a domestic market. A few shipments of California olives are exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 163,023 tons
during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1993&hyph;94 production
totalled about 120,049 tons. Total production for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is estimated to be 95,000 tons. Because
olive trees need to restore their nutrients from one season to the next, various varieties of olives produced in California
have alternate bearing tendencies. This results in high production one year and low the next, which usually causes
the total crop to vary greatly from year to year. This crop year's estimated production is expected to be smaller than
last year due to weather conditions early in the season which resulted in poor fruit pollination. However, based on
past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during
the 1994&hyph;95 crop year to meet market demand for limited use styles of canned olives. Limited use olives are too
small to meet the minimum size requirements established for whole and whole pitted canned ripe olives. However, they
are large enough to be suitable for processing into limited use styles such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments.
Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have
to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for
whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized
for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in &sect;932.51(a)(3)
and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in &sect;932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended.
The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted
under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by
the Secretary. During the past three crop years, 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94, the committee recommended
sizes smaller than those previously authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the
marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had
to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower
on fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but
two crop years since the order was promulgated in 1965.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market demand for limited use style olives based upon
current conditions. The limited use size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed
of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Permitting the use of such smaller olives for limited use styles would therefore
improve grower returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1994, the committee recommended by a vote of 15&hyph;1, to establish grade and size regulations for limited
use size olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order. The one
handler member who dissented was concerned that approval of limited use size olives would be detrimental to handlers,
due to already large inventories of such olives from the two previous seasons. The recommended grade and size requirements
are the same as those established during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, which means slightly larger minimum sizes than
were in effect during the 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94 crop years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specified sizes for the different olive variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use
in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the
production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced,
and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of
this relaxation in size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee also based its decision on certain production and market factors. The last three crop years were the
first crop years that limited use olives were authorized at sizes below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year minimum size requirements.
Prior to the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, the committee investigated limited use olives that were below permitted minimum
sizes. From investigations and surveys within the industry, the committee determined that limited use olives below
1990&hyph;91 minimum sizes could be efficiently sliced using current technology. However, consumer interest in
and need for such olives also had to be determined, specifically for smaller sliced olive rings. Thus, minimum size
requirements below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year were recommended and became effective for limited use olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the following three seasons, the industry experienced a higher percentage of broken pieces in the smaller
olives than with the slightly larger sizes. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) define
a broken piece as any piece of olive that is less than three quarters of a full unit. This situation had a negative impact
on the California olive market as the extra broken pieces caused customers to complain about the lack of uniformity
and poorer quality of product from these smaller sizes. Such olives also had to compete with imported sliced olives
that had fewer broken pieces. Therefore, the committee recommended slightly larger minimum size requirements for
limited use olives in order to improve the quality of and enhance the market for California limited use olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the committee estimates that production for this crop year is expected to be at 95,000 tons, which is smaller
than the previous two seasons. Weather conditions early in the crop year caused poor pollination resulting in a smaller
crop with an uneven distribution of sizes. The 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 crop years produced large crops of 163,023
tons and 120,049 tons, respectively. During years with large olive crops, the ratio of limited use olives to other
sizes tends to be higher; there are more limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. During years with
small olive crops, the ratio of smaller olives to other sizes is smaller; there tends to be fewer limited use size olives
in proportion to the other sizes. The increased availability of limited use sized fruit could be reflected in handler
processing for the last three seasons. For example, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 19 percent of the olives (163,024
tons) processed by handlers were limited use, and during the 1991&hyph;92 crop year, 11 percent of total olives (63,259
tons) processed by handlers were limited use. Although limited use minimum sizes were larger during the 1990&hyph;91
season, limited use olive processed by handlers were 16 percent of total olives (126,879 tons) purchased by handlers.
Thus, unlike the two previous seasons, fewer small limited use olives are expected to be harvested this season. The
percentage of limited use olives is expected to be smaller. The slight increase in minimum limited use size requirements
being established for the 1994&hyph;95 season is therefore not expected to greatly impact available supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, it is found that permitting limited use olives as recommended by the committee is expected to improve market
conditions, and grower returns, and meet market needs for limited use style olives.

Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives
under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows
smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the
olive import regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet
certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Olive Regulation 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [7 CFR &sect;944.401]. All canned ripe olives are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release
from custody of the United States Custom Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must
be inspected and certified prior to canning. ``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers
and heat sterilized under pressure, of two distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the Standards.
The term does not include Spanish-style green olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported, disposed of, or shipped for exempt uses.
Exportation or disposal of such olives would be accomplished under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch
of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer.
Exempt olives are those imported for processing into oil or donation to charity. Any person may also import up to 100
pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule modifies paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation to authorize the importation of
bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for whole and whole pitted uses
to be used in the production of limited use styles during the 1994&hyph;1995 crop year. This rule also establishes
size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended to authorize establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles
during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various
variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import
regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes for import
requirements are as follows:

Permitting the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take better advantage
of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will be able to import
and market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional
opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply and facilitate market expansion. In the
absence of this action, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited uses, and would have to be disposed of through
less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection service, exported, or utilized in exempt
outlets.

 This final rule modifies the time periods when imported onions are regulated based on the grade, size, quality and
maturity requirements of the South Texas onion and Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion marketing orders. This rule also establishes
import requirements for red variety onions based on South Texas requirements. The changes are needed to make the onion
import requirements consistent with changes to the South Texas onion marketing order, as required by section 8e of
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (Act).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. There are approximately 75 importers of onions who
will be affected by this final rule. Small agricultural service firms, which include onion importers, have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000. The
majority of onion importers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Import regulations issued under the Act are based on regulations established under Federal marketing orders to regulate
domestically produced products. Thus, this final rule has small entity orientation, and impact on both small and
large business entities in a manner comparable to rules issued under marketing orders. This rule modifies the dates
when imported onions, including red variety onions, are regulated based on requirements of the South Texas onion
and Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8e provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including onions, are regulated under a Federal
marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements
as those in effect for the domestically produced commodity. The Act further provides that when two or more marketing
orders covering the same commodity are concurrently in effect, imports will be subject to the requirements established
for the commodity grown in the area with which the imported commodity is in most direct competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing Order No. 958 regulates onions grown in certain counties of Idaho and Eastern Oregon and Marketing Order
No. 959 regulates onions grown in South Texas. Fresh onion shipments from Idaho-Eastern Oregon are regulated throughout
the year, while onion shipments from South Texas were regulated from March 1 through May 20 each year. On the basis of
past shipment data, the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) had determined that onions imported during the March
10 through May 20 period were in most direct competition with onions grown in South Texas and found that the minimum
grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for onions imported during that period should be the same as those
established for South Texas onions under Marketing Order No. 959. The Secretary further determined that onions imported
during the May 21 through March 9 period were in most direct competition with onions grown in Idaho-Eastern Oregon
and that the minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for onions imported during that period should
be the same as those established for Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions under Marketing Order No. 958. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a recommendation of the South Texas Onion Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration
of Marketing Order No. 959, the Department has extended the end of the South Texas regulatory period from May 20 to June
15. The Fruit and Vegetable Division's Market News Service has reported no onion shipments of commercial quantities
from the Idaho-Eastern Oregon production area during June from the 1990 through 1993 period, and only one year during
this period, 1993, were onion shipments recorded during May. Therefore, onions imported during the period March
10 through June 15 are in most direct competition with those produced in South Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, now that the change in the regulatory period for South Texas onions is effective, a corresponding change must
be made in the onion import regulation so that the requirements established under the South Texas marketing order
will be the determining requirements for onions imported during the May 21 through June 15 period. Currently, imports
of onions during that period are required to meet minimum requirements based on those established under the Idaho-Eastern
Oregon marketing order. This rule changes onion import requirements to be the same as the South Texas requirements
during that period. With that adjustment, the onion import requirement will be based on the requirements for South
Texas onions during the period March 10 through June 15, and will be based on the requirements for Idaho-Eastern Oregon
onions during the June 16 through March 9 period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Red onion varieties are subject to minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements under the Idaho-Eastern
Oregon marketing order, but those requirements are not in effect for imported red onions during the South Texas regulatory
period. However, based on a recommendation of the committee, the Department has established minimum requirements
for red onion varieties grown in the South Texas production area. Since South Texas red onion varieties are regulated,
red onions, imported from March 10 to June 15 shall be required to grade at least U.S. No. 1 with a 20 percent defect allowance
and 1 and 3/4 inch minimum diameter. This requirement will be in effect through June 15 as the South Texas regulatory
period has been extended to June 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Notice of this rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 33453]. Interested persons were invited to file written comments with respect to the proposal until July 29,
1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the proposal submitted by the committee, and
other information, it is hereby found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act.

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 146 [7 CFR part 998] regulating the quality of domestically
produced peanuts, hereinafter referred to as the agreement. This agreement is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 75 handlers of peanuts subject to regulation under the agreement, and about 47,000 peanut producers
in the 16 States covered under the program. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. Some of the handlers signatory to the agreement are
small entities, and a majority of the producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds
of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value
is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the agreement, in place since 1965, is to ensure that only wholesome peanuts enter edible market channels.
About 70 percent of U.S. shellers (handlers), handling approximately 95 percent of the crop, have voluntarily signed
the agreement. Under the agreement, farmers' stock peanuts with visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) are required to be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of milled peanuts
must be sampled and the samples chemically analyzed for aflatoxin contamination. Signatory handlers who comply
with these requirements may be eligible for indemnification of losses for individual lots of their peanuts which
test positive to aflatoxin. Indemnification and administrative costs are paid by assessments levied on handlers
signatory to the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee, which is composed of growers and handlers of peanuts, meets to review the rules and regulations effective
on a continuous basis for peanuts regulated under the agreement. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested
persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews Committee recommendations and information,
as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the
rules and regulations will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on March 15 and 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended clarifying changes to &sect;998.100 Incoming
quality regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 998.34 of the agreement provides authority for the modification of the incoming quality regulation by the
Secretary of Agriculture, if the Secretary finds that such modification would tend to effectuate the objectives
of the agreement.

 mold must be stored and shelled separate and apart from other peanuts. The regulation does not specifically state
that Segregation 2 seed peanuts containing up to three percent damaged kernels and no visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mold can be stored and shelled with Segregation 1 seed lots if the seed peanuts were produced under the auspices of a
State agency. The Committee believes that the current provisions authorize such commingling but believe that the
authority should be expressly stated to avoid confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee noted that requiring Segregation 2 seed peanuts to be stored separately from Segregration 1 seed peanuts
would increase the number of storage bins handlers needed to maintain separation. This would increase handler costs.
It also noted that requiring the Segregation 2 seed peanuts to be shelled separate and apart from Segregation 1 seed
peanuts would increase handler shelling costs with no apparent benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Committee recommended adding a sentence to paragraph (e) clarifying that seed peanut lots may be stored
and shelled with Segregation 1 lots if: (1) The seed peanuts do not exceed 3 percent total damage and have no visible

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mold; and (2) both the Segregation 2 seed peanut lot and the Segregation 1 seed peanut lot are produced under the auspices
of a State agency which regulates or controls the production of seed peanuts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also provides that the unchanged portions of the incoming, outgoing, and indemnification regulations
currently in effect under the agreement for 1993 crop peanuts be established for 1994 and subsequent crop peanuts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1994, [59 FR 36353] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. That rule provided that interested
persons could file comments through August 17, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553) because: (1) This action clarifies requirements currently in effect for peanut handlers who are signatory
to the agreement; and (2) the interim final rule provided that interested persons could file comments through August
17, 1994. No comments were received and the Department is adopting a final rule, without change, the provisions of
the interim final rule.

The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) published a final regulation under part 650 on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9622). The
final regulation adds 12 CFR part 650 to require the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to adopt a conflict-of-interest
policy that defines the types of relationships, transactions, or activities that might reasonably be expected to
give rise to a potential conflict of interest. In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 2252, the effective date of the final rule
is 30 days from the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model
206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters. This action requires
initial and repetitive inspections of the swashplate for cracks in the swashplate support assembly fillet radius
area and replacement, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks found in the swashplate support
assembly fillet radius area near the base. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the swashplate
support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI) Model
206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters, equipped with swashplate
support assembly, part number (P/N) 206&hyph;010&hyph;452&hyph;001, &hyph;005, or &hyph;109. BHTI has received
three reports of swashplate support assemblies with cracks in the fillet radius area near the base. The cracks originated
on the aft section of the swashplate support assembly. The total time-in-service (TIS) on each of the reported swashplate
support assemblies exceeded 1,500 hours. The swashplate support assembly is a critical, non-rotating, rotor system
component that supports the rotating swashplate. Through the swashplate support assembly and subsequently the
swashplate, the pilot control movements that are necessary to maintain rotorcraft control are transferred to the
main rotor system. Therefore, a crack in a swashplate support assembly creates an unsafe condition. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system,
and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74,
Revision B, and 206L&hyph;93&hyph;89, Revision B, both dated April 4, 1994, which describe procedures for an initial
visual inspection for cracks within the next 25 hours TIS using a 10-power magnifying glass, and thereafter, repetitive
visual inspections for cracks at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS from the last inspection. The inspections are
for swashplate support assemblies that have more than 1,500 hours TIS. If a crack is suspected, the Alert Service Bulletins
provide for a dye penetrant inspection. If a crack is found, the applicable Alert Service Bulletin specifies replacement
of the swashplate support assembly with an airworthy swashplate support assembly prior to the next flight. Neither
BHTI Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, nor 206L&hyph;93&hyph;89, Revision B, both dated
April 4, 1994, shows the Model 206A&hyph;1 as being an affected model helicopter. However, this model helicopter
uses the same swashplate support assembly as the Model 206A helicopter. Therefore, for purposes of this AD, Alert
Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, dated April 4, 1994, will also apply to the Model 206A&hyph;1
helicopter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. Model 206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters of the
same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of
the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. For swashplate support assemblies that have
1,500 hours or more total TIS, this AD requires an initial visual inspection for cracks using a 10-power or higher magnifying
glass within 25 hours TIS. Also, for swashplate support assemblies with less than 1,500 hours total TIS, this AD requires
an initial visual inspection for cracks using a 10-power or higher magnifying glass prior to attaining 1,525 hours
total TIS. Thereafter, repetitive inspections of the affected swashplate support assemblies are required at intervals
not to exceed 50 hours TIS from the last inspection. If a crack is suspected, a dye penetrant inspection is required.
Replacement of cracked swashplate support assemblies with airworthy swashplate support assemblies is required.
Installation of an airworthy swashplate support assembly, P/N 206&hyph;010&hyph;452&hyph;113, constitutes
a terminating action for the requirements of this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with
the service bulletins described previously. Due to the criticalness of the swashplate support assembly and the short
compliance times, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;22&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action maintains the Class D airspace that was formerly a part of the Lawton, OK, Class D airspace, and establishes
Class E airspace at Fort Sill, OK. Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK, was previously a satellite airport within
the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK. The local aircraft operators requested and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton
Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton,
OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. Controlled airspace from the surface is needed
at Fort Sill on a continuous basis for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Henry Post Army Airfield. Therefore,
during the hours the Fort Sill airport traffic control tower (ATCT) is in operation, Class D airspace will be in effect,
and during hours the ATCT is non-operational, Class E airspace will be in effect. This action is intended to provide
for more flexibility in airspace utilization and to provide control over each individual area of airspace, particularly
during times when the towers are non-operational.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to split the Class
D airspace at Lawton, OK. into Lawton, OK, Class D airspace and Ft. Sill, OK, Class D airspace, and re-designate Lawton,
OK, Class E airspace as Fort Sill, OK, airspace, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (For Lawton, OK. at 58 FR 62057, for Fort Sill, OK. at 58 FR 62054). Prior to this action, Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort
Sill, OK, was a satellite airport within the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK. Local aircraft operators requested
and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one area covering
the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. This
proposed action would provide for more flexibility and control of the airspace from the surface when it is needed at
Fort Sill, OK, for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Henry Post AAF. This action will establish Class D airspace
during hours the airport traffic control tower (ATCT) is operational and Class E airspace during hours the ATCT is
non-operational.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The Notice of proposed rulemaking described
extensions to the Class D airspace 4-mile radius as ``within 1.3 miles each side of the 181
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; bearing from the Trail NDB extending from the 4-mile radius to 6.2 miles north of the Henry Post AAF and within
1.2 miles each side of the 003
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; radial of the Lawton VOR/DME extending from the 4-mile radius to 4.7 miles north of the Henry Post AAF''. If any
extension to a Class D airspace extends beyond 2 miles, all extensions for the Class D airspace area will be classified
as Class E airspace. The airspace extensions as described in the NPRM would have lead to an incorrect classification
of the airspace extensions as Class D airspace instead of Class E airspace. The proposal should not have included the
extensions within the Class D description. Therefore, the narrative description of the Class D airspace has been
corrected to exclude these extensions, and a separate Class E description has been added for this airspace. Other
than these changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The FAA has determined that these changes
will not increase the scope of this rule since they are relieving in nature, i.e., re-designating proposed Class D
airspace to less restrictive Class E airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinate for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in paragraph 5000, Class E extensions to a Class D surface area are published in paragraph 6004, and Class E airspace
designated as a surface area for an airport are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994,
and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes separate Class D and Class
E airspace for Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operational current. If, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton, OK. The current Lawton, OK, Class D airspace encompasses both
the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. The local aircraft operators
requested and the FAA decided to divide the Lawton Class D airspace into two individual areas of Class D airspace; one
area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and the other area covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort
Sill, OK, as well as re-designate the former Lawton Class E airspace as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace. This action
is intended to provide for more flexibility in airspace utilization and provide control over each individual area
of airspace, particularly during times when the towers are non-operational.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace at Lawton, OK, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 62057). A request was made by local aircraft operators to divide the Lawton Class D airspace, Lawton, OK, into
two separate areas of Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering
Henry Post Army Airfield (AAF), Fort Sill, OK. This proposed modification would allow for more flexibility in controlling
each individual area of airspace to the extent deemed necessary, particularly during the times when the towers are
non-operational. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The current Lawton Class D airspace has
Class E extension's to the surface area. When Lawton Municipal Airport and Henry Post AAF were designated as separate
Class D airspace areas, it became necessary to re-designate the Class E extension's to the previous Lawton Class D
airspace area as Class E extension's to the Fort Sill Class D airspace because of their locations. The original proposal
failed to address this situation. Therefore, this action corrects that oversight by revoking the Class E extension's
to the Lawton Class D airspace. The Class E airspace extension's that have been revoked by this action have been re-instated
in the rulemaking action that establishes the Class D airspace for Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill OK. Except for
this change, the amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The FAA has determined that this change will not
increase the scope of this rule because it is relieving, i.e. it revokes previous Class E airspace making it less restrictive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations
are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in
this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace at Lawton,
OK, to separate the Lawton Class D airspace into two separate Class D airspace; one area covering the Lawton Municipal
Airport, Lawton, OK, and one covering Henry Post Army Airfield, Fort Sill, OK. This action also revokes the Class E
extension's to the previous Lawton, OK, Class D airspace so it can be redesignated as Fort Sill, OK, Class E airspace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 11, 1994, the Agency published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 an interim rule with request for comments. The interim rule amended &sect;514.30, which governs the administration
of camp counselor exchanges conducted under the auspices of the Exchange Visitor Program. Specifically, this amendment
permits repeat participation, in excess of two summers, for no more than ten percent of each Agency-designated sponsor's
camp counselor exchange participants for a particular exchange year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite assertions received by the Agency to the contrary, the designation of exchange visitor sponsors and the administration
of the Exchange Visitor Program are deemed to be foreign affairs functions of the Untied States. The Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)(1989) specifically exempts such functions from the requirements of the Act. Nevertheless,
the Agency invited comments from the public on the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received, all of them favorable. One comment from Camp America noted that the ten percent rule
would provide opportunities to the greatest number of participants while minimizing disruption of existing programs.
Another, from the Alliance for International Educational and Cultural Exchange, noted that the interim rule adopted
a ``reasonable compromise'' to the concerns raised by Alliance members and the American Camping Association, although
it noted for the record that camp counselor sponsors did not support the participation limitation for counselors.
The Alliance also expressed a reservation regarding the ability of sponsors to ascertain whether an individual has
previously participated in any other camp counselor programs, and recommended that the rule be modified to require
only that a sponsoring organization be responsible for reporting its own repeat participation rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency is aware that sponsors may not have adequate resources to detect an outright fabrication about
program participation by a prospective counselor, it is nevertheless incumbent upon sponsoring organizations
to use every reasonable means at their disposal to ascertain that counselor's program participation history. This
includes, but is not limited to, informing the counselor of the importance of the participation requirement and explicitly
asking potential counselors about prior participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirement of this regulation has been submitted to and approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Agency certifies
that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is
not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule have Federalism
implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Interim Rule which amended 22 CFR 514.30, published at 59 FR 16983 on April 11, 1994 is adopted as a
Final Rule without change.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to restrict
vessel traffic in the regulated area to prevent an allision with the salvage equipment located mid-channel at mile
43.0, Upper Mississippi River. The regulation restricts general navigation in the regulated area for the safety
of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property along the river.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, recent decreases in the river levels of the Upper Mississippi
River have necessitated the removal and salvage of two sunken barges at miles 43.0 and 42.7 that have been determined
to be a hazard to navigation in that area. As a result, the Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue
a regulation immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The situation requiring this regulation is the reduction of the channel width to 200 feet from below the Thebes Railroad
Bridge at mile 43.7 to mile 42.0 due to the presence of salvage equipment. The salvage equipment is on scene to refloat
two sunken barges at miles 43.0 and 42.7 that have been determined to be a hazard to navigation in that area. The regulation
is intended to restrict all vessels to the following provisions. Meeting, overtaking or passing in the safety zone
is prohibited. Upbound tows transiting the safety zone are limited in size to twenty barges and not more than four wide.
Downbound tows transitting the safety zone are limited in size to fifteen barges and not more than three wide. During
daylight hours, all vessels approaching the safety zone must contact the Coast Guard representative on board the
M/V CAPTAIN VAL on VHF&hyph;FM channels 6, 13 or 16 for passing instructions. Upbound vessels must call in when approaching
mile 39.0 and downbound vessels must call in when approaching mile 58.0. During hours of darkness, all vessels must
use all reasonable means to identify vessels transiting or approaching the safety zone and make safe passing arrangements.
All vessels must transit the safety zone at their slowest safe speed and should expect delays. All vessels are urged
to give the widest possible berth to salvage equipment and operations. All vessels transiting the area are urged to
exercise extreme caution.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). Because the duration of this emergency situation
is anticipated to be short, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full
Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain
of the Port, Paducah, Kentucky will monitor river conditions and will authorize unrestricted entry into the restricted
area as conditions permit. Changes will be announced by Marine Safety Information Radio broadcast (Broadcast Notice
to Mariners) on VHF marine band radio, channel 22 (157.1 MHz). Mariners may also call the Marine Safety Office, Paducah,
Kentucky for current information.

The Coast Guard finds that the impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies
under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in Sheffield Harbor, around the fireworks barge C&hyph;33 located approximately
1200 feet northwest of the abandoned lighthouse on Sheffield Island, Norwalk, CT from 9:15 p.m. through 10 p.m. on
September 17, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the maritime community from possible navigation hazards
associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port,
Long Island Sound.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 13, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Safety Zone; Widmann Wedding
Fireworks Display, Sheffield Island, CT in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 35661). The deadline for the submission of comments was August 12, 1994. Accordingly, there is insufficient
time available to publish this final rule 30 days in advance of the event. The Coast Guard received no letters commenting
on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. The Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound has
decided to publish the final rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sponsor, Jim Widmann, President of CT Pyro Display Company, South Norwalk, CT has requested that a fireworks display
be permitted in the port of Norwalk in the vicinity of Sheffield Island, Norwalk CT. This safety zone is required to
protect the maritime community from the dangers associated with this fireworks display. The zone covers all waters
of Sheffield Harbor within a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barge C&hyph;33.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety zone will last approximately 45 minutes. The area affected by this event receives infrequent commercial
traffic. Because of the short duration of the event, and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities
will be able to adjust to any disruptions. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal
that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and has determined that these regulations do not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approves Illinois' 1990 base year ozone precursor emission
inventories for certain ozone nonattainment areas as revisions to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan
(SIP). The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Illinois to satisfy a Federal requirement that States
containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with
USEPA guidance. The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking
are: Chicago (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties, Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County,
and Oswego Township in Kendall County); Metro-East St. Louis (Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties); and Jersey
County. In the proposed rules section of this

I. Emission Inventory Policy and Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990 (amended Act), States have the responsibility to inventory emissions
contributing to the violation of National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), to track these emissions over time,
and to ensure that control strategies are implemented to reduce the emissions and move the areas towards attainment
of the NAAQS. States containing ozone nonattainment areas are required, under section 182(a)(1) of the amended Act,
to submit by November 15, 1992, a comprehensive, accurate and current inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions
(emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Oxides of Nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) for each ozone nonattainment area. This inventory must include base year (1990) emissions
from point, area, on-road mobile, and non-road mobile anthropogenic (man-made) sources and biogenic (natural or
plant generated) sources in the ozone nonattainment area(s) and the ozone precursor emissions from major stationary
source (with VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or CO emissions equal to or exceeding 100 tons per year) located within 25 miles of the nonattainment area(s). The
emissions inventory must be established for the peak ozone season (those months when peak hourly ozone concentrations
occur in excess of the primary ozone NAAQS, generally June through August in Illinois) and must represent typical
weekday emissions. Available guidance for preparing and reviewing the emission inventories is provided in the General
Preamble to title I of the Act. See 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992). Additional guidance is identified in the Technical
Support Document (TSD) for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended Act also requires States with ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate, serious, severe, or
extreme to submit a plan by November 15, 1993 to reduce VOC emissions by 15 percent by November 15, 1996. The baseline
level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined by adjusting the base year emissions
inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable toward the 15 percent Reasonable
Further Progress (RFP) requirement. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary emissions inventory from
which the RFP projection inventory, future period inventories, and attainment demonstration modeling inventories
are derived. Further information on these inventories and their purposes can be found in the ``Emission Inventory
Requirements for Ozone State Implementation Plans,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991.

As a primary tool for the review of the quality of emission inventory submittals, the USEPA has developed three levels
(I, II, and III) of emission inventory quality assurance review checklists. The Level I and II reviews are used to determine
that all required components of the base year emission inventory and its associated documentation are present. These
reviews also evaluate the level of quality of the supporting documentation and the data provided by the State and assess
whether the emission estimates were developed according to current USEPA guidance. The Level III review evaluates
10 crucial aspects and the overall acceptability of the emission inventory submittal. Failure to meet one of these
crucial aspects would lead to disapproval of the emission inventory submittal. The 10 crucial aspects of the emission
inventory submittal are:

Detailed Level I and II review procedures and questions may be found in the ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base
Year Emission Inventories,'' United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 1992. Level III criteria are specified in a memorandum from
David Mobley, Emission Inventory Branch, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, USEPA, to the Chief of the
Regulation Development Branch, Region V, et al., titled ``Final Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,''
October 7, 1992.

The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in development and submitting SIP revisions,
including the base year emissions inventory submittal. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each SIP revision
submitted by the State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Final approval of the emissions
inventory would not occur until the State revises the emissions inventory to address public comments. Future changes
to the base year emission inventory (due to previously missed sources or to corrected source emission factors or activity
levels) that impact the 15 percent RFP calculations or the demonstration of attainment or that require a revised emission
control strategy will be required to be addressed in a SIP revision.

II. Illinois' Emission Inventory Submittals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) submitted the final, adopted base year
ozone precursor emission inventories for the Chicago, Metro-East St. Louis (the Illinois portion of the St. Louis/Metro-East
St. Louis ozone nonattainment area), and Jersey County ozone nonattainment areas. The emission inventory submittals
cover the emissions of VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and CO for each of the ozone nonattainment areas as well as the emissions from major stationary sources located within
25 miles of the ozone nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to developing the base year emission inventories, the IEPA developed an IPP as required by the USEPA. This IPP
outlined the procedures that would be followed in preparing and documenting the emission inventories and defined
the QA procedures that would be used to assure the accuracy and completeness of the emission inventories. The IPP was
submitted to the USEPA in March 1992, and was approved by the USEPA in May 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions contained in the emission inventories cover the general source categories of stationary point sources
(or simply point sources), area sources, on-road mobile sources, off-road mobile sources, and biogenic sources.
Emission inventory summary tables in the submittals include more detailed source category breakdowns as requested
by the USEPA. All emission summaries were accompanied by documentation covering the sources and values of input data
and by sample calculations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine point source emissions, the IEPA used permit-based data from the State's Emission Inventory System
(EIS) for all process emission sources in the ozone nonattainment areas and for major sources located within 25 miles
of the ozone nonattainment areas. This data base provided current documentation of the facility-specific and source
type-specific emissions for all facilities with VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or CO emissions to an accuracy of 0.1 pounds per hour. Data obtained from the EIS were cross-referenced with data from
other databases, such as USEPA's Toxic Release Information System (TRIS) and the Illinois Manufacturers Directory
to assure data accuracy and completeness of source coverage. Potentially missing sources were identified and were
contacted concerning their ozone precursor emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The point source portions of the emission inventories contain detailed facility-specific emission listings at
the source segment level as well as facility emission totals. All facilities emitting VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or CO at an actual rate of 10 tons per year or more are covered in the point source emission listings (many facilities
with lower emissions are also included). Emissions were calculated using techniques outlined in the approved IPP
and included the use of emission factors obtained from stack tests, the AP&hyph;42 Compilation of Air Pollution Emission
Factors, and other publications containing current emission factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The point source inventory detailed listings identify the emission factors, source activity levels or throughputs,
operating schedules, and control equipment efficiencies used for each facility and source segment. All emissions
were adjusted in the facility emission totals to reflect weekday emissions for the June through August period. Where
covered by emission controls, total facility emissions were adjusted to account for rule effectiveness and rule
penetration. Sources subject to controls with emission control efficiencies equal to or greater than 95 percent
were covered by facility-specific rule effectiveness studies. For these facilities, rule effectiveness values
determined through the studies were applied to the facility emissions. For those facilities with emission control
efficiencies equal to or greater than 95 percent but not covered specifically in the rule effectiveness studies,
a median rule effectiveness level of 92.1 percent was assumed. For all other facilities, a default rule effectiveness
of 80 percent was assumed. Using guideline emission profiles, the State has adjusted emissions to exclude compounds
considered by the USEPA to be nonreactive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area source emissions were calculated using a variety of information sources and guidance from the USEPA. Where appropriate,
point source emissions have been subtracted from the calculated area source emissions to account for source coverage
overlap between the point source emissions and the area source emissions and to avoid double counting of emissions.
For all source categories covered by emission control regulations, the IEPA has assumed a rule effectiveness level
of 80 percent where sources are covered by emission control regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To estimate the area source emissions, the IEPA primarily relied on the USEPA guidance documents,

EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;016 and EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;014, May 1991. The documentation of the area
source emissions covers the techniques used for each source category. Sample calculations are given for each source
category and input data are documented for each source category by county. The data are well documented in both hard
copy and in computer data files submitted as additional documentation.

On-road mobile source emissions were calculated using USEPA's

and USEPA's MOBILE5a emission factor model. Weekday average Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and speed data by roadway
link were obtained by the IEPA from the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) for the Chicago urban area and from
the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council (EWGCC) for the Metro-East St. Louis urban area. These VMT and speed data
were produced by the application of transportation models in these urban areas. The Illinois Department of Transportation
(IDOT) provided VMT data by county and roadway type for the roadways outside of the urban areas and for roadways in the
urban areas not covered by the transportation models. The VMT data have been quality assured by comparison of modelled
roadway link traffic levels with current traffic counts (the IDOT VMT estimates were derived directly from current
traffic counts). All VMT data supplied by CATS, EWGCC, and IDOT were adjusted, based on monthly traffic data, to reflect
VMT levels during the peak ozone season. To determine speeds for roadways not covered by the CATS and EWGCC urban transportation
models, the IEPA developed tables of speeds by roadway type based on the averages of speeds by roadway types derived
in the CATS and EWGCC urban transportation models. Speeds for both congested periods and for noncongested periods
were considered in the calculation of average day emission levels. The IEPA, based on hourly averaged traffic data,
assumed that 75 percent of the daily VMT occurred at congested period speeds and that 25 percent of the daily VMT occurred
during noncongested periods. It should be noted that the vehicle speeds were generated by the traffic models rather
than generated independently as inputs to the traffic models. The IEPA has reviewed the speed assignments by roadway
type and county and asserts that the speeds generated by the model are conceptually sound and are viewed as being quality
assured.

The IEPA used the modelled VMT and speed data along with other area-specific data, such as the areas' representative
vehicle type distribution based on vehicle registration data, and default data and USEPA's MOBILE5a model to estimate
the on-road mobile source emissions. These emission estimates were adjusted to account for the impacts of vehicle
Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) and the average minimum and maximum daily temperatures on the ten highest ozone
days in each ozone nonattainment area. All input data used in the MOBILE5a modeling were described and documented
in the emission inventory submittals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for railroad locomotives were based on the annual amount of fuel oil used by locomotives
in the ozone nonattainment areas and AP&hyph;42 emission factors. County fuel oil usage rates were calculated by
apportioning State total fuel oil usage based county track mileage. To calculate daily emission rates, locomotive
usage was assumed to be uniform throughout the year and occurring over 61/2 days per week. VOC emissions were multiplied
by 0.98 to remove the emissions of methane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for aircraft were based on landing/takeoff rates for O'Hare and Midway Airports
in the Chicago area accounting for the number and types of engines for each type of plane. Emissions by engine type were
obtained from current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports. Emissions for all other airports were determined
considering annual operations (a landing or a takeoff) for each airport (landing/takeoff rates are assumed to equal
one-half the number of annual operations). For these airports, annual emissions were determined using the derived
landing/takeoff rates and default emission factors obtained from FAA reports. All aircraft emissions, calculated
on an annual basis, were converted to daily emissions assuming uniform operations throughout the year and throughout
the week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for commercial vessels were determined by considering distillate and residual
fuel oil sales data and vessel movement data combined with AP&hyph;42 emission factors. Emissions were apportioned
to counties by considering the county mileage of navigable waterways and tonnage of shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-road mobile source emissions for all other off-road mobile source categories were determined as part of an USEPA
off-road emission study. This 1991 study directly supplied emissions for the Chicago and St. Louis/Metro-East St.
Louis ozone nonattainment areas. Off-road mobile source emissions for Jersey County were derived from the 1991 USEPA
study by proportioning the study derived emissions for the St. Louis area to Jersey County on the basis of population
ratios and other source activity levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biogenic emissions for all three areas were determined using USEPA's PC&hyph;BEIS biogenic emissions calculation
model. Information on land use, an input to the model, was obtained from several sources. Agricultural data for 1990
was obtained from the 1991 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other land use data were taken from the database supplied with the PC&hyph;BEIS model. Meteorological data used with
PC&hyph;BEIS were determined by following USEPA guidance on the use of PC&hyph;BEIS and considering the ten days
(1988 through 1990) with the highest peak hourly ozone concentrations in each ozone nonattainment area. The representative
day (from a meteorological standpoint) was selected as the day with the fourth highest daily maximum ozone concentration
for each ozone nonattainment area. All data considered in the modeling of biogenic emissions were documented in the
emission inventory submittals and included in associated computer-based data files.

The USEPA has conducted Level I, II, and III quality assurance reviews of the Illinois emission inventory submittals
and has concluded that the State of Illinois has met the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act by submitting
an ozone precursor emission inventory that includes comprehensive, accurate, and current actual emissions from
all identified sources in the subject ozone nonattainment areas. In particular, the Illinois submittals meet the
10 crucial criteria contained in the Level III quality assurance review. The emissions inventory is, therefore,
approved for incorporation in the SIP as satisfying the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the amended Act. This
approved SIP revision and the emission levels contained within it will form the basis for subsequent SIP revisions
dealing with RFP and attainment of the ozone standard.

The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be
filed. This action will be effective on November 14, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by October
13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the USEPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
rule that withdraws this final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective November 14, 1994.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small
entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

I. Summary of State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 5, 1987, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted to the USEPA a request for a revision
to the Ohio SIP for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides for sources within specified source categories that require
continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) and reporting. The revision request consisted of CEM requirements contained
in operating permits for 116 associated sources at 37 facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision was submitted to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Clean Air
Act and the specific provisions described in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. Section 110(a)(2)(F) provides that the SIP
must require the installation of equipment to monitor emissions from stationary sources, periodic reporting of
such emissions and correlation of such reports with any emission limitations established in the SIP for source categories
identified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The source categories and the respective monitoring requirements identified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P are listed
below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Fossil fuel-fired steam generators. This category shall be

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This category shall be monitored for opacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Sulfuric acid plants. This category shall be monitored for
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sulfur dioxide emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Nitric acid plants with greater than 300 tons per day

On March 11, 1994, the USEPA published a rulemaking action in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11569) proposing to disapprove the requested revision because the CEM requirements were contained in expired
permits and were no longer enforceable. USEPA stated in the proposed rulemaking action that if the OEPA submitted
up-to-date permits containing approvable CEM requirements for the facilities covered by the revision, USEPA would
approve the revision request through the effective dates of such permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 11, 1994, the OEPA submitted a new revision request to USEPA in response to the March 11, 1994 proposed rulemaking,
along with its comments on the rulemaking. Comments were also received from Dayton Power and Light Company (DP&amp;L),
and Fuller &amp; Henry on behalf of the Environmental Committee of the Ohio Electric Utility Institute and the following
member companies: Buckeye Power, Inc., Columbus Southern Power Company, Dayton Power and Light Company, Ohio Edison
Company, Ohio Power Company, Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, The
Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, and The Toledo Edison Company (Ohio Utilities).

OEPA Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 5, 1987, USEPA approved Ohio EPA's SIP revision based on permits to operate which incorporated the appendix
P sulfur dioxide monitoring requirements for Coulton Chemical Plant in Toledo, Ohio and the E. I. duPont de Nemours
and Company facility in Miami, Ohio that were issued on January 3, and March 25, 1986, respectively.

USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking action involves CEM requirements for particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. As stated
in the proposed rulemaking action, this revision request does not apply to the monitoring of sulfur dioxide emissions
at fossil fuel-fired steam generators and sulfuric acid plants. The sulfur dioxide CEM requirements for the above
facilities were discussed in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rulemaking (54 FR 1693), dated January 17, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OEPA Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Failure on the part of USEPA to act on the opacity monitoring provisions of the SIP in a timely manner has adversely affected
the State since it is required to resubmit additional documentation and be subject to changes in USEPA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Agency is limited to taking action on the revision request that has been formally submitted to it, and has no choice
except to disapprove CEM, recording, and reporting requirements contained in unenforceable expired permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OEPA Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As late as April 8, 1994, Ohio EPA staff has been told that even if OEPA filed the required information in accordance
with the March 11, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the SIP submittal may not be approvable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This comment seems to be the result of a misconception on the part of OEPA. USEPA stated in the March 11, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that if the OEPA submitted up-to-date permits, containing approvable CEM requirements, the USEPA would then approve
the revision request in the final rulemaking action. In an April 5, 1994, discussion regarding furnishing OEPA example
CEM rule language, it was mentioned that USEPA was exploring the possibility of conditionally approving the SIP revision
request in the final action. It was further stated that conditionally approving the revision might not be possible
and the issue would be discussed further with OEPA. No statement was made that the revision might not be approved if
up-to-date permits were submitted to USEPA.

Ohio Utilities Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Ohio Utilities' stated concern with USEPA's proposed disapproval action is OEPA's proposed incorporation of
the CEM program into Ohio's SIP on a permit-by-permit basis. This method of adopting approvable CEM requirements
creates an unnecessary burden on Ohio EPA and the regulated community, fails to recognize the flexibility needed
to operate a successful CEM program, and does not allow for due process as in the case of rulemaking. USEPA should instead
require Ohio EPA to go through rulemaking procedures and adopt 40 CFR part 51, appendix P to satisfy CEM requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ohio Utilities also expressed concern that permit specific CEM requirements place unnecessary burdens on OEPA
and the regulated community and that there is little or no opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA has requested that the OEPA go through rulemaking procedures and adopt the CEM requirements in 40 CFR part
51, appendix P by revising language in existing Ohio Administrative Code rules or by adopting new rules. OEPA's promulgation
of rules will resolve the problems associated with incorporating the CEM requirements into the SIP on a permit-by-permit
basis. The rules would require that all sources in a category listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P install, calibrate,
maintain and operate equipment for continuously monitoring, recording and reporting emissions in accordance with
appendix P's minimum monitoring requirements. Section 119.03 of the Ohio Revised Code requires OEPA to provide public
notice and hold a public hearing when rules are adopted, amended or rescinded. Written or oral comments may be presented
at the public hearing. The rules would then be submitted to the USEPA as a SIP revision request. Thus, all interested
parties would have an opportunity to comment before the revision to the SIP becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ohio Utilities Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Ohio Utilities expressed concern about the fact that circumstances at a facility may change requiring a change
in the CEM monitoring requirements and the facility would have to follow existing permit requirements, even though
inapplicable, until OEPA revises the SIP. Additionally, Ohio Utilities expressed concern that the OEPA may have
erroneously incorporated CEM requirements into permits for sources not covered by appendix P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA understands the concerns of the Ohio Utilities. Instead of incorporating CEM requirements on a permit-by-permit
basis, USEPA has requested that the OEPA revise existing rules or adopt new rules to incorporate the CEM requirements,
for specified source categories, into the Ohio SIP. Any revised rules adopted by the State to establish its CEM program
must meet all of the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Clean Air Act and the specific provisions
contained in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. As to the point regarding erroneous incorporation of CEM requirements into
permits, it is not clear to USEPA which sources are being referred to by the Ohio Utilities. However, before the new
rules are incorporated in the Ohio SIP, the regulated community will be given an opportunity to comment regarding
the appropriateness of CEM requirements being applied to sources. Also, see USEPA's response below that addresses
concerns about CEM requirements for two facilities. Adherence to the State and the Federal administrative procedure
acts will ensure that the regulated community is afforded the due process associated with rulemaking actions. The
CEM requirements being approved by this rulemaking action will be effective through the expiration date of the permits.

USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OEPA submitted a SIP revision request, consisting of Permits to Operate to USEPA on January 5, 1987, and requested
that USEPA rulemake only on those portions of the permits pertaining to the CEM requirements. The Longworth Station,
Application No. 0857040016 B004, was identified in OEPA's January 5, 1987, submittal as a fossil fuel-fired steam
generator with greater than 250 million BTU per hour heat input that requires CEM. The Permit to Operate for Longworth
Station, Application Number 0857040016 B004 in OEPA's April 11, 1994, revised submittal does not contain CEM requirements,
but instead provides for visible emission readings. Therefore, USEPA is not rulemaking on the Longworth Station
Permit to Operate.

DP&amp;L Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DP&amp;L's Hutchings Station has demonstrated to the State that it has an annual average capacity factor of less than
30 percent for its boilers and, pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 2.1 is not subject to CEM requirements.
Because of the low annual average capacity factor, neither Ohio EPA nor the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency
have required Hutchings Station to install opacity monitors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 2.1 requires CEM for fossil fuel-fired steam generators with an annual average
capacity factor of greater than 30 percent as reported to the Federal Power Commission, or as otherwise demonstrated
to the State by the owner or operator. The Special Terms and Conditions contained in the Permits to Operate submitted
to USEPA by OEPA on April 11, 1994 for DP&amp;L, Hutchings Station, Application Numbers 0857780013 B001 through 0857780013
B006, require that Hutchings Station undergo an annual review to determine if continuous opacity monitors must be
installed. As requested by OEPA, USEPA is rulemaking only on the portions of the permits that contain CEM requirements.
Therefore, USEPA is not rulemaking on the DP&amp;L, Hutchings Station, Permits to Operate.

DP&amp;L Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DP&amp;L expressed its concern about the CEM requirements being approved only through the effective dates of the
permits and about the fact that the OEPA has not adopted rules to incorporate the CEM program requirements into the
Ohio SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
USEPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated previously in USEPA's response to the Ohio Utilities comment, USEPA has requested that OEPA adopt new or
revised rules for incorporating the CEM requirements of 40 CFR part 51, appendix P into the Ohio SIP. As to the limited
duration of the approval, CEM plans are required by 40 CFR 51.214 to contain legally enforceable procedures for requiring
stationary sources listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, to install and operate CEM equipment. In this instance, USEPA
can only approve the CEM requirements through the effective date of the permits, because expired permits are not legally
enforceable and would, therefore, not meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 52, appendix P.

Nitric acid plants of greater than 300 tons per day production capacity must be monitored for nitrogen oxides. The
State of Ohio does not have any nitric acid plants that exceed the 300 ton per day production capacity. Therefore, USEPA

On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on

., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve

new requirements. I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

USEPA's disapproval of a portion of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect
any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place
after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover,
USEPA's disapproval of a portion of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA
certifies that this action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it
does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to an adverse comment, EPA is removing approval of a moderate nonattainment area state implementation plan (SIP)
revision for La Grande, Oregon, submitted by the State of Oregon for the purpose of bringing about attainment of the
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or
equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The original action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 1, 1994, as a direct final rule. 59 FR 33914. As stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, if adverse or critical comments were received by August 1, 1994, the effective date would be delayed and timely
notice would be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, due to receiving an adverse comment within the comment period, EPA is removing approval of the SIP revision
and will address all public comments received in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule also published
on July 1, 1994. 59 FR 33941. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Portions of the EEZ around Hawaii and Guam are closed to longline fishing in order to prevent conflicts with users of
other types of fishing gear. In &sect;685.23, the listing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinates for the waters around Guam that are closed to longline fishing contains an error that was made in a final
rule document published October 6, 1992 (57 FR 45989). This technical amendment corrects that error in order to provide
the public and enforcement entities the proper coordinates.

Because this technical amendment makes only a minor correction to an existing rule, notice and public comment thereon
and a delay in effective date would serve no purpose. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), notice and public
comment thereon and a delay in the effective date are unnecessary.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and made a minor revision in February 1987. To update the Circular, OMB established
an interagency task force to review the Circular. The task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular
from university groups, non-profit organizations and other interested parties and compared, for consistency,
the provisions of similar provisions applied to State and local governments. On November 29, 1993, OMB issued a revised
circular which reflects the results of these efforts. This final rule adopts the revised circular as it pertains to
HUD. However, this rule contains, in subpart E, special provisions relating to the use of lump sum grants. Therefore,
subpart E will be treated as an interim rule, and the public is invited to submit comments on subpart E.

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;110 provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;110 was issued under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 503 (the Chief Financial Officers Act), 31 U.S.C.
1111, 41 U.S.C. 405 (the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act), Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, and E.O. 11541
(``Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive
Office of the President'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and made a minor revision in February 1987. To update the circular, OMB established
an interagency task force to review the circular. The task force solicited suggestions for changes to the circular
from university groups, non-profit organizations and other interested parties and compared, for consistency,
the provisions of similar provisions applied to State and local governments. On August 27, 1992, OMB published a notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at 57 FR 39018, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Interested parties were invited
to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional
organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing the final revision. On November 29, 1993, at
58 FR 62992, OMB issued a revised circular which reflects the results of these efforts. This final rule represents
HUD's adoption of the revised circular as part 84 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations and sets forth the provisions
and procedures HUD will follow in compliance with the uniform requirements set for Federal agencies in the newly revised
OMB Circular A&hyph;110 regarding the administration of grants to and agreements with institutions of higher education,
hospitals, commercial organizations and international organizations when operating domestically, and other
non-profit organizations. If any statute specifically prescribes policies or specific requirements that differ
from the standards provided herein, the provisions of the statute shall govern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients shall apply the provisions of this Circular to subrecipients performing substantive work under grants
and agreements that are passed through or awarded by the primary recipient. This rule does not apply to grants, contracts,
or other agreements between HUD and units of State or local governments covered by OMB Circular A&hyph;102, ``Administrative
Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State, Local and Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments,''
as codified in 24 CFR part 85. In addition, subawards and contracts to State or local governments are not covered by
this rule. However, this rule applies to subawards made by State and local governments to organizations covered by
this rule. HUD shall apply the provisions of this part to commercial organizations and international organizations
(when operating domestically). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``award'' does not include technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; other
assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, capital advances under the Sections 202 and 811 programs, interest
subsidies, or insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; and, contracts which are required to be entered
into and administered under procurement laws and regulations. Therefore, this rule does not apply to these types
of activities. Consequently, this rule does not apply to any matter involving funds which would be covered by a regulatory
agreement between a mortgagor and the Secretary, executed under Sections 201, 207(b), 232(d)(1), 242(d)(1), and
236 (including Rental Assistance Payments) of the National Housing Act; Section 101(a) of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1965; and Section 201(a) of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978.

Justification for Interim and Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that notice and public comment are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest
before making this rule effective because the substance of the rule received public comment when the circular was
published on August 27 1992. All comments received were reviewed and considered in the development of the revised
circular. However, the Department will accept and review any comments received on subpart E because of the selective
use of certain provisions as they apply to the use of lump sum grants.

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office
of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. It pertains only to the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher
education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations.

recipient transfers funds to another entity and that entity is the project. A distinction is made between such a transfer
for the furtherance of the prime recipient's goals and the transfer of funds to a subrecipient who carries out activities
and is accountable to the prime recipient. For example, in a CDBG award where a prime recipient has as its program goal
the revitalization of a downtown area, the funds transferred to a business in the downtown area to remodel its store
would not be considered a subaward subject to this part 84.

Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In each instance, HUD shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract).
The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements
and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to
accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for
choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected
between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated
in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for
the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the

to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. HUD shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580, 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or
agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section 6002.
Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing
recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts
247 through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, commercial organizations
and international organizations when operating domestically, and non-profit organizations that receive direct
Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds
to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in &sect;84.52. If a recipient maintains its records on other
than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients
may develop such accrual data for their reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.

and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.

(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, HUD, at its
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient
are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business

State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in &sect;84.21.
Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special HUD instructions

(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. HUD
may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished
through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the
project.

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the billing is improper.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and HUD has determined that reimbursement is not feasible
because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, HUD may provide cash on a working capital advance basis.
Under this procedure, HUD shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial
period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, HUD shall reimburse the recipient for its
actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling
or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, HUD shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at
any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, HUD may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, HUD shall not require separate depository
accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds
provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women- owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraphs (k)(1),
(k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules (31 CFR part
206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE
Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. Interest amounts up to $250 per year
may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with
CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary
awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest
under CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this rule, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of HUD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If HUD authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraphs
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.

The current fair market value.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, when there is sufficient justification, HUD may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated
property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraphs (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that HUD has approved the charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall
be documented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The inclusion, unless waived by HUD, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;21,
``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit
Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74 Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, HUD is authorized, at its option,
to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by Circular A&hyph;110 and OMB Circulars
A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of HUD.
All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., HUD is under no obligation to reimburse such costs
if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover
such costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify HUD in writing with the supporting reasons
and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension
may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) HUD may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and
activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such
transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by HUD. HUD shall not permit
a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent
with the original intent of the appropriation.

(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by
OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) When HUD makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, HUD may require
the recipient to request prior approval from HUD before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, HUD shall require recipients to notify HUD in writing promptly
whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period
by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required
if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application
unless HUD indicates a letter of request suffices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, HUD shall review the request
and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with

HUD prescribes the following requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired
in whole or in part under awards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by HUD for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects
when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in
other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have
purposes consistent with those authorized for support by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from HUD or its successor Federal awarding agency. HUD shall observe one or more
of the following disposition instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by HUD and pay the Federal Government
for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in
the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds).
When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.

Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to HUD. Upon completion of the award or when the
property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to HUD for further HUD utilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If HUD has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless HUD has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by HUD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When statutory authority exists, HUD has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions HUD considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should HUD not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the equipment without
approval of HUD. When the equipment is no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use
the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by HUD which funded the original project; then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by HUD that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or
programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by HUD. User charges
shall be treated as program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to HUD or its successor. The amount of compensation
shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program
to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from HUD. HUD shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet HUD's requirements.
If no requirement exists within HUD, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration
by HUD to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. HUD shall issue instructions
to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall

Purpose of procurement standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 84.41 through 84.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by HUD upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or approved by OMB.

Recipient responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to HUD, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

Codes of conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

Competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
The other factors shall include the bidder's or offeror's compliance with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), hereafter referred to as ``Section 3.'' Section 3 provides that, to the greatest extent
feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws, and regulations, economic opportunities
generated by certain HUD financial assistance shall be directed to low- and very low-income persons. Solicitations
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most
economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity; compliance with public policy, including, where applicable, Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u); record of past performance; financial and technical resources or accessibility to
other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by implementation
of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' at 24 CFR part 24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement
documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of
the following conditions apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in HUD's implementation
of Circular A&hyph;110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed $100,000 or the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11), whichever
is greater, and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, HUD may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided HUD has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, HUD, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

be due 30 days after the reporting period. HUD may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple
year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration
or termination of the award.

of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) HUD requires recipients to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction
projects or programs. HUD has the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request
for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate
information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion
of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If HUD requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required
to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis
of the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) HUD shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD requires recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two copies) no
later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar
days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by HUD upon request of the recipient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients HUD shall require each recipient to submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary,
its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. HUD shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain
disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, HUD may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount
of cash advances received and retained in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. HUD may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances
totaling $1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) HUD may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in HUD's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When HUD needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, HUD shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When HUD determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in &sect;84.21, additional
pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time
as the system is brought up to standard. HUD, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements
of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) HUD will shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) HUD may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts
or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HUD may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy
of reporting.

Retention and access requirements for records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. HUD
shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by HUD. The only exceptions are the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by HUD, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the
recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocation plans, etc. as specified in &sect;84.53(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HUD shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, HUD may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) HUD, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives,
have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that
are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents.
This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and
discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph (e) are not limited to the required retention
period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, HUD shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when HUD can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records
had belonged to HUD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records_indirect
cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate
at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit
rates).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If submitted for negotiation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the recipient submits to HUD or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation
to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on
the date of such submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered
by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

Remedies for noncompliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute,
regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, HUD may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions
outlined in &sect;84.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity
or action not in compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hearings and appeals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effects of suspension and termination
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless HUD expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.

Definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A lump sum award is an award for a predetermined amount, as set forth in the grant agreement, which amount does not
vary with the amount of the recipient's actual incurred costs. Under this type of award, HUD does not pay the recipient
for its incurred costs but rather for completing certain defined events in the work or achievement of some other well-defined
milestone. Some of the ways in which the grant amount may be paid are, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In several partial payments, the amount of each agreed upon in advance, and the ``milestone'' or event triggering
the payment also agreed upon in advance, and set forth in the grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On a unit price basis, for a defined unit or units (such as a housing counseling unit), at a defined price or prices,
agreed to in advance of performance of the grant and set forth in the grant; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In one payment at grant completion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The key distinction between a lump sum and a cost reimbursement grant is the lack of a direct relationship between
the costs incurred by the recipient and the amount paid by HUD in the lump sum arrangement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the provisions of this subpart E, subparts A and B of this part apply to lump sum grants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Financial and program management. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making
payments, budget revision approvals, and making audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standards for financial management systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities are
required. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations,
unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets are required. Recipients
shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award is required. Whenever appropriate, financial information
should be related to performance and unit cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where HUD guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, HUD, at its discretion, may require
adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate
to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HUD may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The standard governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards
is, HUD shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility
requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for
the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
payments. HUD shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has adopted the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined
advance methods are not used. The SF-270 shall also be used for lump sum payment requests. HUD, however, has the option
of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement
for Construction Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has adopted the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs.
However, HUD may substitute the SF-270 when HUD determines that it provides adequate information to meet HUD's needs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revision of budget and program plans. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may
include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon HUD requirements. It
shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are required to report deviations from program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program
plan revisions, in accordance with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from HUD for one or more of the following
program or budget related reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring
prior written approval).

following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify HUD in writing with the supporting reasons

unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The extension requires additional Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) When HUD makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, HUD may require
the recipient to request prior approval from HUD before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-Federal audits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations shall
be subject to the audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education
and Other Non-Profit Institutions,'' as codified in 24 CFR part 44. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C.

Purpose of property standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property
furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. HUD shall require
recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically
required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided
it observes the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Insurance coverage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired
with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless
required by the terms and conditions of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Real property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD prescribes the following requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired
in whole or in part under awards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient shall obtain written approval by HUD for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects
when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in
other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have
purposes consistent with those authorized for support by HUD.

Federally-owned and exempt property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to HUD. Upon
completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to HUD for
further HUD utilization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If HUD has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless HUD has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When statutory authority exists, HUD has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions HUD considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should HUD not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the equipment without
approval of HUD. When the equipment is no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use
the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Activities sponsored by HUD which funded the original project; then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by HUD that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or
programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on
other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(F) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify HUD.

(5) HUD may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal
Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to
the following standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was
purchased, under an award. HUD reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish,
or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide
regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations
and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition
in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of procurement standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for
the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal
funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner
and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement
standards or requirements shall be imposed by HUD upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute
or executive order or approved by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recipient responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to HUD, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Codes of conduct. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Competition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
The other factors shall include the bidder's or offeror's compliance with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), hereafter referred to as ``Section 3.'' Section 3 provides that, to the greatest extent
feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws, and regulations, economic opportunities
generated by certain HUD financial assistance shall be directed to low- and very low-income persons. Solicitations
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most
economical and practical procurement for the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity; compliance with public policy, including, where applicable, Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u); record of past performance; financial and technical resources or accessibility to
other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies'
implementation of E.O.'s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' as set forth at 24 CFR part 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement
documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of
the following conditions apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in HUD's implementation
of Circular A&hyph;110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed $100,000 or the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11), whichever
is greater, and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost and price analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procurement records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following
at a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Basis for contractor selection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Basis for award cost or price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract administration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall
evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions
and specifications of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, HUD may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided HUD has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond''
is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, HUD, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this rule, as applicable.

Purpose of reports and records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial
and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Monitoring and reporting program performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
as delineated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;84.82(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year;
quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may
require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final
performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Recipients shall immediately notify HUD of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) HUD may make site visits, as needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Retention and access requirements for records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This paragraph (c) sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients.
Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by HUD. The only exceptions are the following. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final
disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement
is not applicable to the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) HUD shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, HUD may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) HUD, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives,
have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that
are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents.
This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and
discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph (c)(5) are not limited to the required
retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Unless required by statute, HUD shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when HUD can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records
had belonged to HUD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), or (a)(1)(iii) of this
section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By HUD, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) By HUD with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions,
including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) By the recipient upon sending to HUD written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if HUD determines
in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes
for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in &sect;84.87(a)(1),
including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision
shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If costs are allowed, the cost principles in &sect;84.27 apply, even though the award was made on a lump-sum basis.
Alternatively, a termination settlement may be reached by prorating the grant amount against the percentage of completion
or by some other method as determined by the Grant Officer, as long as the method used results in an equitable settlement
to both parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute,
regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, HUD may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions
outlined in &sect;84.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement
action by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hearings and appeals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In taking an enforcement action, HUD shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative
proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effects of suspension and termination
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless HUD expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is proposing to revise regulations on spousal
rights in accordance with changes made to the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) by Public Law
103&hyph;226 to delete all references to former spouses and to accord all spouses of TSP participants covered by the
Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) the right to a survivor annuity, unless they waive that option.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 103&hyph;226, 108 Stat. 111 (March 30, 1994), amends FERSA, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 and section 8351, to give
all TSP participants, regardless of their eligibility for basic retirement benefits, the same withdrawal options
upon separation that have previously been available only to participants who separate with eligibility for basic
retirement benefits. As a result, spouses of all TSP participants, regardless of the participant's eligibility
for basic retirement benefits, have been provided with the same rights as those previously available to spouses of
participants who were eligible for basic retirement benefits. This means that spouses of FERS participants who were
previously only entitled to notice (if the participant separated without eligibility for basic retirement benefits)
now have the right to a survivor annuity, unless the spouse waives that right. The required annuity is a joint life annuity
with the spouse with 50 percent survivor benefits, level payments, and a no cash refund feature. As a result of this
statutory change, 5 CFR 1650.17 has been revised to delete the requirement to notify the spouse with the TSP participant
who is covered by FERS lacks eligibility for basic retirement benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Spouses of Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) participants are entitled to notice whether or not the participant
separated from Federal service with eligibility for basic retirement benefits. This notice requirement was not
affected by Public Law 103&hyph;226.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;226 also eliminates the requirement to notify former spouses of FERS and CSRS participants who
separate from Federal service without eligibility for basic retirement benefits that the participant is withdrawing
his or her TSP account. Accordingly, all references to former spouse have been eliminated from 5 CFR part 1650, subpart
G. (Because there are no longer any references to ``former spouses,'' the word ``current'' has also been eliminated
wherever it appeared to describe the spouse to whom a participant is married.) This means that participants are no
longer required to provide the TSP Service Office with an address for a former spouse, or, if a former spouse cannot
be located, to obtain an exception to the requirement to notify a former spouse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;226, other changes explain or clarify spousal rights and exceptions
to those rights. Section 1650.19 is revised to delete language stating that the employee and spouse may jointly waive
the survivor annuity. The participant waives the survivor annuity by electing a different withdrawal option, while
it is the spouse who must explicitly sign a waiver statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1650.21 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement to obtain the spouse's
signature or the spouse notice requirement where the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive
Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. The requirement to obtain the spouse's signature on
the appropriate form to waive the joint and survivor annuity is referred to as the signature requirement. The notice
requirement refers to the entitlement of the spouse of a CSRS participant to notice of the participant's withdrawal
election. This section is being revised to allow participants who are seeking an exception to the signature or the
notice requirement based on whereabouts unknown to submit statements in lieu of affidavits or declarations in support
of their requests. These statements must be made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides that whoever, in any matter
within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals
or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements
or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious
or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the persons making the statements are aware of the possible penalty, &sect;1650.21(c) requires inclusion
of the following on each statement: I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable
under Federal Law (18 U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ease the burden on participants further, &sect;&sect;1650.21 and 1650.22 are being revised to delete the requirement
that the participant obtain and provide only documents bearing an original signature or which are embossed or which
bear the imprint of a seal. Participants may now submit photocopies of documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1650.21(d) and 1650.22(c) are added to explain that a withdrawal form received within one year of approval
of the exception may be processed without a new exception. An exception is valid only for the spouse for whom the exception
has been approved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1650.21(e) and 1650.22(d) are added to explain that the requirements for establishing an exception in a
loan application in 5 CFR 1655.18 are the same as those for establishing an exception in a withdrawal application.
It is for this purpose that the loan provisions are cross-referenced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;1650.22 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement that the participant
obtain his or her spouse's signature where there are exceptional circumstances that warrant such an exception. In
&sect;1650.22(b)(2)(iii) the example of an acceptable court order which would relieve a participant of the obligation
to obtain his or her spouse's signature is revised.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever in the regulations in this subpart it is required that the Executive Director give notice of an action to the
spouse of a participant, an exception to this requirement may be granted in cases in which the participant establishes
to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for an
exception based on whereabouts unknown must be submitted to the Executive Director on the appropriate TSP form accompanied
by either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A judicial determination (court order) which states that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A police or Governmental agency determination that is signed by the appropriate department or division head which
states that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Statements by the participant and two other persons. Each statement must be signed and dated and must state the
following: I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable under Federal Law (18
U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The participant's statement must give the full name of his or her spouse, declare the inability to locate the spouse,
and state the efforts made to locate the spouse. Negative statements such as ``I have not seen or heard from him/her''
or ``I have had no contact with him/her'' are not sufficient. Examples of attempting to locate the spouse include checking
with relatives and mutual friends or using telephone directories or directory assistance for the city of last known
address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The statements from two other persons must support the participant's statement that the participant does not
know the whereabouts of his or her spouse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A withdrawal election received within one year of an approved exception may be processed so long as the spouse named
on the form is the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The requirements for establishing an exception for a withdrawal and the one-year period of validity of an approved
exception apply to exceptions for loans under 5 CFR 1655.18.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Executive Director's exception to the requirement to obtain the spouse's signature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wherever in the regulations in this subpart the spouse's signature is required, the Executive Director may grant
an exception to this requirement if the participant can show that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined in accordance with the provisions of &sect;1650.21; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the spouse's signature would otherwise be inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An exception to the spousal signature requirement may be granted based on exceptional circumstances only when
the participant presents a judicial determination (court order) or a governmental agency determination signed
by the appropriate department or division head. A court order or a determination must contain a finding or a recitation
of such exceptional circumstances regarding the spouse as would warrant an exception to the signature requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exceptional circumstances is narrowly construed and includes such circumstances as when a court order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Indicates that the spouse and the participant have been maintaining separate residences with no financial relationship
for three or more years;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Indicates that the spouse abandoned the participant but, for religious or similarly compelling reasons, the
parties chose not to divorce; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Expressly states that the participant may obtain a loan from his or her Thrift Savings Plan account or withdraw
his or her thrift Savings Plan account balance notwithstanding the absence of the spouse's signature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A withdrawal election received within one year of an approved exception may be processed so long as the spouse named
on the form is the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The requirements for establishing an exception for a withdrawal and the one-year period of validity of an approved
exception apply to exceptions for loans under 5 CFR 1655.18.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866 review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions
of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting
a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the
petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the
ruling.

Effect on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption
level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41
percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It
is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate
increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying
hens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment
of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The
present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton
of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent
of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average
wholesale price for New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991&hyph;93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately
$7.5 million annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent
assessment. It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened
research and promotion programs.

Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No additional recordkeeping requirements would be imposed as a result of this proposed rule. It has been estimated
that it will take an average of about 30 minutes for each of the approximately 380 egg producers to participate in the
voluntary referendum balloting.

Background and Proposed Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) was amended December 14, 1993 (Pub. Law 103&hyph;188.
The amendments raised the maximum rate of assessment paid by egg producers to the American Egg Board (AEB) from 10 cents
to 20 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. The actual rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order
and is currently 5 cents per case. Any increase from the 5 cents must be approved by producers voting in a referendum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule to increase the assessment rate in the Order from 5 cents to 10 cents per case was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31174). Comments were solicited from interested persons through August 16, 1994. Two comments
were received; one from a major egg producer organization in support and one from an egg producer in opposition to the
increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter who opposed the increase cited the decline in number of egg producers from 10,000 to 400 since AEB has
been in existence and that AEB programs have not halted the decline. However, the decrease in the number of producers
paying assessments is the result of several factors. First, when AEB was first implemented in 1976, more than 6,000
producers owning over 3,000 laying hens were on record. By 1989, the number had decreased to approximately 2,000 due
to consolidations and bankruptcies during a time when the economic situation was poor. In 1990, the exemption level
was changed to 30,000 laying hens, decreasing the number of producers by 36 percent. The exemption level was changed
again on August 1, 1994, to 75,000 hens, reducing the number to just under 400 producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also expressed disapproval that a large percentage of the proposed increase in funds might be used for
advertising, resulting in a temporary boost in demand and that such demand would be quickly swallowed up by expanded
production. The commenter also noted that AEB has a function in the industry but must remain lean to ensure funds are
spent wisely. The commenter expressed concern that AEB not look for budget expenditures to justify the increased
assessment. AEB's administrative costs have steadily remained at approximately 3 percent. Further, as required
by the 1993 amendments to the Act, AEB submitted to the Department a marketing analysis showing the need for an assessment
increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter was also opposed to the referendum voting rules. The commenter indicated that the rules allow the number
of hens owned to give more weight to the vote, thereby granting larger producers more voting power. The Act provides
that a referendum vote will pass if approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers voting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by a majority of producers voting if they represent not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further was of the view that the assessment rate should remain at its current level of 5 cents, that producers
should be allowed to voluntarily give an extra 5 or 10 cents, and that refunds should be available. The Act was amended
in 1993 to provide that AEB may recommend an increased assessment rate to the Secretary. In accordance with the provisions
of the Act, AEB has done so, and the assessment increase as proposed herein will be subject to a referendum vote. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is directed that, in accordance with the procedures for the conduct of referenda (7 CFR 1250.200 et seq.), a referendum
will be held beginning September 26, 1994, and ending on October 14, 1994, to determine whether producers favor the
increase to 10 cents per case as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9 of the Act requires approval by eligible egg producers engaged in commercial egg production during the representative
period and at the time of voting. The representative period for the conduct of the referendum is determined to be May
1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Order amendment to be approved, it must be favored by at least two-thirds of the producers voting in this referendum

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by a majority of the producers voting if such majority represents not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced
by those voting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agents of the Secretary to conduct the referendum are hereby designated to be Janice L. Lockard and Angela C. Clonts,
both of the Poultry Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. The agents may appoint subagents to assist them
in performing their duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ballots, instructions, eligibility requirements, and other information pertinent to the referendum will be mailed
to all known eligible egg producers. In accordance with Public Law 103&hyph;188 and recent amendments to the implementing
Order (59 FR 38875), producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments under the Act
and are therefore not eligible to vote in the referendum.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the acreage reduction percentage, if any, and the national
average price support rate for the 1995 crop of rice. This action is required by section 101B of the Agricultural Act
of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This proposed rule outlines a range of acreage reduction percentage options proposed
for the 1995 crop of rice and requests comments regarding price support rate adjustments for different types and grades
of rice.

It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject
matter of this rule. A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis was prepared that determined that this regulation
will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction
percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in
the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule
and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 101B of the 1949 Act, an acreage reduction program (ARP) may be implemented for the 1995
rice crop if it is determined that the total supply of rice, in the absence of such a program, would be excessive taking
into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices, and to meet
a national emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of rice to desirable
goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the considered program options, it is not needed
to achieve the statutory stocks-to-use levels of rice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 35 percent)
to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each rice producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of
acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the
Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Producers who knowingly produce rice in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any rice acreage planted
in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect
to that crop on the farm.

The Secretary is required to carry out an acreage limitation program in a manner that will result in carry-over stocks
equal to 16.5 to 20.0 percent of the simple average of the total disappearance (including domestic, export, and residual
disappearance) of rice for each of the 3 marketing years preceding the year for which the announcement is made. The

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to amend special conditions issued to British Aerospace Public Limited Company (BAe) (Currently
Jetstream Aircraft Limited) for the BAe Model 4100 airplane. This airplane has a novel or unusual design feature associated
with the main cabin aisle arrangement. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued on July 9, 1991, addressing
this unusual arrangement, and included a limitation on passenger capacity. The applicant has requested that the
special conditions be amended to increase the passenger capacity limit from 29 to 30 passengers. Since the special
conditions were issued the applicant has changed the company name and revised the model number of the airplane. This
amendment of the special conditions should also reflect these changes. Since the applicable airworthiness regulations
do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this particular design feature, this notice contains
the additional safety standards which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent
to that established by the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 24, 1989, BAe Public Limited Company (currently Jetstream Aircraft Ltd.) applied for a type certificate for
the BAe Model 4100 (currently Jetstream Model 4101) airplane in the transport airplane category. The Model 4100 was
to be a derivative of the Model 3100, which is a small airplane and is certificated under the provisions of part 23. Like
the Model 3100, the Model 4100 was a low wing, twin engine turbo-prop design. The fuselage was stretched, however,
to seat 29 passengers in a three-abreast arrangement. Since the Model 4100 airplane had the same fuselage cross section
as the Model 3100, it did not have a traditional main cabin aisle arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 25.815 species the minimum aisle width dimensions for transport category airplanes based on the passenger
capacity. For airplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, a minimum 15-inch width at heights 25 inches or less above
the main aisle floor and a minimum 20-inch width at heights greater than 25 inches above the floor must be maintained.
Aisle width is measured at any point along the aisle, normal to the centerline of the aisle. The main aisle envisioned
by the regulations would run in a straight line from one end of the passenger cabin to the other and would satisfy these
width criteria. Long standing FAA policy has permitted slight deviation from a straight line where there is a transition
from one cabin section to another, or where there are interior features which dictate that the aisle move laterally.
For example, from tourist class to first class there may be a change from five-abreast seating to four-abreast seating
which moves the aisle centerline laterally. This has been accepted provided the required widths are maintained at
all heights normal to the path that an individual would take. This type of offset normally occurs at one or two points
in a main cabin aisle. In addition, there is no offset permitted in the aisle vertically; that is, the required 15-inch
dimension must lie completely below the projected 20-inch dimension at all points along the aisle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Jetstream main cabin aisle arrangement utilizes an offset at each seat row. The left and right seat assemblies
are offset from one another longitudinally such that the seatbacks are not opposite each other across the aisle. This
arrangement permits a 20-inch measurement between seatbacks (at an angle to the airplane centerline) and the required
15-inch dimension is maintained within the projected 20-inch dimension vertically. Thus the ``required aisle''
is not a straight line from one end of the cabin to the other, but a series of alternating angular segments from seatback
to seatback. Nonetheless, there 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a straight path along the cabin length, and the aisle floor does not deviate from side to side at all. The projected aisle
width along this straight path reaches 20 inches at a height of 43 inches above the floor, which is the typical seatback
height for transport airplanes. Another feature of the design includes the use of overwing exits which are offset
longitudinally, corresponding to the seat positions on the left and right of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide design standards for the novel and unusual aisle configuration in the BAe Model 4100 airplanes,
the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 on July 9, 1991. The criteria used to develop Special Conditions
No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 utilized the existing regulations, and made certain favorable design features in the Model
4100 mandatory. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 are summarized as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. There are no more than 29 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The interior arrangement includes one pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height
of 43 inches above the aisle floor;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
d. The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one
end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the
cabin;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil
airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The content of the special conditions was based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed by BAe. The specific
limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered that the fact that
this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination was a significant
factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to issuing the Special Conditions 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate
for that project British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited and changed
the model designation for the airplane from BAe Model 4100 to the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM was
issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993 for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated
that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model
4101, Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes
that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration.

The certification basis for the Model 4101 is established in accordance with &sect;21.29, using the Joint Aviation
Regulations (JAR) as a reference point, with appropriate additional requirements incorporated to provide an equivalent
certification basis to the FAR requirements for U.S. certification. British Aerospace and the Civil Aviation Authorities
(CAA)&hyph;UK elected to have the type certification basis be the following:

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25 as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual
design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety
equivalent to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 after public notice, as required
by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

As in the case of the 29 seat version, the required main cabin aisle widths would be established using measurements
taken between seatbacks, which form a path in angular segments. The aisle width measured normal to the fuselage centerline
above 25 inches from the floor, would extend from the seat back to the opposite cabin sidewall. Thus, while the required
15-inch dimension at cabin heights below 25 inches from the floor would be completely within the projected 20-inch
width vertically, the 20-inch position would not be centered over the 15-inch position (See Figure 1.)

In establishing Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, the FAA carefully evaluated the relevant design parameters
of the BAe Model 4100 and determined that the main aisle configuration is clearly not what was envisioned by the regulations.
The regulations do not specifically prohibit the arrangement proposed; however, the policy in effect is predicated
on a largely straight aisle which has only one or two lateral deviations; in other words, a traditional cabin arrangement.
Therefore, special conditions were developed to establish design criteria which result in a level of safety equivalent
to configurations on which the regulations were based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has requested that the FAA amend Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 to allow a maximum passenger
capacity of 30, to account for a new customer demand, and be responsive to the market. In their request Jetstream contends
that there is no technical basis for the limitation on passenger capacity, and that the Joint Aviation Authorities
(JAA) have, in fact, already granted such approval. Jetstream has proposed that on the basis of harmonization with
the JAA, the FAA should consider their request favorably. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream further contends that the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions
for the 29 passenger Model 4101 illustrated that there is no impediment due to the aisle arrangement for 30 passengers.
Jetstream argues that the concern that prompted the requirement was therefore demonstrated not to exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the special conditions, the FAA took account of the several favorable cabin safety features that the
29 passenger Model 4101 incorporates. One of the major features was the good exit-to-passenger ratio for the number
of passengers requested. That is, one pair of Type II exits and one pair of Type III exits for 29 passenger seats, where
the regulations allow up to 39. In this regard, 29 passenger seats was the largest arrangement proposed for a US customer.
Consequently, the FAA did not consider a greater passenger capacity, and the issue of harmonization did not come up.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions, this demonstration
was a modified version of the demonstration specified in part 25, Appendix J. The principal modification was the use
of a single exit (in this case, the forward Type I exit) instead of one half of the total number of exits installed. The
demonstration was conducted this way in order to provide for maximum usage of the aisle, by the maximum number of passengers.
While this demonstration was completed in 54 seconds, the resultant overall rates of egress were not particularly
fast for this type of exit. In addition, the evacuees appeared to steady themselves on seatbacks to a higher degree
than is typically seen in such demonstrations. Thus, while there was no clear obstruction due to the aisle, the overall
egress rates did seem to be somewhat reduced. The FAA therefore considers that the aisle arrangement should result
in a limit on maximum passenger capacity that is reduced over the theoretical limit in the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jetstream has requested that the FAA increase the current limit, which they believe is arbitrary, and allow up to 30
passengers in accordance with same special conditions. As noted by the applicant the demonstration conducted for
approval of the 29 passenger version Model 4101 did include 30 occupants in the passenger cabin (to account for the
JAA approved arrangement) and was completed well within the allowable time. Therefore, from the standpoint of amending
the special conditions, an additional demonstration would not be required. While the limit of 29 passengers is somewhat
arbitrary, the FAA must consider whether other conditions should apply if the limit is raised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the existing conditions is that there be no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle. The 30 passenger
arrangement proposed by Jetstream still complies with this requirement. In fact, the additional seat is located
on the left side of the aisle at the extreme rear of the airplane, and does not produce the same kind of aisle offset that
occurs throughout the cabin. This is because the seat is opposite a windscreen at which point the aisle leads into the
passageway for the aft exit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These special conditions are intended to provide requirements which result in a cabin aisle that is as effective and
safe as those envisioned by the regulations for the maximum number of passengers on the airplane. Where appropriate,
requirements have been drawn from existing regulations. In other cases, new requirements were developed to preserve
the level of safety which is inherent in the design of more conventional aisle arrangements. The FAA considers that
an additional passenger does not invalidate the existing special conditions. It is noted however, that further increase
in passenger capacity would violate one of the other conditions because it would result in more than ten seat rows on
at least one side of the aisle. Therefore, any increase beyond 30 passenger seats would very likely require the development
of additional conditions. As noted above, the FAA has determined that the staggered aisle should limit the passenger
seating capacity to something less than would otherwise be allowed by the regulations. Under the terms of these special
conditions, 30 is considered to be the reasonable maximum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the case of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, an evacuation demonstration would be required for
the 30-passenger version. Since the applicant chose to conduct it with 30 rather than 29 passengers, the evacuation
demonstration conducted for the 29-passenger version would show compliance with this requirement for the 30-passenger
version as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the following amended special conditions are proposed
for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes with a staggered main aisle. Other conditions may be developed as needed
based on further FAA review and discussions with the manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed special conditions would be applicable initially to the 30 passenger version of
the Jetstream Aircraft Limited Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. Should Jetstream apply at a later date for a change
to the type certificate to include another model of the 4100 series incorporating the same novel or unusual design
feature, the special conditions would apply to that model, as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream, in their petition, requested that the amended special conditions be promulgated without delay as a final
rule and in time to permit delivery of 30 passenger airplanes during August 1994. The FAA has determined that public
comment would be in the public interest, but will shorten the comment period to 20 days in order to expedite the issuance
of the final special conditions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter
Corporation Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX
series helicopters, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of a certain main rotor transmission
clutch assembly (clutch assembly) for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil level and, if necessary,
replacement of the clutch assembly. The current AD also requires replacement of the clutch assembly at certain time-in-service
intervals. This action would require the same inspections and replacements as required by the current AD, but would
provide an additional approved replacement part number and provide a reference to three additional manufacturer
service documents. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly,
loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 23, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989),
to require initial and repetitive inspections of certain main rotor transmission clutch assemblies for bearing
roughness, noise, lock-up, and improper oil levels. AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 also requires replacement of the main
rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) when unairworthy, and establishes a 1,200 hours time-in-service
retirement life on the clutch assembly. That action was prompted by several failures of the clutch assembly. Based
on an analysis of the clutch assembly failure data, the FAA, in conjunction with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation
and Formsprag, the clutch assembly manufacturer, determined that the clutch assembly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through &hyph;7), could not be safely overhauled and returned
to service. The FAA has determined that premature failure of the clutch assembly due to a loss of lubricant creates
an unsafe condition. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control
of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved the use of clutch assembly, part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4
(Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10), in addition to the earlier clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag
CL 40526&hyph;8) as replacement clutch assemblies. Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09,
The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) issued Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0069, Revision A, dated
July 9, 1990, that contains an overhaul time interval for clutch assemblies, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag
CL 40526&hyph;8) and P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10). Also, AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 referenced
neither Enstrom Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978, pertaining to checking the run-out
of the main rotor pinion shaft nor Enstrom SDB No. 0068, dated May 8, 1986, subsequently reissued July 9, 1990, pertaining
to the retirement life of the clutch assembly. Finally, a note contained in AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 incorrectly referenced
SIL ``0038A''; the reference should have been SIL ``No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 to require initial and repetitive inspections of
certain clutch assemblies for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil levels and, if necessary, immediate
replacement of the clutch assembly. Owner/operator checks are proposed after engine start and rotor engagement
to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly and, after each engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still turning
down, to check for abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the upper pulley that houses the clutch
assembly. These proposed owner/operator checks do not require the use of tools, precision measuring equipment,
training, pilot logbook endorsements, or the use of technical data not contained in the AD. Additionally, these owner/operator
checks are considered part of the normal pilot ``Before Takeoff'' and ``After Landing'' checks and were allowed by
the existing AD. These owner/operator checks are additional measures to ensure, between 25 hours TIS inspections,
that sufficient lubricants are maintained in the clutch assembly and not lost through a leaking seal. These checks
may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft
records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation
Regulations. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the clutch assembly at certain TIS intervals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 162 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $2,800 to overhaul or $10,500 for a zero-time clutch assembly per helicopter.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be from $471,420,
if only overhauled clutch assemblies are installed, to $1,718,820, if only zero-time clutch assemblies are used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''

Compliance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly), loss of control of the main rotor
system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, 280, and 280C series helicopters, equipped
with clutch assembly part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7) perform
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Before the first flight of each day, before takeoff, gently close the throttle, splitting the tachometer needles
to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly. If the tachometer needles do not split, before further flight,
inspect the clutch assembly in accordance with paragraph (a)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the conclusion of the last flight of each day, after engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still running down,
listen for any abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the area of the upper pulley that houses the
clutch assembly. If any abnormal noise is heard from the clutch assembly, inspect the clutch assembly in accordance
with paragraph (a)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The operational checks required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) may be performed by an owner/operator holding
at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD
in accordance with 14 CFR 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If any irregularities are noted while performing the procedures required by paragraph (1) or (2), inspect the
clutch assembly to determine if it is locked-up, or if the upper pulley will rotate. Rotate it in both directions while
feeling for any bearing roughness and listening for any bearing noise. The upper pulley should free-wheel if rotated
in a clockwise direction and engage if rotated in a counterclockwise direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Within the next 25 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD),
make an entry in the aircraft log book documenting the clutch assembly part number, the number of hours TIS, and the
date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland
GmbH (ECD) Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 series helicopters. This proposal would require a modification of the latches on
the transmission and engine cowlings access doors. This proposal is prompted by five occurrences of an engine or transmission
cowling access door becoming loose in flight. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the
transmission and engine cowling access doors from opening in flight, being struck by the main rotor blade, and subsequently,
separating from the helicopter and being ingested by the main rotor or tail rotor system resulting in a loss of control
of the helicopter.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD), that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland
GmbH (ECD) Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 series helicopters, serial numbers (S/N) 7001 through 7201. Since 1986, there have
been five reports of the engine or transmission cowling access doors opening in flight which, in several cases, resulted
in damage to the main rotor blades. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved MBB-Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin ASB&hyph;MBB&hyph;BK 117&hyph;20&hyph;104,
Revision 1, dated December 8, 1989, that describes procedures for removing and modifying various latches of the access
doors of the transmission and engine cowlings, installing new locks, and providing the cowlings, firewalls, and
fuselage with appropriate mating components. Transmission and engine cowlings that open in flight can damage the
rotor systems and, therefore, create an unsafe condition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other ECD Model MBB&hyph;BK 117
helicopters of the same type design, the proposed AD would require replacing the current latches with those having
positive locks, relocating certain latches, and installing additional locks on the transmission and engine cowling
access doors within the next 150 hours time-in-service. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 126 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
45 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $624 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $390,474. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing to approve Illinois' 1990 base year ozone
precursor emissions inventory for certain ozone nonattainment areas as revisions to the Illinois ozone State Implementation
Plan (SIP). The emissions inventories were submitted by the State of Illinois to satisfy a Federal requirement that
States containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions. The Illinois
ozone nonattainment areas covered by the ozone emissions inventories addressed in this rulemaking are: Chicago,
Metro-East St. Louis, and Jersey County. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision request without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial
revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final
rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated
in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and
the public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. A second comment
period on this action will not be held. Parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time.

As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define
the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permit program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permit programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July
21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop,
and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other
sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant
to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date,
or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.

B. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MPCA's permitting rule, Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007, combines the State's preconstruction and operating permit
programs into a single permitting program. This approval is limited solely to Minnesota's part 70 operating permit
program submittal of November, 15, 1993. This is not a rulemaking under section 110 of the Act. The State has submitted
a separate request for approval of this rule as a preconstruction permitting program and a federally enforceable
state operating permit program as a revision to the State Implementation Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minnesota's submittal includes a statement that the program will be enforceable in the entire State of Minnesota
except Indian tribal lands. Because MPCA has not demonstrated, consistent with applicable principles of Indian
law and Federal Indian policies, legal authority to regulate sources on tribal lands, the proposed interim approval
of Minnesota's operating permits program will not extend to lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation
in the State of Minnesota.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title V sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Minnesota will be subject to either
the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or to a tribal operating permits program
approved pursuant to title V and the regulations that will be promulgated under section 301(d) of the Act. The section
301(d) regulations will authorize EPA to treat tribes in the same manner as States for appropriate Act provisions.

II. Proposed Action and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Support Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, submitted Minnesota's part 70 Operating Permit Rule on November 15, 1993,
requesting source category-limited interim approval of the State's program. The Commissioner of MPCA has the authority
to submit this rule on behalf of the Governor of Minnesota under Minnesota Statutes section 116.03, subdivision 3.
The submittal contained all required elements under 40 CFR 70.4, including a description of Minnesota's operating
permit program, permitting program documentation, and the Attorney General's legal opinion that the laws of the
State of Minnesota provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the program required by the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Regulations and Program Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Minnesota permitting regulations (Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007) substantially meet the requirements of 40
CFR 70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 with respect to permit content including operational flexibility; 40 CFR 70.7 and 70.8 with
respect to permit processing requirements (including public participation and minor permit modifications); and
40 CFR 70.11 with respect to requirements for enforcement authority. The Minnesota permitting regulations meet
the requirements of 40 CFR 70.2 and 70.3 with respect to applicability and 40 CFR 70.5 with respect to criteria which
define insignificant activities and complete application forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minnesota Rules 7007.0100, subpart 26 defines ``Title I modification'' as ``any change that constitutes a modification
under any provision of [T]itle I of the Act.'' In addition, Minnesota's rule specifically includes major modifications
under parts C and D of title I, modifications subject to a New Source Performance Standard, and modifications subject
to a National Emission standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) or any other rules adopted by the Administrator
under section 112 of the Act. Commissioner Charles Williams states in his April 19, 1994, letter that Minnesota interprets
its definition to include modifications made pursuant to a preconstruction permitting program approved into the
State Implementation Plan under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act. The EPA is soliciting comment, as part of the proposal
to revise part 70, on the proper definition of ``Title I modifications.'' However, EPA believes that Minnesota's
definition, in light of this clarification, would be consistent with any definition of ``Title I modifications''
EPA may adopt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further discussion on the State's regulations, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying
this approval. The program submittal meets the program requirements of title V and 40 CFR part 70 except as discussing
in II.B of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Permit Fee Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Minnesota's fee collection rule, Minnesota Rules 7002.0035, sets the minimum amount of funding the State receives
from title V sources by multiplying the number of tons of regulated pollutants listed in the most recent available
emissions inventory, with a maximum of 4,000 tons per pollutant per facility, by $25 + the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
per ton. However, the current definition of regulated pollutant in MPCA's fee rule (Minnesota Rules 7007.0015, subpart
4) does not include particulate matter greater than 10 microns in diameter, total reduced sulfur, hydrogen chloride,
or sulfuric acid mist, all of which are included in the Federal definition. MPCA intends to remedy this discrepancy
in a rulemaking scheduled for 1994. When this discrepancy has been corrected, MPCA's fee rule will set the minimum
funding the State will receive at the presumptive minimum. However, during the first year after interim approval
is granted, the fees that the State of Minnesota will be collecting, which has already been established through the
State's regulations, will result in collection of a dollar per ton amount less than the presumptive minimum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minnesota will collect $6,558,000 in emission fees for the first year of its program, and has demonstrated that the
fees collected will be sufficient to run the program for the first year. However, the fee demonstration in Minnesota's
submittal does not contain all information required by 40 CFR 70.9. Specifically, Minnesota's fee demonstration
does not contain an estimate of permit program costs for the first four years after program approval. Therefore, the
State's fee demonstration may only be given an interim approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for the State to receive full approval of it's program, the State must either change its definition of regulated
air pollutant in its fee rule to include all pollutants included in the Federal definition, or it must submit a four
year projection of costs and fees to be collected that demonstrates that the State will collect fees in an amount sufficient
to run its program.

4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Minnesota has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all
section 112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Minnesota's enabling legislation
and in regulatory provisions defining ``applicable requirements'' and stating that the permit must incorporate
all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow Minnesota to issue
permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Minnesota is able to implement and enforce all section 112
requirements. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying
this rulemaking and the April 13, 1993, guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for section
112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Minnesota is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from
the date of approval of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) or offsets under section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally
enforceable restrictions on a source-specific basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Minnesota's preconstruction
permitting program found in Minnesota Rules Chapter 7007 under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose
of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule
implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes this approval is necessary so that Minnesota has a mechanism
in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval.
Although section 112(l) generally provides authority for approval of State air toxics programs, title V and section
112(g) provide authority for this limited approval because of the direct linkage between implementation of section
112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly limited to section 112(g) and does not confer or imply approval
for purposes of any other provision under the Act, for example section 110. If Minnesota does not wish to implement
section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing
section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving Minnesota's part 70 program, approve the alternative
instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State adopts rules implementing regulations promulgated
by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval to a reasonable
time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Minnesota, acting expeditiously, will be able
to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing here to limit the duration
of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations. Comment is solicited on
whether 18 months is an appropriate period considering Minnesota's procedures for adoption of regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for
approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources.
Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation,
and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing
to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Minnesota's program for receiving delegation of section
112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated. Minnesota has informed EPA that it intends
to accept delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation. The details of this delegation mechanism
will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Minnesota and EPA, expected to be completed prior to approval
of Minnesota's section 112(l) program for delegation of unchanged Federal standards. This program applies to both
existing and future standards, but is limited to sources that will obtain part 70 permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Title IV.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Minnesota's program contains adequate authority to issue permits which reflect the requirements of title IV and
its implementing regulations. In addition, Minnesota's submittal contains a commitment to revise its regulations
as necessary to accommodate Federal revisions and additions to title IV and the Acid Rain regulations once they are
promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permit program submitted by Minnesota on November
15, 1993. If this approval is promulgated, the State must make the following changes to receive full approval: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Remove from the State's legislation Minnesota Statutes section 609.671, subdivision 14 which provides an exemption
from criminal prosecution for sources which give notice of a violation and take reasonable steps to remedy the violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 6 to clearly state that all part 70 sources must submit semi-annual reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.1400 to be consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d). Minnesota Rules 7007.1400
provides that the administrative amendment procedure may be used to ``clarify a permit term.'' This ambiguous provision
is not consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d) and could be interpreted broadly enough to allow changes
to a permit which should be handled through the permit modification procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 to require that the permit terms included in 40 CFR 70.6(a) be expressly
stated in part 70 permits. Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 allows permit terms which are required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)
to be included in the permit by reference to the state regulation. Failure to have these provisions expressly stated
in the permit may create difficulties in enforcing those terms and may make it difficult for citizens to understand
what provisions apply to a source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Revise the definition of regulated pollutant at Minnesota Rules 7002.0035 to include any ``regulated pollutant
for presumptive fee calculation'' as defined at 40 CFR 70.2, or submit a detailed fee demonstration containing all
required elements under 40 CFR 70.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Revise Minn. Rules 7007.0750, subpart 2.C to require the permitting authority to take action on minor and moderate
permit amendments within 90 days of receipt of a complete application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. During the interim approval period,
the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal
permit program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect
to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim
approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Minnesota has requested Source Category-Limited (SCL) interim approval of its part 70 operating permit program.
Although the State would be required to issue permits within 3 years to all sources subject to the program that obtains
interim approval, some sources would not be subject to the requirement to obtain a permit until full approval is granted.
Part 70 sources which are not addressed until full approval are also subject to the 3-year time period for processing
initial permit applications. The 3-year period for these sources would begin on the date full approval of the State's
program is granted. Therefore, initial permitting of all part 70 sources might not be completed until 5 years after
interim approval is granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minnesota has presented the following as compelling reasons for why SCL interim approval should be granted in the
November 15, 1993, submittal:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Minnesota does not have nonattainment areas for ozone. Consequently, Minnesota has not adopted Volatile Organic
Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology rules, nor does it have its own State air toxics rules. Therefore,
MPCA and the facilities regulated by the air toxics program are not familiar with and have not implemented measures
to control VOC emissions. MPCA staff and the regulated community will need additional time to catch up with other States
in becoming familiar with control techniques and to identify and contact VOC/toxic sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Minnesota has a variety of large, complex sources which require extensive amounts of time to permit. The time spent
issuing permits to these sources will take considerable time away from issuing permits to other sources, making it
impossible given MPCA's resource constraints for MPCA to issue permits to all part 70 sources within 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. MPCA expects to lose a portion of its experienced permitting engineers to private industry when facilities are
required to submit permit applications. The time which is necessary to train new staff as this occurs will increase
the amount of time needed to issue a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Although MPCA has almost doubled its staff since January of 1992 in anticipation of the workload associated with
title V, the workload will surpass available resources. MPCA intends to request additional funding during the 1995
legislative session; however, MPCA will still be unable to take final action on all applications within 3 years.

EPA believes Minnesota has presented compelling reasons for a SCL interim approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that a program granted SCL interim approval must apply to at least 60 percent of all part 70 sources,
which are responsible for at least 80 percent of the aggregate emissions from all part 70 sources. The EPA requires
a demonstration that these criteria are met when a significant percentage of sources or aggregate emissions are excluded
from the interim program. The Minnesota submittal which included a schedule for permitting part 70 sources which
would permit 60.71 percent of part 70 sources emitting 81.35 percent of aggregate emissions from part 70 sources within
3 years of program approval met the criteria.d.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that SCL interim approval is warranted for Minnesota's program. For further discussion on EPA's determination,

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis

assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interim approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements
that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal approval of a State operating permit program does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds.

If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable
to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover,
EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this
disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not
remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the mid-1970's, the General Services Administration has imposed rigid building temperature and air circulation
standards in the buildings it owns and manages. These standards were established to promote energy conservation
without appropriate attention to occupant comfort and productivity. The results of a recent survey of GSA's building
occupants showed a low customer satisfaction in the areas of building temperatures and indoor air quality. These
results, plus the introduction of new building energy technologies which provide energy conservation without diminution
of comfort and service to building occupants, allow GSA to eliminate rigid temperature standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule will eliminate operating standards and allow for building temperatures to be maintained in a manner
satisfactory to users and consistent with local commercial practices. In addition, it will delete the minimum ventilation
rate and replace it with the ventilation standards specified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and
Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE Standard 62 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality). This will improve
temperature comfort levels, ventilation, and the indoor air quality of buildings. This will, in turn, improve customer
satisfaction and productivity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12862_Setting Customer Service Standards. Executive Order 12862 states that in order to carry out
the principles of the National Performance Review, the Federal Government must be customer-driven. GSA, in an effort
to become more customer driven, seeks to improve customer satisfaction, by changing regulations that have a direct
effect on three areas of low customer satisfaction. GSA's customers, building tenants, have indicated by their responses
to customer surveys that they have very low satisfaction levels for the following: ventilation, 42 percent satisfied;
indoor air quality, 44 percent satisfied; summer temperature, 53 percent satisfied; and winter temperature, 56
percent satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The two sections of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) addressed in this proposal mandate space
temperatures and ventilation rates that contribute to low customer satisfaction. These changes will permit the
Buildings Managers to control building temperatures and mandate adherence to the latest air ventilation guidelines.
On April 11, 1994 the Administrator of GSA granted a class deviation for the two sections of the FPMR. This action made
the changes recommended in this proposed rule effective immediately for GSA buildings.

 In this document, NHTSA proposes technical amendments to the insurance cost information regulations. Among the
proposed changes are revising the term ``passenger motor vehicles'' to read ``passenger cars, utility vehicles,
light duty trucks, and vans,'' and revising from January to March, the availability date of the insurance information.
NHTSA also proposes making more explicit the limitations of the collision loss data, and proposes recommending that
prospective purchasers contact insurance agents for more information. The technical amendments are proposed to
make the insurance cost information more accurate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Insurance Cost Information Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 32302(c) states that the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) shall prescribe regulations that
require passenger motor vehicle dealers to distribute to prospective purchasers information developed by the Secretary
and provided to the dealer which compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger
motor vehicles based upon differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness. By delegation from the Secretary,
NHTSA has been authorized to carry out the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 31, 1975, NHTSA published 49 CFR part 582, Insurance Cost Information Regulation (40 FR 4918). Part 582,
as then promulgated, required that automobile dealers ``make available to prospective purchasers information
reflecting differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based upon
differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness.'' Part 582, however, did not specify information that
dealers must provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12545), NHTSA published a final rule amending part 582. The rule complemented the 1975 rulemaking,
and completed implementation of section 32302(c). The March 1993 final rule, which became effective April 5, 1993,
requires dealers of new automobiles to make collision loss experience data available in booklets to prospective
purchasers. The information to be provided in the booklet is specified in section 582.5, which requires inclusion
of a complete explanatory text and updated data on auto insurance costs published annually by NHTSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mandatory text specified by part 582 relates to, among other topics, the limitations of the auto insurance cost
data as a predictor of differences in insurance premiums. Essentially, those limitations result from the fact that
most of the factors that insurance companies use to establish premiums relate to driver characteristics and, except
for the vehicle's value, are not directly related to the vehicle itself. Thus, as the text explains, the fact that a
vehicle's historical claims experience is somewhat better or worse than that of other vehicles in its class may not
be reflected in the premium that an insurance company establishes for that vehicle. If the claims experience is reflected,
it is likely to have only a small impact on the premium.

The mandatory text also urges consumers to contact insurance companies if they wish to obtain precise information
about actual premiums for particular makes and models of vehicles. Previous studies by NHTSA have revealed that the
difference between the premiums charged by different insurance companies for the same car and driver is greater than
the difference between the premiums charged by a given company for comparably-valued cars that have different claims
experience. NHTSA believed the mandatory text would help to minimize consumer confusion by providing customers
with an understanding of the uses and limitations of the auto insurance cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In specifying the yearly insurance cost data that accompanied the required text, NHTSA decided to rely on collision
loss experience data collected and reported by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), as the best available indicator
of the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the March 1993 final rule, NHTSA specified HLDI's December Insurance Collision Report as the data source for part
582. NHTSA decided to specify HLDI's December Report because it contains more current data and covers more vehicle
models than other HLDI publications. The HLDI data is presented in a format that ranks the vehicles in each class from
best to worst (with numerical values given for each vehicle). NHTSA specified this format because it determined the
use of this ranking system should assist customers in evaluating the comparative performance of comparable vehicles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the March 1993 final rule, NHTSA stated its belief that the HLDI information should be available as soon as possible
after its publication date. Therefore, NHTSA stated its intent to publish the annual 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document updating HLDI's December Insurance Collision Report data no later than January of the calendar year that
follows HLDI's publication of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this notice of proposed rulemaking, NHTSA proposes to amend part 582 by making certain changes in section 582.5,
that specifies the text of the insurance cost information booklet. At present, the text specifies the date ``January
[Year to be Inserted].'' In this NPRM, NHTSA proposes to revise ``January'' to ``March.'' The change to a later month
will allow NHTSA adequate time to publish the comparative insurance cost information booklet. HLDI sends the December
Insurance Collision Report data to NHTSA in mid-January. The data is then formatted for printing and distributed
to automobile dealers by mail. NHTSA can thus expect that the booklet will be published by March of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 582 presently specifies a comparison of insurance costs for ``passenger motor vehicles.'' In this NPRM, NHTSA
proposes to revise ``passenger motor vehicles,'' at appropriate places in &sect;582.5, to read ``passenger cars,
utility vehicles, light duty trucks and vans.'' The proposed revisions would make clear that ``passenger motor vehicles''
includes many vehicle types besides ``passenger car.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this NPRM, NHTSA also proposes to make certain changes to the required text that would make more explicit the limitations
of the collision loss data. At present, the text in &sect;582.5 explaining the data's limitations states that the
collision loss data table does not include information about new models, models that have been substantially redesigned,
and models without enough claim experience. In order to make clear that certain data should not be relied upon, NHTSA
proposes to revise the third paragraph in &sect;582.5 to state:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED],
and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, the fourth paragraph in &sect;582.5 states that it is unlikely that a consumer's total premium will vary
more than five percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle. Upon further review,
NHTSA believes it would be more accurate to state that it is unlikely that a consumer's total premium will vary more
than ten percent. This notice proposes that change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for the change to ten percent is that the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) recommends insurance premium
rates to its members. An ISO representative indicated to NHTSA that the collision cost data could result in an insurance
premium reduction of ten percent rather than the five percent mentioned in the booklet ``Comparison of Differences
in Insurance Costs for Passenger Motor Vehicles on the Basis of Damage Susceptibility,'' made available to motor
vehicle purchasers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, at present, &sect;582.5 states that to determine the actual premium that a consumer will be charged for insuring
a particular vehicle or for complete information about insurance premiums, the consumer should contact insurance
companies directly. In this proposed rule, NHTSA proposes that &sect;582.5 be revised to advise the consumer to contact
insurance company 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
agents 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
directly. Amending the text to advise the consumer to contact the insurance company agents directly, reflects the
fact that the consumer's first point of contact with insurance companies is the insurance company agent.

Regulatory Impacts

1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking
action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. The agency has determined that the economic effects of the proposed amendments are minimal,
so that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This NPRM proposes minor amendments to the insurance cost information
regulation, so that the information to be provided to potential motor vehicle purchasers is more accurate. Assuming
these proposals are adopted, any extra text that must be included in the information booklet would be minuscule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this notice of proposed rulemaking
on small entities. NHTSA estimates there are about 24,000 dealers of new passenger motor vehicles. Many of the dealers
would be considered small entities, that may be affected by this proposed rule. However, NHTSA believes that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of these small dealers. The rationale
is that this rulemaking proposes minor editorial changes, resulting in a small amount of extra text in the insurance
cost information booklet. The potential cost increments associated with this proposed rule should have negligible
effects on the purchase price of new passenger motor vehicles. For these reasons, I certify that the proposed rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

3. National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts
of this proposed rule and determined that if made final, it will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human
environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12623,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES IN INSURANCE COSTS FOR PASSENGER CARS, UTILITY VEHICLES, LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS, AND VANS ON
THE BASIS OF DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided the information in this booklet in compliance
with Federal law as an aid to consumers considering the purchase of a new vehicle. The booklet compares differences
in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks and vans on the
basis of damage susceptibility. However, it does not indicate a vehicle's relative safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table contains the best available information regarding the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance
premiums. It was taken from data compiled by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) in its December [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Insurance Collision Report, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and reflects the collision loss experience of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks, and vans sold in the
United States in terms of the average loss payment per insured vehicle year for [THREE APPROPRIATE YEARS TO BE INSERTED].
NHTSA has not verified the data in this table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The table represents vehicles' collision loss experience in relative terms, with 100 representing the average for
all passenger vehicles. Thus, a rating of 122 reflects a collision loss experience that is 22 percent higher (worse)
than average, while a rating of 96 reflects a collision loss experience that is 4 percent lower (better) than average.
The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED],
and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although many insurance companies use the HLDI information to adjust the ``base rate'' for the collision portion
of their insurance premiums, the amount of any such adjustment is usually small. It is unlikely that your total premium
will vary more than ten percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you do not purchase collision coverage or your insurance company does not use the HLDI information, your premium
will not vary at all in relation to these rankings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, different insurance companies often charge different premiums for the same driver and vehicle. Therefore,
you should contact insurance company agents directly to determine the actual premium that you will be charged for
insuring a particular vehicle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Please Note
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: In setting insurance premiums, insurance companies mainly rely on factors that are not directly related to the vehicle
itself (except for its value). Rather, they mainly consider driver characteristics (such as age, gender, marital
status, and driving record), the geographic area in which the vehicle is driven, how many miles are traveled, and how
the vehicle is used. Therefore, to obtain complete information about insurance premiums, you should contact insurance
company agents directly.

Insurance companies do not generally adjust their premiums on the basis of data reflecting the crashworthiness of
different vehicles. However, some companies adjust their premiums for personal injury protection and medical payments
coverage if the insured vehicle has features that are likely to improve its crashworthiness, such as air bags and automatic
seat belts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Test data relating to vehicle crashworthiness are available from NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). NCAP
test results demonstrate relative frontal crash protection in new vehicles. Information on vehicles that NHTSA
has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained by calling the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424&hyph;9393.

 The Coast Guard proposes to revise regulations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. commercial fishing industry vessels subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aleutian Trade Act (ATA) of 1990. This proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgate a new subpart regulating certain equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and operating procedures for fish tender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would allow for the continued cargo service by water to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remote communities in Alaska while ensuring increased safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for the vessels engaged in this trade.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 19, 1990, the Coast Guard published a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for Commercial Fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry Vessels (55 FR 14924). In the NPRM, the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard proposed to regulate U.S. documented or state numbered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uninspected fishing, fish processing, and fish tender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, including vessels engaged in the Aleutian Trade, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the provisions of the Commercial Fishing Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessel Safety Act of 1988. Subsequent to the NPRM, Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted the Aleutian Trade Act of 1990 (ATA), significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the impact of the proposed regulations on vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in the Aleutian trade. The ATA provides for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued cargo service to remote communities in Alaska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while ensuring increased safety standards for fish tender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. As a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking, (SNPRM), in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 27, 1992 (57 FR 48670). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the SNPRM, the Coast Guard received over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
206 comments specifically opposing, and only 4 comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favoring, the proposed ATA regulations. In a second SNPRM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Coast Guard is now proposing to increase the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for these vessels consistent with the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received to the first SNPRM and establish a separate subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 46 CFR Part 28 for vessels engaged in the Aleutian trade.

The Aleutian Trade Act of 1990. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1990, the President signed Pub. L. 101&hyph;595, The Aleutian Trade Act of 1990 (``the ATA''). The
ATA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies only to fish tender vessels engaged in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of cargo (including fishery related products) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hire to or from a place in Alaska west of 153
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; West 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longitude and east of 172
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; East longitude and only, if that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place receives weekly common carrier service by water, to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a place in the United States (except a place in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska). The ATA requires these fish tender vessels to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new safety and manning standards over a specified period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. Additional background information concerning the ATA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Coast Guard's interpretation of the Act, may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found at page 48670 of the SNPRM published October 27, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the SNPRM of October 27, 1992, the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard received four comments supporting the ATA. They were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a common carrier, a ship yard, a naval architect and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested party that did not identify its affiliation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Coast Guard received 206 comments opposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ATA. These comments were from fishermen, fishing vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies, naval architects, shipyards, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legislature and Governor of Alaska, an insurance company, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary objections to the proposed requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were: (1) The potential for severe economic hardship to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of ATA vessels, and the people and companies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels serve in the outlying areas; (2) the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that common carriers serving the Aleutian area would have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monopoly on seaborne commerce in this area and could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly increases rates; and (3) the lack of need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional regulations when considering the positive safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record of ATA vessels. Additionally, comments opposed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rules by arguing that: (1) The Coast Guard greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underestimated the cost of compliance; (2) the Commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act states that the Coast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guard cannot require alterations to existing vessels; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the standards proposed are excessive and greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those required of an inspected cargo vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the large number of comments opposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first SNPRM, the Coast Guard will revise its proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and issue a second SNPRM. The Coast Guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes this SNPRM proposes standards that would upgrade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety requirements aboard ATA vessels and yet be responsive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the comments received to the first SNPRM. In this SNPRM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Coast Guard is proposing a new subpart G, to be entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aleutian Trade Act Vessels. Each section is summarized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 28.040&blank;Incorporation by Reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section lists the industry standards that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference and the corresponding sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where each standard is reference as the governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of keeping the regulations as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncomplicated as possible, the number of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference has been minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 28.800&blank;Applicability and General Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the revised applicability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA vessels proposed for this subpart. Fish tender vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in the Aleutian trade are subject to inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), or (7) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except those that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are not more than 500 gross tons; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Have an incline test performed by a marine surveyor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Have written stability instructions posted on board the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 28.805&blank;Launching of Survival Craft
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require ATA vessels to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46 CFR subpart B, which requires inflatable liferafts (SOLAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Packs) for 100% complement coverage. To facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual launching of survival craft which have a mass of more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 110 pounds, (50 kg), each vessel must have a gate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another opening in its bulwarks, deck rails, or lifelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would adopt the same requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart D, which are essentially identical to those found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subchapter I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 28.815&blank;Bilge Pumps, Bilge Piping, and Dewatering Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require two power bilge pumps, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a separate source of power (e.g. one electric pump and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one mechanically driven or power take-off (PTO) pump) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connected to a fixed system. However, a portable powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pump could substitute for one of the required pumps as long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it meets specific criteria as promulgated in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. In contrast, subpart D requires one powered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilge pump connected to a fixed system while subchapter I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires three powered pumps for cargo vessels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require one power driven fire pump, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connected to fixed piping, capable of delivering water at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum of 50 gallons per minute. In addition, a portable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pump must be carried that has a capacity of 9500 gallons per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour and is capable of being connected to the firemain and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoses. However, if the vessel already has a portable pump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfying the second bilge pump requirement, no additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable pump would be required as long as it is properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped to handle both firefighting and flood control.

provides acceptance latitude. It would require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodation spaces to be fitted with modular smoke

detectors, and require manual remote shutdown of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of subchapter F for any replacement and or alteration to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing grandfathered piping. It would also add the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for remote shutoff valves on certain fuel tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metal shields under filters, and limits the length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonmetallic flexible hose used (for vibration purposes

Some of the piping aboard ex-Navy yard oilers

used in the Aleutian trade was built and installed to Navy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications and was encased in cement ballast. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement would be grandfathered. In contrast, subpart D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires all fuel lines to be constructed of seamless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material only, except short lengths of flex hose for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vibration. Cargo vessels have the same requirements and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additionally, all valves and fittings must meet specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations of subchapter F.

standards such as Underwriters Laboratory (UL). An added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grandfathering clause would allow acceptance of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials and installations, on a case by case basis. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, existing cables and wiring runs could be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain as presently constructed and routed. However, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement wiring or new installations would have to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific requirements. In comparison, the installation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all electrical systems and interior communications as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, construction, and material acceptance for cargo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels must be done in accordance with subchapter J.

This section requires that a distribution system which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has neutral bus or conductor have the neutral bus or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conductor grounded. It also requires a grounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution system to have only one connection to ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The one connection to ground must be at the switchboard, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a nonmetallic vessel at the common ground point.

Section 28.860&blank;Overcurrent Protection and Switched Circuits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require the same standards found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart D, which are similar to the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected vessels contained in 46 CFR subchapter J_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 28.865&blank;Wiring Methods and Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require the same standards for wires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conductors found in subpart D.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 28.870&blank;Emergency Source of Electrical Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require an emergency source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical power which is capable of supplying connected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loads for at least 3 hours and which is physically separated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the main machinery space. This segregation would help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that one casualty did not disable all sources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical power. If the source is a battery, specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations would have to be satisfied. Note: No emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generator is required_it is believed the combination of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duty engineer and back-up fire &amp; bilge pumps as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional powered portable pump should be sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart D requires an independent source of electrical power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located outside the machinery space capable of supplying all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loads listed above plus the steering gear, and fire &amp; bilge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pumps continuously for 3 hours. Cargo vessels require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency lighting for 6 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would adopt the equipment requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart D for radar and depth sounding devices. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, procedures would be proposed for the use of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auto-pilot.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 28.880&blank;Hydraulic Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would grandfather some existing hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hose runs and materials. It provides specifics for fluid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hose, fittings, and compatibility for use. It adds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for fail-safe system components and provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that enhance operator safety. It reduces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing overuse of nonmetallic hydraulic flex hose by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting its use in runs where flexibility is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically required. However, any retrofit of hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoses would have to be accomplished over a period of time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as replacing the flex hose with hard piping only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever renewals, replacements or alterations are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished. In comparison, subpart D specifically limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allowable length of nonmetallic flexible hose to 30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while subchapter I requires specific material approval in

Section 28.890&blank;Examination and Certification of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require that each ATA vessel be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined for compliance once every two years. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination would be performed by the American Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shipping (ABS), a similarly qualified organization, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another accepted organization. The organization performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the examination would be required to provide the owner and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cognizant Coast Guard District Commander, (Attention: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing Vessel Safety Coordinator) with a copy of the signed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification letter if the vessel was found to be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. A copy of a certification letter would also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be maintained on board the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the inspection provisions, 46 U.S.C. 3302(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was amended by exempting fishing, fish processing, and fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tender vessels of not more than 500 gross tons from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration as a freight vessel, a seagoing barge, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seagoing motor vessel under 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), and (7) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if, when the vessel transports cargo to or from Alaska, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place does not receive weekly common carrier service by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water from a place in the United States; or the cargo is of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a type not accepted by that common carrier service; or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of a fish tender vessel, the vessel is not engaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Aleutian trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not subject to inspection under the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3301 (1), (6), and (7), if the vessel is not more than 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross tons, has an incline test performed by a marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor, and has written stability instructions posted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
board. These provisions were effective May 16, 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed section would require each ATA vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which undergoes a major conversion completed after July 27, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990, to be classed by the ABS or another organization

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would require that a fish tender vessel of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not more than 500 gross tons, engaged in the Aleutian trade, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain a loadline certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 28.905&blank;Post Accident Inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed section was suggested by a common carrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the first SNPRM to require that an ATA vessel undergo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a general or partial survey by a Coast Guard Representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following an accident or if a defect is discovered which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affects the safety of the vessel. This requirement would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to that found in subchapter I for cargo vessels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however a third party would be conducting this post accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 28.910&blank;Repairs and Alterations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed section, again suggested during the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNPRM, would require the managing operators of an ATA vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to notify a Coast Guard Representative prior to making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repairs or alterations to an ATA vessel that may affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 28.915&blank;Manning and Crew 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed section would establish manning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for a fish tender vessel of not more than 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross tons, engaged in the Aleutian trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also proposes that machinery spaces be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the control, when at sea, of an engineer designated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in charge. This designation may be: (a) In writing by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner, operator, or master; (b) by an entry in the ship's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
log if one is maintained; or (c) by a designation on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency instructions required under &sect;28.265. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated engineers are not part of the vessel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complement, then all the requirements of subpart D would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to be met in addition to this subpart. Any component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or system on a vessel found to be in conflict between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations found in subparts D and G, then the higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard will apply. ATA amended 46 U.S.C. 8702 to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the crew requirements set out in &sect;8702, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed the percentage of the deck crew, who are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have merchant mariners documents endorsed for a rating of at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least able seaman, to be reduced from 65 to 50 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crew size. These provisions were effective November 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the ATA amended 46 U.S.C. Chapter 73 to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance of service on an ATA vessel to be used by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to qualify for an endorsement as an ``able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seaman_fishing industry'', ``able seaman_unlimited'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``able seaman_special.'' If the service is on board a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel of at least 100 gross tons, the service may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted to qualify as an ``able seaman_limited''.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard estimates that only 20 vessels out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an estimated U.S. commercial fishing fleet in excess of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
120,000 vessels would be affected by this rule. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule includes a number of grandfathered provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Coast Guard believes that existing equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onboard these 20 vessels should be upgraded and replaced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only when the existing equipment is no longer serviceable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include: (1) Small businesses and not-for-profit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations that are independently owned and operated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not dominant in their fields; and (2) governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An estimated 20 commercial fishing industry vessels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in the Aleutian Trade Act. A number of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels are owned or operated by small entities. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Coast Guard estimates that the cost of complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these revised proposed regulations will be minor. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, you think that your business qualifies as a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity and that this proposal will have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on your business, please submit a comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

will economically affect your business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment. This notice proposes regulations for ATA vessels only. Since this rule affects specific
vessels both inside and outside state waters, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same
subject matter.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of
Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
These proposed rules are to enhance certain safety equipment requirements and general operating procedures of ATA
vessels and have no significant effect on the environment. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the survival craft requirements in subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B of this part, each vessel must have a gate or other opening in the deck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rails, lifelines, or bulwarks adjacent to the stowage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of each survival craft which has a mass of more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110 pounds (50 KG), so that the survival craft can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manually launched.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, deck rails, lifelines, grab rails, or equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection must be installed near the periphery of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weather decks accessible to individuals. Where space 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations make deck rails impractical, hand grabs may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The height of deck rails, lifelines, or bulwarks must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be at least 391/2 inches (1 meter) from the deck, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where this height would interfere with the normal operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the vessel, a lesser height may be substituted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All deck rails or lifelines must be permanently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported by stanchions at intervals of not more than 7 feet (2.3 meters). Stanchions must be through bolted or welded
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Portable stanchions and lifelines may be installed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations where permanently installed deck rails would impede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal cargo operations or emergency recovery operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Deck rails or lifelines must consist of evenly spaced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses. The spacing between courses must not be greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 15 inches (0.38 meters). The opening below the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course must not be more than 9 inches (0.23 meters). Lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses are not required where all or part of the space below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the upper rail is fitted with a bulwark, chain link fencing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wire mesh, or an equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A suitable storm rail or hand grab must be installed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where necessary in a passageway, at a deckhouse side, at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ladder, and a hatch where an individual might have access.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Instead of &sect;28.255, each vessel to which this subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies must meet the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Each vessel must be equipped with a fixed, self 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priming, powered, bilge pump connected to a bilge manifold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and piping capable of draining any watertight compartment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than tanks and small buoyancy compartments, under all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service conditions. Large spaces, such as engine rooms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cargo holds, must be fitted with more than one suction line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In addition, each vessel must be fitted with a fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second, or back-up bilge pump having an independent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate source of power from the pump required in paragraph (a) of this section. One of the bilge pumps may be attached
to the propelling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A portable bilge pump may substitute for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary pump required above, as long as it is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Self priming and provided with a suitable suction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hose of adequate length to reach the bilges of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
watertight compartment it must serve and is fitted with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in check valve and strainer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Fitted with a discharge hose of adequate length to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure overboard discharge. A portable pump must be capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dewatering each space it serves at a rate of at least 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inches (51 millimeters) of water depth per minute; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each hydraulic system must be so designed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed that proper operation of the system is not affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by back pressure in the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Piping and piping components must be designed with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burst pressure of not less than four times the system's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum operating pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each hydraulic system must be equipped with at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one pressure relieving device set to relieve at the system's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum operating pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All material in a hydraulic system must be suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use with the hydraulic fluid used and must be of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical and physical properties as to remain ductile at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowest operating temperature likely to be encountered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except for hydraulic steering equipment, controls for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydraulic equipment must be located where the operator has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unobstructed view of the hydraulic equipment and the adjacent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working area. Protection shall be afforded to the operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hydraulic equipment against falling or swinging objects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or cargo. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Controls for hydraulic equipment must be so arranged

(g) Hydraulically operated machinery must be fail-safe or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with a holding device to prevent uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
movement or sudden loss of control due to loss of hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system pressure. A system is considered to be fail-safe if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component failure will result in a slow and controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release of the load so as not to endanger personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Nonmetallic flexible hose assemblies must only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used between two points of relative motion, limited to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least amount of length that would afford maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multidirectional movement of the equipment served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Hose end fittings must comply with SAE J1475,

(k) Existing hydraulic piping, nonmetallic hose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies, and components may be continued in service so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as they are maintained in good condition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of the Coast Guard Representative, but all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installations, or replacements shall meet the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications or requirements of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lift, excluding the weight of the gear itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All wire rope, chains, rings, hooks, links, shackles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swivels, blocks and any other loose gear used or intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in cargo loading or unloading must be commensurable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the SWL rating in paragraph (a) of this section. This gear shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visually inspected by the vessel's captain or his designee at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent intervals, and in any event not less than once in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each operating month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition to the inspection required in paragraph (b) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a biennial thorough examination and proof load test, at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum of the SWL rating, shall be performed and witnessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by competent personnel. The proof load applied to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winches, booms, derricks, cranes and all associated gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be lifted with the ship's normal tackle with the boom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or derrick at the lowest practicable angle. When the load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been lifted, it shall be swung as far as possible in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) After satisfactory completion of the tests and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all results and notations together with the date
and location of each shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be maintained and available to Coast Guard representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Indians, as defined in the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934, receive employment preference in appointments
in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The preference conferred in 25 U.S.C. 472 must be applied in the filling of every vacant
position within the Bureau of Indian Affairs,

, 499 F.2d 492 (DC Cir. 1974). The Secretary issued a final rule for the definition of ``Indian'' on January 17, 1978.
A fifth criterion applied to the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma and to the Osage Tribe whose rolls were closed by
Acts of Congress and who had not as yet reorganized so as to establish current membership standards. Many such persons
have received preference based on the one-quarter degree standard previously established by the Secretary. In order
that they would not be deprived of that eligibility and made to meet the one-half degree standard, in 1978, the tribes
were allowed 3 years, until July 17, 1981, in which to establish membership standards. Almost 13 years later, the Osage
Tribe is the only remaining tribe that has not organized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complexities of the Osage's unique history have been described in the litigation surrounding the organization
of the tribe and the authority of the Tribal Council. See

affirmed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 640 F.2d 269 (10th Cir. 1981). It is apparent that the Osages have a uniquely difficult task in organizing, since they
are the only tribe which is excluded from organizing under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act and the
Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. Also, the Secretary's regulations under the 1906 Osage Allotment Act permit only Osage
headright holders to vote for the tribal council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 4, 1984, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a final rule (49 FR 39157) to amend 25 CFR Part 5, Preference
in Employment. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 specified the date of October 4, 1985, as the final date for making appointments
of persons of one-quarter degree Indian ancestry. On September 15, 1986, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a
final rule (51 FR 32632) to revise 25 CFR Part 5, Preference in Employment. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 of this part specified
the date of September 15, 1988, as the final date for making appointments of persons of one-quarter degree Indian ancestry.
The last final rule published (54 FR 282, January 5, 1989), extended Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 to January 5, 1990.
Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 has expired and should be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Osage Tribal persons who are employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and who received preference in any previous appointment
will continue to be preference eligible so long as they are continuously employed. However, Osage tribal members
who are seeking Federal employment must now meet category (c) of &sect;5.1 of this part.

This is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order

Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). This rule involves potential Osage Tribal members only, who would be seeking
Federal employment in the BIA. There is no other tribe affected. The information collection requirements contained
in this rule do not require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the locations identified in the

<DOCTITLE>Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Office Complex at Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Prince George's
County, MD</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has prepared
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for construction of a 350,000 square foot, low-rise office complex
plus associated parking on federal land within the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Prince George's County,
Maryland. The project provides for consolidation of USDA functions currently located in leased facilities in Maryland
and the District of Columbia, and in the USDA Headquarters South Building, which will be renovated. Since initiating
the EIS process with a public scoping meeting in January, 1994, the size of the proposed office complex has been decreased
by USDA from 700,000 s.f. to 350,000 s.f.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS considers environmental impacts from project implementation on each of three (3) possible government-owned
sites: Site A, 100
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 acres north of the Capital Beltway, southeast of the Rhode Island Avenue/Sunnyside Avenue intersection; Site B,
120
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 acres east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, southeast of the Powdermill Road/Soil Conservation Service Road
intersection; and Site D, 94
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 acres southeast of the Edmonston Road/Beaverdam Road intersection. A ``No Action'' alternative is also considered.
Potential environmental impacts include short-term construction-related impacts, and long-term changes in traffic,
socio-economic and physical conditions. The Draft EIS is available for inspection at the Beltsville, Greenbelt,
and College Park Public Libraries, and upon request from the USDA Headquarters at the address given below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Public Hearing on the Draft EIS will be held on October 27, 1994, at 7:00 p.m. in the auditorium of the Beltsville Agricultural
Research Center, Building 003, 10300 Baltimore Avenue, Beltsville, Maryland 20705. A short presentation by USDA
summarizing the Draft EIS will precede a period for public comments. Oral comments should be limited to ten (10) minutes
each. Agencies and the public are invited to provide written comments on the Draft EIS, in addition to, or in lieu of,
oral comments at the Public Hearing. All written comments must be mailed, no later than October 27, 1994 to: Mr. Michael
V. Sazonov, Contracting Office Technical Representative, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Operations,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Burgess Community Flood Prevention RC&amp;D Measure is a federally assisted action authorized for planning
under Public Law 97&hyph;98, Agriculture and Food Act of 1981. An environmental assessment was undertaken in conjunction
with the development of the plan. This assessment was conducted in consultation with local, State, and Federal agencies
as well as with interested organizations and individuals. Data developed during the assessment are available for
public review at the following location:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommended Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed is the construction of the Burgess Community Flood Prevention Measure consisting of four miles of new and/or
renovated channels in order to properly remove the stormwater from the residential areas of the watershed. The proposed
measure plan will reduce flooding around 113 homes and reduce flooding of roads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effect of Recommended Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action will protect the private and public improvements within the watershed by improving the removal
of excess stormwater. The channels which will be constructed or modified will be designed to remove the 10 year frequency
storm event. Streamflow will be stabilized to the extent that peak flood flow rates will be slightly reduced and flow
will be attenuated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will impact 0.76 acres of wetlands. The channels depths will be designed from 0.0 feet to a maximum depth
of 5.0 feet. This design will permit out of bank flow while minimizing any hydrological change to the surrounding wetlands.
All spoil and debris will be removed from the wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be a land use change of approximately 15 acres. These changes are a result of land clearing to accommodate
easements and channel location. The change is from forested to open vegetated maintenance road adjacent to the channel.
A vegetated plan will be developed by the SCS biologist in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed project will improve quality of life and improve the health of the community. The removal of ponded stormwater
will allow the septic systems to work more effectively, improving the surface and groundwater quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An initial management survey of cultural resources concluded that no significant adverse impacts will occur to cultural
resources in the project area. SCS archaeologist will conduct a complete survey of the project area prior to the commencement
of any project component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Threatened and endangered plant species have been identified in the project area in recent history but will not be
impacted by the proposed project. SCS in consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the proposed
project as planned will not adversely affect federally listed or proposed endangered and threatened species in Phase
I. Field investigations have not revealed any endangered species in Phase II or III due to other habitat changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fish and wildlife habitats will be temporarily disturbed during the installation of the project. The project will
provide long-term benefits by providing diversity in landuse by creating open space, wildlife plantings, and improved
water quality.

No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installations, with the exception of minor inconveniences
to local residents during construction.

Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The measure plan consisted of three alternatives, the no action plan, construction of 4 miles of channels, and the
removal of all residents from the flood area. Alternative 2, the construction and modification of the channels, was
chosen as the best economical and cost effective solution. Alternative No. 2 has been modified three times to avoid
possible endangered species habitat and wetlands at the request of those agencies involved in the comment processes.

Consultation_Public Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for
Federal Assistance in April 1992. Agencies were again notified when planning was authorized in August 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping meetings were conducted with SCS staff and included representatives from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, South Carolina Department
of Health and Environmental Control, and South Carolina Coastal Council. Meetings were held during April 1992, September
1992, June 1993, and September 1993. Planning involved all agencies identified and included county government and
landowners within the project area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific consultation was conducted with the state Historic Preservation officer and residents within the watershed
as to cultural and historical resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The measure plan was transmitted to all participating and interested agencies, groups, and individuals for review
and comments in January 1994. Public meeting with landowners and sponsors were held throughout the planning process
to keep all interested parties informed of the study progress and to obtain public input to the measure plan and environmental
evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency consultation and public participation to date has shown no unresolved conflicts with the implementation
of the selected plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local,
regional, or national impacts on the environment. Therefore based on the above findings, I have determined that an
environmental impact statement for the Burgess Community Flood Prevention Measure is not required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The record system, identified as CIA&hyph;72, is to be entitled: Inspector General Investigative Records. CIA&hyph;72
has been updated and expanded to include appropriate portions of a system of records entitled ``Employee Grievance
Files'' (CIA&hyph;15), which is hereby being eliminated as a CIA record system, pursuant to the provisions of the
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Accordingly, CIA&hyph;15 (as initially published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 28 August 1975 and subsequently in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Privacy Act Issuances Compilations, Volume IV, the latest of which was published in 1991, and in an upcoming 1993 compilation)
is to be deleted from the listing of CIA Privacy Act systems of records. Because changes and additions have been made
throughout amended CIA&hyph;72, as published in the

Amended Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 733(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on July 28, 1994, the Department of
Commerce (the Department) made its preliminary determination that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Italy was being
sold at less than fair value (59 FR 39736, August 4, 1994). On August 3 and 4, 1994, we disclosed the calculations performed
in our preliminary determination to counsel for respondent Acciaierie Valbruna S.r.l. (Valbruna) and petitioners,
respectively, pursuant to their requests. On August 10, 1994, and August 11, 1994, we received timely submissions
from Valbruna and petitioners, respectively, alleging ministerial errors in the Department's preliminary determination
calculations. (For specific details of these allegations and our analysis of them, see Memorandum from David L. Binder
to Richard W. Moreland dated August 29, 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent claimed that the Department: (1) Incorrectly added to the home market gross unit prices certain freight
charges associated with one of their warehouses that should have been deducted; (2) did not convert home market indirect
selling expenses and commissions to the appropriate unit of measure in its margin analysis; and (3) incorrectly calculated
the impact of the value added tax (VAT) on the home market indirect selling expense offset (ESP offset) by adding the
VAT adjustment relevant to the ESP offset to FMV, rather than deducting it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners claimed that the Department: (1) Incorrectly calculated a differences-in-merchandise (difmer) adjustment
for U.S. sales with identical home market product matches; (2) incorrectly added the home market freight expenses
associated with one of Valbruna's warehouses to the home market gross unit prices in testing whether Valbruna's related
party sales prices were at arm's-length; (3) did not convert home market indirect selling expenses and commissions
to the appropriate unit of measurement in calculating the commission offset and ESP offset caps; and (4) incorrectly
calculated the VAT tax impact on ESP sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that the errors alleged by the parties are ministerial errors. These errors, taken together, will constitute
a significant ministerial error within the meaning of the Department's proposed regulation regarding preliminary
determinations, in that their correction will result in a difference between a dumping margin of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and a margin of greater than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section 353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations (57 FR 1131, January 10, 1992); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See also Correction of Ministerial Errors in Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Sillcomanganese from
Ukraine, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 37969, July 26, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with the procedures set forth in that proposed regulations, we
are amending Valbruna's preliminary dumping margin. The corrected dumping margin for Valbruna is 0.44 percent and
that for ``All Others'' is 6.13 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Suspension of Liquidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are directing Customs Service to correct our request to suspend liquidation, made in accordance with section 733(d)(1)
of the Act, for all entries of SSB from Italy. We are directing the Customs Service to discontinue suspension of liquidation
of all entries of SSB from Italy for Valbruna that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
August 4, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because Valbruna's dumping margin is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
margins are not included within the all other rate, we are directing the Customs Service to correct the All Others rate
so that it will only reflect the rate for Foroni S.p.A., the only other company investigated. We are instructing the
U.S. Customs Service that any cash deposits or bonds collected with respect to SSB from Italy for Valbruna should be
released or refunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation
of all entries of SSB from Italy for Foroni S.p.A. and All Others that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after August 4, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the revised estimated preliminary
dumping margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:

Amended Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 733(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on July 28, 1994, the Department of
Commerce (the Department) made its preliminary determination that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Spain was being
sold at less than fair value (59 FR 39740, August 4, 1994). On August 4, 1994, we disclosed the calculations performed
in our preliminary determination to counsel for respondent Roldan, S.A. (Roldan), and petitioners, pursuant to
their requests. On August 8, 1994, and August 11, 1994, we received submissions from Roldan and petitioners, respectively,
alleging a ministerial error in the Department's preliminary determination calculation. Both parties alleged
that the Department did not convert the unit prices for marine insurance expenses incurred on U.S. sales from Spanish
pesetas to U.S. dollars for purposes of calculating its preliminary antidumping duty margins. The Department subsequently
determined that a ministerial error did not occur when it performed its margin calculation. (For specific details
of this allegation and our analysis, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford dated August 15,
1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 23, 1994, Roldan requested that the Department reconsider its decision that it did not make a ministerial
error in its handling of marine insurance for the preliminary determination, and therefore correct the preliminary
determination. We have reconsidered our earlier decision and now conclude that we made a ministerial error when calculating
the preliminary margin. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford dated August 31, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This error constitutes a significant ministerial error within the meaning of the Department's proposed regulation
regarding preliminary determinations, in that its correction will result in a difference of no less than 5 absolute
percentage points, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
between a dumping margin of 25.21 percent and a dumping margin of 1.92 percent. Therefore, we are amending Roldan's
preliminary dumping margin. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section 353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations (57 FR 1131, January 10, 1992). We have converted
the unit prices for marine insurance expenses from Spanish pesetas to U.S. dollars for purposes of deducting the movement
expense from U.S. price and for purposes of making the VAT adjustment. The corrected dumping margins are 1.92 percent
for Roldan and 4.68 percent for ``all others.''

Suspension of Liquidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are directing the Customs Service to correct our request to suspend liquidation in accordance with section 733(d)(1)
of the Act, for all entries of SSB from Spain for Roldan and for ``all others''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation
of all entries of SSB from Spain that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 4,
1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

dumping margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:

The instrument will be used in determining the three-dimensional structures of proteins and nucleic acids using
x-ray crystallography. The proteins or nucleic acids are crystallized and the single crystals are exposed to a beam
of X-rays which diffracted by the crystals give rise to discreet spots of varying intensities. The instrument is used
to automatically measure the intensities of each of these diffracted reflections and write them out on disk. In addition,
the instrument will be used for Ph.D. thesis research of graduate students in the Department of Molecular Biophysics
and Biochemistry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 156 of title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 22, 1994, Eli Lilly and Company, on behalf of the patent owner Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, filed an application
under 35 U.S.C. section 156(d)(5) for interim extension of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,048,306. The application
states that the patent claims the active ingredient Dirithromycin in the human drug product Dynabac and a method of
using the product under regulatory review. The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing a
regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market or use the product commercially.
The original term of the patent is set to expire on September 13, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the
term of the patent for a period of one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. section 156. Since it is apparent that the
regulatory review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the
patent term under 35 U.S.C. section 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C.
section 156(d)(5) of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,048,306 has been granted for a period of one year from the original
expiration date of the patent.

and the Lao People's Democratic Republic; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March
3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on October 1, 1994, entry into the Customs territory of
the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption
and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk-blend, and non-cotton vegetable
fiber textiles and textile products in Categories 200-239, 300-369, 400-469, 600-670, and 800-899, including merged
and part categories, produced or manufactured in the Lao People's Democratic Republic and exported from the Lao People's
Democratic Republic on and after October 1, 1994 for which the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic
has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below. Should additional categories, merged categories
or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included
in the coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period October 1, 1994 through
October 15, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking
in blue ink will appear on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate
copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into
the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each visa stamp shall include the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical
digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for the Lao People's Democratic Republic is ``LA''), and a six digit
numerical serial number identifying the shipment; e.g., 4LA123456.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The signature and the printed name of the issuing official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment
as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation (e.g., ``Cat. 340&hyph;510 DOZ'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise
may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the
actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise,
the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature,
printed name of signer, category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been
crossed out or altered in any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall
not be permitted. If the quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and
only the amount entered shall be charged to any applicable quota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered
by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic,
or a visa waiver may be issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the request of the Government of Lao People's Democratic
Republic, and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver,
if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct
category limit. If a shipment from Laos has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an
incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to
the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked
commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facsimile of the visa stamp is enclosed with this letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions taken concerning the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic with respect to imports of textiles
and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of
Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the
Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs
exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the

Howard A. Hanson Dam was originally authorized as the Eagle Gorge Dam and Reservoir by the Flood Control Act of 1950.
Construction was completed in 1962. Project authorized purposes were flood control, augmentation of low flows,
irrigation and water supply. Irrigation in the Green River Valley is no longer a priority and the project has never
been operated for water supply. Howard Hanson Dam has arrange of operational choices within the parameters of the
authorized uses of the project. Throughout the years that HHD has been in operation, many downstream changes have
occurred in land use, recreation, k fishery resources and resource allocation as well as in general environmental
awareness. These, in turn, have resulted in operational changes and adjustments primarily related to refilling
the conservation pool and controlling sediment accumulation in the reservoir. Seattle District proposes to operate
the project for flood control and low flow augmentation in accordance with a refill strategy instituted in 1992, a
drought year. In coordination with resource agencies, refill will begin early (April) and discharge flows are designed
to minimize impacts to wild steelhead spawning downstream. This strategy is dynamic and adjustments will be made
on a year-to-year basis as new knowledge is gained.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public involvement will be sought during scoping and conduct of the study in accordance with NEPA procedures. A public
scoping process has been begun to clarify issues of major concern, identify any information sources that might be
available to analyze and evaluate impacts, and obtain public input on the range and acceptability of alternatives.
The Notice of Intent formally commences the scoping process under NEPA. As part of the scoping process, all affected
Federal, State and local agencies, Indian Tribes, and other interested private organizations, including environmental
groups, are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. Comments are requested concerning project alternatives, mitigation
measures, probable significant environmental impacts and permits or other approvals that may be required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy (DOE) is funding a methodological study on nonuse values. A nonuse value is a measure of people's
willingness to pay to preserve the mere existence of something even though they never plan to own, use, or directly
benefit from it. The first portion of the study addreses whether such values exist for nonenvironmental services,
such as jobs of others outside one's community. In the second portion of the study, willingness-to-pay for single
items considered individually will be compared to willingness-to-pay for the same items when bundled. These methodological
questions will be evaluated in a trade-off context, with the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest as the subject
of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This study is being performed solely to address methodological issues surrounding the estimation of nonuse values
and will not be used for any other purpose. In particular, DOE seeks to ascertain whether individuals who state positive
nonuse values for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
environmental 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
services also state positive nonuse values for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
nonenvironmental 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
services and how different survey methods perform to elicit willingness-to-pay valuations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method used here will be a paper-and-pencil survey administered in a shopping mall in or near Raleigh, North Carolina.
Recruiters will approach shoppers and ask if they are willing to take the survey. It will take approximately one-half
hour for each of the anticipated 200 respondents to complete the questionnaire, for a total information collection
burden of 100 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE recognizes that the use of the mall-intercept approach which is necessitated by the Department's limited resources
for this research entails statistical problems that render problematic any extrapolation of survey results to a
population or subpopulation other than the actual individuals sampled. Thus, the results of this survey will be used
solely to guide future research and advance the development of methods for estimating nonuse values, and will not
be used for policy purposes related to any rulemaking, natural resource damage assessment, or other substantive
government program. DOE believes that the practical utility of this research justifies the small burdens it imposes
on respondents.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart
B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

Evcon filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated May 11, 1994, in accordance with section 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. The
Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 14, 1994, Evcon's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 59 FR 35916.
Evcon also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on July 9, 1994.
59 FR 35916, July 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Evcon Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Evcon.

Assertions and Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Evcon's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Evcon requests the allowance to test using a 30-second
blower time delay when testing its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces. Evcon states that since the 30-second delay
is indicative of how these models actually operate and since such a delay results in a 1.0 to 2.0 percent improvement
in overall energy efficiency, the petition should be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Evcon indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these
exceptions for its AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the blower controls incorporated on the Evcon furnaces are designed to impose a 30-second blower delay in every
instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees
that a waiver should be granted to allow the 30-second blower time delay when testing the Evcon AGU, BGU, and BGD series
gas furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces, today's Decision and
Order exempts Evcon from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 30-second
delay.

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified in section
9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Evcon Industries, Inc. shall comply in all respects
with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces manufactured by Evcon Industries, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Effective September 7, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Evcon Industries, Inc. on
July 9, 1994. 59 FR 35916, July 14, 1994 (Case No. F&hyph;072).

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified in section
9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down
test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the
thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up,
delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner
and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace
is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on August 30, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), Post Office Box 1188, Houston,
Texas 77251&hyph;1188 filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order granting permission
and approval to abandon certain facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the
Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern states that while preparing for further proceedings in its refunctionalization proceeding in Docket
No. CP94&hyph;254&hyph;000, and upon further analysis of its system in response to the gathering orders recently
issued by the Commission, it was discovered that certain field facilities, including certain compressors, plants,
meters, dehydrators, and other miscellaneous wellhead facilities are no longer used and useful or are uneconomical
or otherwise unnecessary for continued operation of the pipeline. It is stated that this abandonment requests authorization
to abandon certain compression, plants, metering, dehydration, and other miscellaneous facilities, and to secure
all other authorizations as may be required under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern states that it is proposing to abandon a number of compressors because the wells upstream have been plugged
and abandoned by the producer and deliveries of gas have ceased. It is stated that other compression facilities will
be abandoned because the wellhead pressure has fallen below the level necessary for the gas to enter Transwestern's
facilities or gas can no longer enter Transwestern's system because the producer disconnected the well. In certain
instances, Transwestern contends that the well has been split connected or disconnected because the producer has
opted to transport the gas through another pipeline with a lower pressure line. Transwestern submits that abandonment
of other compressors is requested because the volumes of gas from the wells behind the compressors have fallen to below
the minimum level required for operation of the compressors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Transwestern, abandonment of some of the compressors is requested because the facilities are no longer
needed for one of the following reasons: (i) The gathering system behind the compressor was sold and there are no volumes
flowing into the Transwestern system; (ii) the producer decided to provide its own compression; (iii) an exchange
arrangement with another pipeline was terminated, and compression is no longer required or necessary; (iv) Transwestern's
line pressure was lowered to the point that compression is no longer required; or (v) at stations where there are multiple
units, the volume decreased to the point that one or more such units are not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern also proposes to abandon six plants, three because the producers have chosen to install their own treating
facilities for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, and therefore, the plants are no longer necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the remaining three plants, Transwestern states that one will be abandoned because the wells requiring hydrogen
sulfide removal have been plugged and abandoned, one will be abandoned because the production behind the plant no
longer consists of sour gas requiring hydrogen sulfide removal, and the third will be abandoned its operation is no
longer economically feasible due to a substantial decrease of volumes flowing through the plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transwestern states that it also proposes to abandon meters, dehydrators, and associated facilities because no
gas has flowed through the subject facilities since 1990, and it is quite certain that no gas will flow through the facilities
in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on August 31, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), tendered for filing a Fuel Reimbursement
Charge Adjustment Report pursuant to Section 27 of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised
Volume No. 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGT states that the ratio of fuel usage and unaccounted for volumes to actual deliveries determined in accordance
with Section 27 of its tariff and reflected on an attached workpaper is 2.31%. Because this percentage supports the
currently effective Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage of 2.25% requested in FGT's out-of-cycle filing on May
11, 1994, in Docket No. TM94&hyph;5&hyph;34 and approved by Commission order issued June 17, 1994, and because changes
in the Percentage must be reflected in all Shippers' arrangements with suppliers and upstream transporters and/or
gatherers, FGT is not proposing any revisions at this time. Therefore, no tariff sheets are filed with the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGT further states it will continue to closely monitor the actual quantities of fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas
as information becomes available and make such adjustments to the Fuel Reimbursement Charge Percentage as warranted
in accordance with Section 27 in order to closely match the fuel retention with actual operating experience and minimize
the over or under retention of company used fuel and unaccounted for volumes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the
filing and the interested state commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September
13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.

 Questionnaires for Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M), Biosolids Use (Biosolids), Storm Water (SW), and Combined
Sewer Overflow (CSO) Management Award Nominations Under EPA's Environmental Excellence Awards Program (EPA ICR
No. 1287.04; OMB Control No. 2040&hyph;0101).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This ICR is an extension of an existing information collection request in support of the Environmental Excellence
Awards Program. Established under section 501(e) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), the program
recognizes municipalities and industries that demonstrate outstanding technological achievements; or innovative
processes, methods or devices in their waste treatment and pollution abatement programs. The program provides a
positive incentive for compliance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system and supports sound
environmental management practices at water treatment facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the process for selection, candidates must complete and submit relevant questionnaires (Biosolids, CSO,
O&amp;M, SW) requesting: (1) Identification information; (2) planning and process reports; (3) general plant design
and layout information; (4) flow/output data; and (5) financial and management information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questionnaires are screened initially by the State or EPA Region, then forwarded through headquarters to the
EPA-sponsored National Panel (consisting of EPA, professional associations and States) for the awards selection.
A national awards ceremony is held each fall in Washington, DC to honor those facilities that are selected.

 EPA is granting California a waiver of Federal Preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act to enforce
amendments to its motor vehicle emission standards and test procedures to require more stringent evaporative emission
standards, durability requirements, and testing procedures for 1995 model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks,
medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, except petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. California
also amended its corresponding regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 I have decided to grant California a waiver of Federal preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, as
amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), for amendments to its evaporative emission standards, durability requirements,
and test procedures for 1995 model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty
vehicles and engines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive description of the California evaporative emission regulations can be found in the decision document
for this waiver and in materials submitted to the Docket by California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
California's initial waiver request included a request for waiver of Federal preemption for model years 1995 and
thereafter. In a revised waiver request California limited the applicability of its new amendments to model year
1995. EPA anticipates California to revise its evaporative emission test procedure for model year 1996 and thereafter,
and to submit an additional waiver request for such test, in order to produce a more closely aligned test procedure
with EPA's new test procedure commencing in 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 209(b) of the Act provides that, if certain criteria are met, the Administrator shall waive Federal preemption
for California to enforce new motor vehicle emission standards and accompanying enforcement procedures. The criteria
include consideration of whether California arbitrarily and capriciously determined that its standards are, in
the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the applicable Federal standards; whether California
needs State standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; and whether California's amendments are
consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) determined that these standards and accompanying enforcement procedures
do not cause California's standards, in the aggregate, to be less protective of public health and welfare than the
applicable Federal standards. No information was presented to me by any parties to demonstrate that CARB arbitrarily
or capriciously reached this protectiveness determination. Therefore, I cannot find CARB's determination to be
arbitrary and capricious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB has continually demonstrated the existence of compelling and extraordinary conditions justifying the need
for its own motor vehicle emission control program, which includes the subject standards and procedures. No information
has been submitted to demonstrate that California no longer has a compelling and extraordinary need for its own program.
Therefore, I agree that California continues to have compelling and extraordinary conditions which require its
own program, and, thus, I cannot deny the waiver on the basis of the lack of compelling and extraordinary conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB has submitted information that its emission standards and durability requirements are technologically feasible
and present no inconsistency with Federal requirements and are, therefore, consistent with section 202(a) of the
Act. Additionally, CARB determined that certain differences exist between California and Federal test procedures
but that any vehicle that satisfies California's requirements can be presumed to meet the Federal requirements.
Because of the test procedure inconsistencies described by CARB, EPA agrees that a manufacturer would be unable to
demonstrate compliance with both California and Federal requirements with the same test vehicle in the course of
a single test sequence. Therefore, EPA will accept the data used to successfully certify under CARB's 1995 model year
evaporative emissions test procedures as demonstrating compliance with applicable EPA standards. Accordingly,
I hereby grant the waiver requested by California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
My decision will affect not only persons in California but also the manufacturers outside the State who must comply
with California's requirements in order to produce motor vehicles for sale in California. For this reason, I hereby
determine and find that this is a final action of national applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may be sought only in the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Petitions for review must be filed by November 14, 1994. Under section
307(b)(2) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may not be obtained in subsequent enforcement proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with past waiver decisions, this action is not a rule as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2).
Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this action
on small business entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pesticide products may be mixed or used after other pesticides according to label directions. However, sometimes
products bear labeling statements which prohibit or advise against using certain products together or after each
other to prevent crop phytotoxicity, incompatibility, reduction of efficacy or adverse effects to humans or the
environment. The Agency is proposing guidance on when such labeling statements will be approved. The proposed policy
is that the Agency will require or approve mandatory labeling statements prohibiting or limiting use of one product
with or after another only if data are submitted which demonstrate that unreasonable adverse effects will occur without
such statements. If EPA is not persuaded by the data or no data are submitted, the Agency will approve advisory statements
which recommend that a product not be used with or after another.

The Scientific Reassessment of Dioxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In April 1991, EPA announced that it would conduct a scientific reassessment of the health risks of exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetracholorodibenzo-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-dioxin (TCDD) and chemically similar compounds collectively known as dioxin. The EPA has undertaken this task in
response to emerging scientific knowledge of the biological, human health, and environmental effects of dioxin.
Significant advances have occurred in the scientific understanding of mechanisms of dioxin toxicity, of the carcinogenic
and other adverse health effects of dioxin in people, of the pathways to human exposure, and of the toxic effects of
dioxin to the environment. The reassessment is part of the Agency's goals to improve the research and science base
and to incorporate improved research and science into EPA decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985 and 1988, the Agency prepared assessments of the human health risks from environmental exposures to dioxin.
Also, in 1988, a draft exposure document was prepared that presented procedures for conducting site-specific exposure
assessments to dioxin-like compounds. These assessments were reviewed by the Agency's Science Advisory Board (SAB).
At the time of the 1988 assessments, there was general agreement within the scientific community that there could
be a substantial improvement over the existing approach to analyzing dose response, but there was no consensus as
to a more biologically defensible methodology. The Agency was asked to explore the development of such a method. The
Agency's reassessment activities are in response to this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Stages in the Reassessment Process That Have Been Completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA had endeavored to make each phase of the reassessment of dioxin an open and participatory effort. On November
15, 1991, and April 28, 1992, public meetings were held to discuss the Agency's plans and activities for the reassessment,
to hear and receive public comments and reviews of the proposed plans, and to receive any current, scientifically
relevant information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Fall of 1992, the Agency convened two peer-review workshops to review draft documents related to EPA's scientific
reassessment of the health effects of dioxin. The first workshop was held September 10 and 11, 1992, to review a draft
exposure assessment titled, Estimating Exposures to Dioxin-Like Compounds. The second workshop was held September
22-25, 1992, to review eight chapters of a future draft Health Assessment Document for 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-dioxin (TCDD) and Related Compounds. Peer-reviewers were also asked to identify issues to be incorporated into
the risk characterization, which was under development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Fall of 1993, a third peer-review workshop was held on September 7 and 8, to review a draft of the revised and expanded
Epidemiology and Human Data Chapter, which also would be part of the future health assessment document. The revised
chapter provided an evaluation of the scientific quality and strength of the epidemiology data in the evaluation
of toxic health effects, both cancer and noncancer, from exposure to dioxin, with an emphasis on the specific congener,
2,3,7,8-TCDD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to each workshop, the draft documents or chapters were made available in keeping with the Agency's continuing
commitment to conduct the reassessment of dioxin in an open and participatory manner, to keep the public informed
of its progress, and to encourage public participation in the document development process. The public also was invited
to attend the workshops, to present oral comments, and/or to submit written comments. At each workshop, a panel of
scientific experts from outside the Agency reviewed the draft documents and provided valuable comments. It also
should be noted that outside scientists have been heavily involved throughout the developmental process of writing
and reviewing these draft documents. With this notice, the External Review Drafts of both draft documents are being
released for a 120-day public review and comment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scientific reassessment of dioxin consists of five activities:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Update and revision of the dioxin exposure assessment document.

The first four activities have resulted in two draft documents (the health assessment document and exposure document)
for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. These companion documents, which form the basis for the Agency's reassessment
of dioxin, have been used in the development of the risk characterization chapter that follows the health assessment
(Chapter 9, Volume III). The process for developing these documents consisted of three phases which are outlined
in later paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth activity, which is in progress at EPA's Environmental Research Laboratory in Duluth, Minnesota, involves
characterizing ecological risks in aquatic ecosystems from exposure to dioxins. Research efforts are focused on
the study of organisms in aquatic food webs to identify the effects of dioxin exposure that are likely to result in significant
population impacts. A report titled, Interim Report on Data and Methods for the Assessment of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-Dioxin (TCDD) Risks to Aquatic Organisms and Associated Wildlife (EPA/600/R&hyph;93/055), was published in April
1993. This report will serve as a background document for assessing dioxin-related ecological risks. Ultimately,
these data will support the development of aquatic life criteria which will aid in the implementation of the Clean
Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned previously, completion of the health assessment and exposure documents involves three phases: Phase
1 involved drafting state-of-the-science chapters and a dose-response model for the health assessment document,
expanding the exposure document to address dioxin related compounds, and conducting peer-review workshops by panels
of experts. This phase has been completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 2, preparation of the risk characterization, began during the September 1992 workshops with discussions by
the peer-review panels and formulation of points to be carried forward into the risk characterization. Following
the September 1993 workshop, this work was completed and was incorporated as Chapter 9 (Volume III) of the draft health
assessment document. This phase has been completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 3 is currently underway. It includes making External Review Drafts of both the health assessment document and
the exposure document available for public review and comment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described previously, public briefings will be held during the first week of the public comment period to be followed
by formal public hearings in December 1994. After the close of the public comment period, the Agency's Science Advisory
Board (SAB) will review the draft documents in public session (early 1995). Following SAB review, the draft documents
will be revised, comments and revisions will be incorporated, and final documents will be issued.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide
that FDA may approve applications for the export of drugs that are not currently approved in the United States. Section
802(b)(3)(B) of the act sets forth the requirements that must be met in an application for approval. Section 802(b)(3)(C)
of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine whether the requirements
of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires that the agency publish a notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

symptoms associated with menopause, atrophic vaginitis, atrophic urethritis, and osteoporosis. The firm does
have new drug approval for the Talc Triturated Conjugated Estrogen Granulation formulation. The application was
received and filed in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on March 1, 1993, which shall be considered the filing
date for purposes of the act.

Description of the Need for the Information and Its Proposed Use: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Act requires a lender of a federally related mortgate loan including refinancing
to give the loan applicant certain information and requires HUD to issue a model of that statement. HUD prepared a model
for the notices of actual transfer of servicing which Section 6 now requires servicers to issue.

Section 232(a) of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 established the Economic Development
Grant program to work in conjunction with the existing Section 108 loan guarantee program. HUD has renamed the program,
the Economic Development Initiative (EDI). The purpose of this information will be to establish application procedures
for EDI assistance. EDI will enhance the viability of projects assisted under Section 108 and increase the security
of loans made with Section 108 loan guarantee funds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988, as amended, (Public Law 100&hyph;503), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the
Conduct of Matching Programs (54 FR 25818 (June 19, 1989)), and OMB Bulletin 89&hyph;22, ``Instructions on Reporting
Computer Matching Programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress and the Public,'' the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing a public notice of its intent to conduct a computer matching program
with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to utilize a computer information system of HUD, the Credit Alert Interactive
Voice Response System (CAIVRS), with SBA's debtor files. In addition to HUD data, the CAIVRS data base now includes
delinquent debt information from the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Veterans Affairs and the Small Business
Administration. This match will allow prescreening of applicants for loans or loans guaranteed by the Federal Government
to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent in paying a debt owed to or insured by the Federal Government for HUD or SBA
direct or guaranteed loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before granting a loan, the lending agency and/or the authorized lending institution will be able to interrogate
the CAIVRS debtor file which contains the Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of HUD's delinquent debtors and defaulters
and defaulted debtor records of the SBA and verify that the loan applicant is not in default or delinquent on direct
or guaranteed loans of participating Federal programs of either agency. Authorized users place a telephone call
to the system. The system provides a recorded message followed by a series of instructions, one of which is a requirement
for the SSN of the loan applicant. The system then reports audibly whether the SSN is related to delinquent or defaulted
Federal obligations for HUD or SBA direct or guaranteed loans. As a result of the information produced by this match,
the authorized users may not deny, terminate, or make a final decision of any loan assistance to an applicant or take
other adverse action against such applicant, until an officer or employee of such agency has independently verified
such information.

Reporting: In accordance with Public Law 100&hyph;503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988,
as amended, and Office of Management and Budget Bulletin 89&hyph;22, ``Instructions on Reporting Computer Matching
Programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress and the Public;'' copies of this Notice and a report,
in duplicate, are being provided to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee
on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Authority: The matching program may be conducted pursuant to Public Law 100&hyph;503, ``The Computer Matching and
Privacy Protection Act of 1988,'' as amended, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;129 (Revised
January 1993), Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables. One of the purposes of all Executive
departments and agencies_including HUD_is to implement efficient management practices for Federal credit programs.
OMB Circular A&hyph;129 was issued under the authority of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended; the Budget
and Accounting Act of 1950, as amended; the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended; and, the Deficit Reduction Act
of 1984, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objectives to be met by the Matching Program: The matching program will allow SBA access to a system which permits prescreening
of applicants for loans or loans guaranteed by the Federal Government to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent
in paying a debt owed to or insured by the Government. In addition, HUD will be provided access to SBA debtor data for
prescreening purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Records to be matched: HUD will utilize its system of records entitled HUD/DEPT&hyph;2, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting Records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The debtor files for HUD programs involved are included in this system of records. HUD's debtor files contain information
on borrowers and co-borrowers who are currently in default (at least 90 days delinquent on their loans); or who have
any outstanding claims paid during the last three years on Title II insured or guaranteed home mortgage loans; or individuals
who have defaulted on Section 312 rehabilitation loans; or individuals who have had a claim paid in the last three years
on a Title I loan. For the CAIVRS match, HUD/DEPT&hyph;2, System of Records, receives its program inputs from HUD/DEPT&hyph;28,
Property Improvement and Manufactured (Mobile) Home Loans_Default; HUD/DEPT&hyph;32, Delinquent/Default/Assigned
Temporary Mortgage Assistance Payments (TMAP) Program; and HUD/CPD&hyph;1, Rehabilitation Loans-Delinquent/Default.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The SBA will provide HUD with debtor files contained in its system of records entitled, Loan Case File (SBA 075). HUD
is maintaining SBA's records only as a ministerial action on behalf of SBA, not as a part of HUD's HUD/DEPT&hyph;2 system
of records. SBA's data contain information on individuals who have defaulted on their direct loans. The SBA will retain
ownership and responsibility for their systems of records that they place with HUD. HUD serves only as a record location
and routine use recipient for SBA's data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice Procedures: HUD and the SBA will notify individuals at the time of application (ensuring that routine use appears
on the application form) for guaranteed or direct loans that their records will be matched to determine whether they
are delinquent or in default on a Federal debt. HUD and the SBA have published notices concerning routine use disclosures
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to inform individuals that a computer match may be performed to determine a loan applicant's credit status with the
Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Categories of Records/Individuals Involved: The debtor records include these data elements: SSN, claim number,
program code, and indication of indebteness. Categories of records include: records of claims and defaults, repayment
agreements, credit reports, financial statements, and records of foreclosures. Categories of individuals include:
former mortgagors and purchasers of HUD-owned properties, manufactured (mobile) home and home improvement loan
debtors who are delinquent or in default on their loans, and rehabilitation loan debtors who are delinquent or in default
on their loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Period of the Match: Matching will begin at least 40 days from the date copies of the signed (by both Data Integrity Boards)
computer matching agreement are sent to both Houses of Congress or at least 30 days from the date this Notice is published
in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;402) established the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal as a National Wildlife Refuge following environmental cleanup, and provided authority for the
Fish and Wildlife Service to manage the area as if it were a National Wildlife Refuge during the cleanup process. Pursuant
to the Department of Interior's Departmental Manual implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, an Environmental
Impact Statement will be prepared for all master plans for major new installations of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
The Plan will guide the development of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. Ray Rauch, Refuge Manager,
will be the responsible official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal, state and local agencies, individuals, or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the decision
regarding the Plan are invited to participate in the scoping process. Public involvement in the planning process
will be sought by 1) sending planning updates and requests for comments to agencies, organizations, and individuals,
and 2) holding open house/public comment forums in the Denver metropolitan area. Scoping meetings will be held on
September 12, 13, and 14. Locations and times for the scoping meetings will be announced in the local news media and
in a newsletter. The analysis is expected to take about 12 months. A draft environmental impact statement should be
available for public review and comment by May, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of guidance
provided by several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. Reviewers
of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the
proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Judicial review
may waive or dismiss objections that could have been raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage, but
that were not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement.

Pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c), the Administrative Law Judge issued an Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for

Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
Date: August 18, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Case No. 94&hyph;OFC&hyph;14
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Matter of: United States Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Plaintiff v.
KRT Drywall/Acoustical, Defendant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It appears that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Plaintiff U.S. Department of Labor filed the complaint herein on July 13, 1994 pursuant to the expedited hearing
procedures set forth in 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.31 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A copy of the complaint is attached hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The complaint and Plaintiff's Request for Admissions were served on Defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical by Federal
Express and were received by KRT on July 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. KRT did not file an answer, nor has it requested an extension of time within which to file an answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On August 9, 1994 Plaintiff filed a ``Motion for Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions'' on the grounds that Defendant
failed to file an answer or request an extension of time within 20 days after service of the complaint as required by
41 CFR 60&hyph;30.6(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On August 10, 1994 Defendant filed an ``Objection to Plaintiff's Motion For a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions''
requesting a denial of the Plaintiff's default motion on the grounds that the complaint ``may have been misplaced,''
and that therefore entry of default ``will work an injustice upon KRT.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On August 15, 1994 Plaintiff filed its response to Defendant's objection contending that the provisions of 41 CFR
60.32(c) are mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41 CFR 60.30.32(c) provides that if a hearing is not requested within 25 days of the filing of the complaint, the allegations
of the complaint shall be adopted as findings, and the sanctions and/or penalties sought in the complaint shall be
imposed. It appears that the above provisions of 41 CFR 60.30.32(c) are mandatory and not discretionary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Defendant has neither filed an answer nor asked for an extension of time within which to answer, and has to date
not requested a hearing in any other way, Plaintiff's Motion for Default is granted and Plaintiff's Proposed Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which are attached and incorporated herein by this reference, are adopted as the findings
herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts are immediately canceled; and that KRT
or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates),
are declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications
of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has
demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in
compliance with the provisions of the Executive Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole
any victims of its past noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive
Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.5 and 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32, Plaintiff, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,

The hearing, if requested, will be subject to the expedited hearing procedures at 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.31, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OFCCP alleges the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. This action is brought by OFCCP to enforce the contractual obligations imposed by Executive Order No. 11246 (30
Fed. Reg. 12319), as amended by Executive Order No. 11375 (32 Fed. Reg. 14303) and Executive Order 12086 (43 Fed. Reg.
46501) (hereinafter ``the Executive Order'') and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Jurisdiction exists under Sections 208 and 301 of the Executive Order and the following regulations: 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.34,
41 CFR 60&hyph;1.26 and 41 CFR 60&hyph;4.8 and 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. KRT Drywall/Acoustical (hereinafter ``Defendant'') is a construction contractor specializing in drywall work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has maintained its principal place of business in Logan, Utah.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has held a Federal or federally assisted construction contract of $10,000
or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has been a Government contractor, subcontractor or federally assisted
construction contractor within the meaning of the Executive Order and at all pertinent times has been subject to the
contractual obligations imposed on Government contractors and subcontractors by the Executive Order and the implementing
regulations issued thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. At all times pertinent hereto Defendant has been required to abide by the affirmative action requirements set forth
in 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. On May 12, 1992, OFCCP commenced a compliance review of Defendant. That review resulted in a Notice of Violation
issued on May 26, 1992, finding that Defendant had violated its affirmative action obligations in six specific respects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. On June 26, 1992, OFCCP and Defendant entered into a Conciliation Agreement resolving the deficiencies identified
in the May 26, 1992 Notice of Violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Defendant agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to provide OFCCP with personnel activity reports at six month
intervals. The reports were to include information on the number of vacancies for each craft, the number of contacts
KRT had with linkage and recruitment sources to fill those vacancies, the number of applications received by KRT from
each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number of applicants and hires by race, sex and ethnicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Conciliation Agreement was to remain in full force and effect until OFCCP determined that Defendant had submitted
two acceptable reports as defined by the Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Defendant agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to notify certain employment and recruitment organizations
when job vacancies arose and to seek referrals from those organizations. The organizations to be contacted included
the Turning Point Program, the Indian Employment Service and the Utah State Job Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The first personnel activity summary report was due on November 10, 1992, and was to cover the period of May 1, through

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. Defendant did not notify the Indian Employment Service or the Turning Point Program of these 10 openings and did
not request that these sources supply applicants for any of these positions, as agreed upon their conciliation agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Defendant's first personnel activity report was not timely submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Defendant did not specifically request qualified female and minority applicants when it listed job openings
with Job Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Defendant did not, during the period May 1, through October 31, 1992 make every good effort to recruit and employ
women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. By letter dated February 4, 1993, OFCCP notified Defendant that its untimely filing of the first personnel activity
report, its failure to specifically request affirmative action job orders when it contacted the Job Service, and
its failure to make every good faith effort to recruit and employ women during the period from May 1, through October
31, 1992, violated the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Defendant's second personnel activity report was due on May 10, 1993, and was to cover the period from November
1, 1992, through April 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. On May 7, 1993, Defendant filed with OFCCP a letter stating that there had been no hiring activity, and hence no contact
with linkage or recruitment sources during the period covered by the second report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. OFCCP contacted and visited KRT during June and July 1993 in an effort to confirm Defendant's representation that
there had been no hiring activity during the six months preceding the May 7, 1993, letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. The letter submitted by Defendant to OFCCP on May 7, 1993, misstated defendant's hiring activity during the preceding
six months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. During the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993, Defendant failed to maintain personnel records
including hire dates, termination dates and applicant information as required by the June 16, 1992, Conciliation
Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Defendant hired a number of individuals during the period from November 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. Defendant did not contact the linkage organizations agencies regarding vacancies filled during the period from
November 1, 1992, through March 30, 1993, and did not request those sources to supply applicants for any of these positions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 16 through 18, above, breached the June 16, 1992, Conciliation
Agreement Defendant entered into with OFCCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 23 through 26, above, breached the June 16, 1992, Conciliation
Agreement Defendant entered into with OFCCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. The acts and practices described in paragraphs 16 through 18 and 23 through 26, above, violate Executive Order
11246, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and therefore violate KRT Drywall/Acoustical's contractual
obligations to the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. Plaintiff notified Defendant of its determination that the company had violated its obligations under the Conciliation
Agreement. Defendant has not demonstrated that it did abide by the terms of the Conciliation Agreement and so, pursuant
to 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.34(a), enforcement proceedings may be initiated immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. KRT failed to contact the linkage organizations referenced in the June 16, 1992, Conciliation Agreement; consequently,
Defendant may have failed to consider for employment qualified individuals registered with these organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. Unless retrained by an Administrative Order, KRT Drywall/Acoustical will continue to violate the obligations
imposed upon it by the Executive Order and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wherefore, plaintiff prays for a decision and order pursuant to Section 209 of the Executive Order, 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.26
and 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;30, permanently enjoining Defendant, and its officers, agents, servants, employees, successors,
divisions and subsidiaries and those persons in active concert or participation with it from violating the Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plaintiff further prays for a decision and order debarring Defendant and its officers, agents, servants, employees,
successors, divisions and subsidiaries and those persons in active concert or participation with it, from entering
into future Government contracts, subcontractors or federally assisted construction contracts until such time
as Defendant satisfies the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it has undertaken
to correct past acts of noncompliance and that it is currently in compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, but in no event less than 210 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plaintiff further prays for a decision and order canceling any contracts Defendant may hold by the time a final order
is issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plaintiff further prays for such other relief as justice may require.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Plaintiff Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (``OFCCP'') filed this action on July 12, 1994. As is set
forth more fully in OFCCP's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions filed this date, defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical
a/k/a Construction Associates (hereinafter ``KRT'') failed to answer the Administrative Complaint or to request
a hearing within the period provided by the applicable regulations. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.6 and 60&hyph;30.32. The Administrative
Law Judge therefore is required to enter a default judgment against KRT. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c).

These reports were to include information for the relevant six-month period on the number of vacancies for each craft,
the number of contacts KRT had with linkage and recruitment sources to fill those vacancies, the number of applications
received by KRT from each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number of applicants and hires

17. On May 7, 1993, KRT filed with OFCCP a letter stating that there had been no hiring activity, and hence no contact
with linkage or recruitment sources, during the period covered by the second report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. OFCCP contacted and visited KRT during June and July 1993 in an effort to confirm KRT's representation that there
had been no hiring activity during the six months preceding the May 7, 1993, letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Conclusions of Law
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Office of Administrative Law Judges has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Sections 201, 208, and 209
of Executive Order 11246, and 41 CFR 60&hyph;1.26 and 41 CFR Part 60&hyph;30 of the Secretary of Labor's implementing
regulations, and is empowered to issue a final order determining whether KRT is in current violation of its obligations
under the Executive Order and its implementing regulations and to recommend appropriate remedies and sanctions.
41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. KRT is a Government contractor, subcontractor or Federally assisted construction contractor within the meaning
of the Executive Order. At all material times KRT has been subject to the contractual obligations imposed on Government
contractors and subcontractors by the Executive Order, and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. At all material times, KRT has been required to abide by the affirmative action requirements set forth in 41 CFR Part
60&hyph;4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. KRT breached its obligations under the Conciliation Agreement entered into on June 16, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. KRT's actions as described in the Findings of Fact, above, violate Executive Order 11246, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Executive Order, and its implementing regulations authorize sanctions, including contract cancellation
and debarment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 209 of the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Sanctions are appropriate when, as here, a contractor has failed to abide by the terms of a conciliation agreement,
and is in violation of the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Under the applicable regulation where, as here, a defendant fails to answer an administrative complaint or to request
a hearing within 20 days of service of that complaint, its right to a hearing shall be deemed waived and the Administrative
Law Judge shall order the sanctions and remedies sought in the administrative complaint. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. For these reasons, I order that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts immediately be canceled and that
KRT or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates),
be declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications
of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has
demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in
compliance with the provisions of the Executive Order and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that it has
undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole any victims of its past
noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive Order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering the issuance of a Confirmatory Order modifying
the August 7, 1991, Order (the Decommissioning Order) which authorized the Dairyland Power Cooperative (DPC, the
licensee) to decommission the La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor (LACBWR). LACBWR is located 19 miles south of La Crosse,
Wisconsin.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would allow DPC to: (i) make limited changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning
Plan; and (ii) conduct certain tests and experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC
approval. The licensee requested, by letters dated August 2, and August 5, 1994, that the NRC issue an order that revises
the Decommissioning Order to allow DPC limited flexibility under its Decommissioning Plan. This action is consistent
with the flexibility under 10 CFR 50.59 afforded to a licensee authorized to operate a production or utilization facility
and afforded by other Decommissioning Orders issued by the NRC.

The LACBWR has been shut down since April 30, 1987. All spent fuel has been removed from the reactor and is stored in the
fuel element storage well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee's authority to operate LACBWR was removed by license Amendment No. 56, dated August 4, 1987. The licensee
is authorized to possess but not operate the LACBWR. The NRC in its Order (Decommissioning Order) of August 7, 1991,
directed DPC to decommission the reactor facility in accordance with its Decommissioning Plan and the Commission's
regulations. This action was taken in response to the licensee's application for authorization to decommission
the facility, dated December 21, 1987, as revised February 22, 1988, September 9, 1988, September 30, 1988, January
26, 1989, March 28, 1989, June 6, 1989, October 3, 1989, July 25, 1990, May 10, 1991, and July 25, 1991. Neither the August
7, 1991, Decommissioning Order which directed the licensee to decommission the reactor facility, nor the approved
Decommissioning Plan, contained an approved procedure that would allow the licensee to: (i) make changes in the facility
or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning
Plan, without prior NRC approval. The LACBWR is currently in SAFSTOR in accordance with the approved LACBWR Decommissioning
Plan. This Confirmatory Order would modify the Decommissioning Order and allow the licensee to: (i) make limited
changes in the facility or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct certain tests or experiments
not described in the Decommissioning Plan without prior NRC approval.

Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action, procedural in nature, does not involve any significant environmental impacts. The proposed
Confirmatory Order modifies the Decommissioning Order to allow the licensee to: (i) make changes in the facility
or procedures as described the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning
Plan without prior NRC approval provided they do not involve an unreviewed safety question or a significant environmental
impact not previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed action does not involve a change in plant operation or configuration, there is reasonable assurance
that the proposed action would not increase the probability or the consequence of an accident or reduce the margin
of safety. No changes would be made in the types or quantities of effluent that may be released offsite. Further, there
would be no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative radiation exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the NRC concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological plant
effluent and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the NRC has concluded that there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the proposed action,
any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would
be to deny the request. This would not significantly reduce environmental impacts of plant decommissioning and would
result in reduced flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Environmental Assessment included
as an enclosure to the Decommissioning Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Environmental Assessment was prepared by the NRC staff, primarily within the Office of Nuclear Material Safety
and Safeguards, Rockville, Maryland. The NRC staff consulted with a representative of the State of Wisconsin regarding
the environmental impact of the proposed action, and the State did not provide comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon this Environmental Assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC has determined not to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement for the proposed Confirmatory Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposes to amend its system of records entitled ``NRC&hyph;32, Licensee and
Applicant Taxpayer Identification Number Records_NRC,'' to establish six new routine uses which will enhance the
NRC's ability to collect certain license fee debts owed to the U.S. Government. Existing routine use b. is redesignated
h. New routine use b. permits the disclosure of information in the system to the Defense Manpower Data Center of the
Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, and other Federal, State, or local agencies for computer
matching to identify individuals who are (1) delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to NRC and (2) receiving Federal
salary or benefit payments. NRC will use the information obtained as a result of the matching to collect the debts under
the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365) by voluntary repayment, by administrative
or salary offset, or by referral to collection agencies. New routine use c. permits the disclosure of information
in the system to the General Accounting Office, Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney, or other Federal agencies for
further collection action on delinquent accounts. New routine use d. permits disclosures to commercial credit reporting
agencies to obtain or add to a credit history file for use in the administration of debt collection. New routine use
e. permits disclosures to any Federal agency where an NRC debtor is employed or receiving remuneration to enable that
agency to collect a debt owed to the NRC. New routine use f. permits disclosure to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
for computer matching under 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer to collect or to compromise
a claim by NRC against a taxpayer under 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3717, and 3718. New routine use g. permits the disclosure of information
from the system to the IRS to collect a debt by offset against the debtor's tax refunds under the Federal Tax Refund Offset
Program.

Other revisions to the system of records notice are also being made. These include changes to (1) clarify the categories
of individuals covered, (2) add paper records to the categories of records, (3) update the authority for maintaining
the system, and (4) expand the record source categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

under certain programs or services administered by the NRC in order to collect the debts under the provisions of the
Debt Collection Act of 1982 (5 U.S.C. 5514) by voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment, by administrative or salary offset, or by referral to collection contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. To the U.S. General Accounting Office, Department of Justice, United States Attorney, or other Federal agencies
for further collection action on any delinquent account when circumstances warrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the IRS may be made only for debt collection purposes, including to a debt collection agency to facilitate the collection
or compromise of a Federal claim under the Debt Collection Act of 1982, except that redisclosure of a mailing address
to a commercial reporting agency is for the limited purpose of obtaining a commercial credit report on the particular
taxpayer. Any such mailing address information obtained from the IRS will not be used or shared for any other NRC purpose
or disclosed by NRC to another Federal, State, or local agency which seeks to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request
for a reclearance of an information collection. Form SF 2803, Application to Make Deposit or Redeposit (CSRS), and
SF 3108, Application to Make Service Credit Payment for Civilian Service (FERS), are applications to make payment
used by persons who are eligible to pay for Federal service which was not subject to retirement deductions and/or for
Federal service which was subject to retirement deductions which were subsequently refunded to the applicant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are estimated to be 520 respondents for SF 2803 and 260 respondents for SF 3108. It takes approximately 30 minutes
to complete SF 2803 and 30 minutes to complete SF 3108. The annual burden hours for SF 2803 is 260 and the annual burden
hours for SF 3108 is 130 for a total annual burden of 390 hours.

In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE removes the term ``NMS securities'' and replaces it with ``Nasdaq National Market securities,''
National Market securities,'' or ``NM securities.'' In addition, Amendment No. 1 confirms that surveillance procedures
had been or would be implemented by the CBOE in order for the CBOE to be deemed a ``qualified Options exchange'' that
satisfies the requirements of the NASD's short-sale rule (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;92&hyph;12). See letter
from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite, to Francois Mazur, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''),

A. Introduction

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Exchanges have submitted substantially similar proposals to the Commission to amend their respective rules
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 so as to coordinate them with the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice relating to a bid test applicable to short sales of NM
securities traded through Nasdaq.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The proposals require Exchange members who initiate, accept, or transmit for execution, or execute sales of NM securities
for the account of another Exchange member, to designate such sales as long sales, short sales, or bid test exempt sales.
Accordingly, NASD members who receive orders to sell NM securities from or for the account of Exchange members will
have a basis to determine whether such sales are short sales subject to or exempt from the bid test.

An executing NASD member is required to make a good-faith determination whether an order is long, short, or bid test
exempt. Thus, an NASD member is prohibited from effecting a short sale for the account of a customer or for its own account
directly or through the offices of a third party for the purpose of avoiding the application of the short sale rule.
Further, an NASD member is prohibited from knowingly, or with reason to know, effecting sales for the account of a customer
or for its own account for the purpose of avoiding the rule. It is the belief of the NASD that NASD members' activities
to circumvent the short sale rule through indirect actions such as executions with other members or through facilitation
of customer orders while being protected from loss are antithetical to the purposes of the rule. See NASD Rules, Article
III, Section 48.

Under NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48, sales of NM securities may be designated as bid test exempt if they qualify
for one or more of the exemptions from the bid test included in the rule. One of these exemptions applies to short sales
effected by ``qualified options market makers''
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 (``market maker exemption'') to hedge offsetting options positions. This exemption recognizes the need for options
market makers to hedge their options positions by buying or selling (including selling short) shares of underlying
stocks or underlying component stocks contained in stock indexes.

A ``qualified options market maker'' is an options market maker who has received an appointment as a ``qualified options
market maker'' for certain classes of stock options on Nasdaq National Market securities and index options on qualified
stock indexes pursuant to the rules of a ``qualified options exchange.'' See NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48(h)(2)(b).
For a definition of a ``qualified options exchange,'' see infra note 16 and accompanying text.

To benefit from the bid test exemption afforded to qualified options market makers, a market maker must be designated
as a qualified options market maker by a ``qualified options exchange.''
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD Rules define a ``qualified options exchange'' as a national securities exchange with Commission approved
rules and procedures governing the designation of qualified options makers. In addition, to be deemed a ``qualified
options exchange,'' the NASD Rules require an exchange to implement procedures governing the surveillance of its
market makers' use of the exemption, as well as to require the exchange to authorize the NASD to limit the designation
of a qualified options market maker where the options exchange finds substantial, willful, or continuing violations
of its rule governing qualified options market makers.

The Exchanges' rules governing qualified options market makers will be implemented as an eighteen month pilot and
will be effective concurrently with the NASD's bid test rule pilot program. The proposals are subject to modification
or termination at the end of the pilot period. Additionally, the exchanges will require market makers to designate
the NM securities to which the NASD market maker exemption will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an Exchange determines that a qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the market maker
exemption, that Exchange may withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker based
upon that Exchange's determination that such action is warranted in light of the substantial, willful, or continuing
nature of the violation. Each Exchange also will notify the NASD of such a determination so that the NASD may take steps
to ensure that Nasdaq NM sales are executed in compliance with all applicable NASD rules. Moreover, the Exchanges
have designed surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the proposed rule change. Specifically, these
procedures must be implemented to allow the Exchanges to be deemed qualified options exchanges as that term is defined
by the NASD pursuant to the options market maker exemption.

The CBOE proposes to adopt Rule 15.10 to require members to designate sales of Nasdaq NM securities as long sales, short
sales, or bid-test exempt sales.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE proposal allows a short sale to be designated as bid-test exempt if the sale qualifies for one of the NASD's
bid-test exemptions, or, as further provided in the NASD's rule, if the short sale is an exempt hedge transaction in
a ``designated NM security''
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 underlying a class of stock options, or included in an index underlying a class of index options for which the market
maker holds an appointment under the CBOE's rules.

Under the CBOE's proposal, a registered market maker will be considered a qualified options market maker in options
on properly designated NM securities. Such a market maker is entitled to engage in ``exempt hedge transactions''
with respect to those NM securities.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE's proposed rule will remain effective for the eighteen month pilot period of the NASD's short sale rule, or
for whatever period the market maker short sale exemption remains effective.

The CBOE defines an ``exempt hedge transaction,'' consistent with the definition in the NASD's short sale rule, as
a short sale in an NM security effected to hedge, and which in fact serves to hedge, an existing offsetting options position
or an offsetting options position that was created in one or more transactions contemporaneous with the short sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to index options, the CBOE will require that the NM security sold short be a component security of the index
underlying such index option, that at least 10 percent of the value of the index underlying such index option be represented
by one or more NM securities, and that the current aggregate value of the NM securities sold short not exceed the aggregate
current index value of the index options position being hedged. Once an underlying index satisfies the 10 percent
test, the continued qualification of the index shall be reviewed as of the end of each quarter, and the index shall cease
to qualify if the value of the index represented by one or more NM securities is less than 8 percent at the end of any subsequent
year. See CBOE Proposed Rule 15.10(c)(2)(ii)(A). See also NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48(h)(2)(d) (defining
``qualified stock index'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transaction unrelated to normal options market making activity, such as index arbitrage or risk arbitrage, that
is independent of a market maker's market making functions, will not be considered an exempt hedge transaction. See

The CBOE proposal also provides that if one of its members initiates, accepts for execution, transmits for execution,
or executes a short sale of an NM security without properly identifying it, such a sale may violate certain CBOE rules.
In addition, if a participant designates a short sale as a bid test exempt sale, including claiming the sale to be exempt
by reason of the market maker exemption, but does not satisfy the requirements for such an exemption, or if the sale
is made with the purpose of disrupting or manipulating the market in the security that is the subject of the sale of a
related option, such a sale may also violate certain CBOE rules.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE has designed surveillance procedures to monitor member compliance with the CBOE's proposed rule once it
becomes effective.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the CBOE has stated its commitment to notify the NASD if the CBOE determines that there has been a substantial,
willful, or continuing violation of its proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Phlx proposal is substantially the same as the CBOE proposal. The Phlx's proposal creates new Rule 1072 entitled
Reporting Requirements Applicable to Short Sales in NASD/NM Securities. The Phlx proposal applies to Registered
Options Traders (``ROTs'') and specialists. In its original filing, Phlx ROTs and specialists were both limited
to designating Nasdaq NM securities underlying no more than twenty of the options or index options, which the specialist
or ROT has been allocated or assigned respectively, as designated Nasdaq NM securities. The Phlx has since amended
its proposal to state that a Phlx specialist may designate all Nasdaq NM securities in which it is registered.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 The Phlx proposal also amends Phlx Rule 455(d)(12) (Short Sales) by adding a reference to its new Rule 1072.

The Amex proposal is substantially the same as the CBOE proposal. The Amex proposal adds a new paragraph (d) to its Rule
957, Accounts, Orders and Records of Registered Traders Specialists and Associated Persons. The Amex refers to options
specialists and registered options traders, as those terms have the same basic meaning as the CBOE term ``market maker.''
The Amex proposal also amends Amex Rule 590 (Minor Rule Violation Fine Systems) by adding a reference to new paragraph
(d) of its Rule 957.

The NYSE's proposal is structured differently from those of the CBOE and other Exchanges, though it is not dissimilar
in effect. Instead of referring to ``Nasdag NM securities,'' the NYSE refers to ``Nasdag NMS securities,'' defining
such securities as having the meaning that Part I of Schedule D to the By-Laws of the NASD assigns either to NM or NMS securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

listed option.

Unlike the CBOE proposal, the NYSE proposed rule does not state explicitly the prohibition against its members transacting

is available only if the short sale is related to normal market making activity.

In its filing, the NYSE states that its specialists are subject to market making obligations with respect to all activity
in their assigned specialty options and COTs are subject to market making obligations with respect to all activity
in all Exchange listed options. Nevertheless, the NYSE proposal also includes a requirement that the market maker
exemption only be available for transactions ``related to market making activity'' in order to accommodate the possibility
that the Exchange may someday limit the scope or parameters pursuant to which COTs must fulfill their market making
obligations in a manner similar to that of the options market makers on the options exchanges that divide their floors
into zones. See File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;22.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission believes that the Exchanges' proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. Specifically, the Commission
believes the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in that they are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public
interest. The proposals coordinate the Exchanges' rules with the NASD's bid test applicable to short sales of NM securities.
The bid test is intended to reduce the potential for abusive short selling practices in the Nasdaq market without restricting
options market makers who may need to sell stocks short in order to hedge options positions resulting from their market
making activities.

The first requirement imposed by the NASD for an exchange to be a ``qualified options exchange'' is that it have approved
rules and procedures for designating market makers as qualified options market makers. These standards must be designed
to identify options market makers who regularly engage in market making activities in the particular options class(es).
Accordingly, the CBOE proposal states that a CBOE market maker will be considered a ``qualified options market maker''
in options on properly ``designated NM securities.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

not allowing the market maker exemption to be extended beyond its original purpose.

A Phlx ROT may designate NM securities underlying no more than 20 of the options or index options which the ROT has been
allocated or assigned as designated NM securities; a Phlx specialist may designate NM securities underlying all
the options or index options for which the specialist is registered. See Phlx Proposed Rule 1072(c)(2) (ii) &amp;
(iii). Designated securities of an Amex ROT or options specialist are NM securities underlying a class of stock options
or included in an index underlying a class of index options in which the specialist is registered or the ROT is assigned.
See Amex Proposed Rule 957(d)(2)(b)(i). A PSE market maker may designate NM securities underlying options or included
in an index underlying options for which he holds an appointment on the PSE options floor. See PSE Proposed Rule 4.19(c)(2)(B)(ii).
For NYSE specialists and COTS, designated securities include assigned specialty options for NYSE options specialists,
and all securities underlying NYSE-listed options with respect to NYSE COTS. See File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;22.

The CBOE proposal defines an ``exempt hedge transaction'' as a short sale in an NM security that was effected to hedge,
and in fact serves to hedge, an existing offsetting options position or an offsetting options position that was created
in one or more transactions contemporaneous with the short sale. See CBOE Proposed Rule 15.10(c)(2)(ii)(A), and

The second requirement for an Exchange to be deemed a ``qualified options exchange'' pursuant to the NASD's rules
is that the exchange have procedures providing for the surveillance of its market makers' use of the market maker exemption
set forth in NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48(h)(1). The purpose of such procedures is to ensure that short sales
effected by qualified options market makers are exempt hedge transactions and that other non-qualified market makers
are not using the exemption. The Commission is satisfied that the Exchanges have provided for the implementation
of such procedures to become effective with the implementation of the NASD's bid test rule. These procedures are intended
to monitor market maker use of the market maker exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, each Exchange, in its respective proposal, has stated that if it determines that a qualified options market
maker has failed to comply with the terms of the exemption, the Exchange may withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation
of a qualified options market maker based upon the Exchange's determination of the substantial, willful, or continuing
nature of the violation.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 The purpose of this provision is to satisfy the third NASD requirement for an exchange to be deemed a qualified options
exchange. That requirement states that an exchange must have rules and procedures authorizing the NASD to withdraw,
suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker if the qualified options exchange has determined
that the qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the market maker exemption, and that
such a withdrawal, suspension, or modification of the market maker's exemption is warranted in light of the substantial,
willful, or continuing nature of the violation.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also notes that because each Exchange proposal contains a commitment to notify the NASD of such a determination,
the Exchanges have provided the NASD with the means to withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified
options market maker insofar as Nasdaq NM securities are involved.

Moreover, the CBOE, in its proposal, provides that it will not be deemed a violation of the proposed rule when a member
designates a short sale as bid test exempt where the member does not know or have reason to know that the criteria for
designating such a sale as bid test exempt are not satisfied. See CBOE Proposed Rule 15.10(e). With the exception of
the NYSE, the other exchanges have very similar provisions. See Phlx Proposed Rule 1072(e); Amex Proposed Rule 957(d)(4);
and PSE Proposed Rule 4.19(e).

The Commission approved the NASD's short sale rule on an eighteen month temporary basis, effective September 6, 1994,
through March 5, 1996.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 In doing so, the Commission stated that questions remain whether the market maker exemption from the short sale rule
is appropriate on an ongoing basis. The Commission noted that specialists and other market makers do not enjoy similar
exemptions from the Commission's short sale rule for listed securities under Rule 10a&hyph;1 under the Exchange
Act. Consequently, the Exchanges' proposals are approved on a temporary basis, to remain in effect so long as there
exists a market maker exemption to the NASD's short sale rule.

If the NASD later amends its short sale rule in a manner that affects the market maker exemption, including its definition,
conditions, and requirements, the Exchanges might be required to amend their respective companion market maker
exemption rules so that the Exchanges' members may avail themselves of any continued market maker exemption.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the eighteen-month temporary approval period for the NASD's bid test rule, the Commission expects the Exchanges
to gather data on the operation and effectiveness of the rules and procedures relating to the market maker exemption.
In particular, the Exchanges should focus on: gathering data regarding the number of market makers using the market
maker exemption, and the frequency with which they use it; the sufficiency of the surveillance procedures; difficulties
in administering the market maker exemption and the accompanying surveillance procedures; and the nature of any
violations of the market maker exemption.

The Commission finds good cause for approving File Nos. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;09, and Amendment Nos. 1 and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each of the Exchanges' proposed rule changes and amendments is consistent with the CBOE's proposal, notice of which
was published on May 18, 1994,
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 and contain only minor variations from the CBOE proposal. As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists
for approving the foregoing rule proposals and amendments on an accelerated basis given that the implementation
date of the NASD bid test rule is September 6, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 11, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final labeling regulations implementing
section 611 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The regulations include
a section which permits a manufacturer to petition EPA to temporarily exempt a product manufactured with a class I
substance from the labeling requirements. The company must prove that there are no substitutes that: do not rely on
the use of a class I substance; reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment; and, are currently or potentially
available. Through this action, EPA proposes to grant petitions for such exemptions for the two specific applications
of products manufactured with class I substances described below, because substitutes that do not rely on the use
of class I substances and reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment are neither potentially nor currently
available. The effect of this action will be to provide the extensions necessary for these two petitioners to develop
potentially available substitutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 611 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, requires EPA to promulgate regulations requiring labeling of products
manufactured with, and products and containers containing, ozone-depleting substances. On February 11, 1993 at
58 FR 8136, EPA published the final regulations at 40 CFR part 82, subpart E (40 CFR 82.100 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Section 82.120 of the final labeling regulations (40 CFR 82.120), states that a company may petition EPA to temporarily
exempt a product manufactured with a class I substance. To get the exemption, the company must prove that there are
no substitutes that: (1) Do not rely on the use of a class I substance; (2) reduce the overall risk to human health and
the environment; and (3) are currently or potentially available. In the regulations, EPA defines ``potentially
available'' to mean that adequate information exists to support a determination that a substitute for a class I substance
is environmentally acceptable, economically viable, and technologically feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition provision allows the Agency to exempt products manufactured with class I substances from the labeling
requirements where a company shows that it has been unsuccessful in identifying a commercially or potentially available
alternative substance or manufacturing process for its current use of the class I substance and where the Agency finds
that no such alternative substance or process is ``potentially available.'' The two petitions claimed that alternatives
were not ``potentially available'' at this time. In one case, the argument was made that additional time is required
in order to accommodate an extensive evaluation and approval process required by another Federal entity; and, in
the other case, implementation of possible substitutes/manufacturing processes remain uncertain, requiring
additional development of the possible alternative process before full-scale construction of three new manufacturing
facilities can begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the petition review process, EPA developed criteria by which to evaluate the submissions. Unlike the Significant
New Alternatives Policy Program (SNAP) petitions naming acceptable substitutes for eight sectors of industry submitted
under section 612 of the CAA, the petitions submitted under section 611 are reviewed on a case-by-case basis with careful
attention given to each application of a class I substance in a manufacturing process. The Agency considered all of
the factors below in determining whether to accept or reject a petition with regard to the technological feasibility
and the environmental acceptability of a substitute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating technological feasibility, EPA considers when the company first began investigating alternative
substances or processes to replace their uses of class I substances; EPA's knowledge about the product/manufacturing
process and possible substitutes; whether parallel manufacturers of similar products have come up with substitutes;
whether a timeline has been developed for implementation of a substitute, including research and development of
a substitute process where applicable; and, whether the timeline seems reasonable where no substitute is commercially
available. In addition, the Agency considers a company's constraints (technology, other Federal requirements,
etc.) in order to determine whether a change is within the control of the company; whether a company is able to state
what it must specifically do to implement the substitute; whether training and procurement of equipment and manufacturing
materials are accessible; what measures have been taken to understand and solve the ``unknowns;'' whether vendors
exist that can meet the product's manufacturing needs; and whether the company has discussed its manufacturing needs
with these vendors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating environmental acceptability, EPA considers whether a substitute is environmentally implementable
in terms of the available technology.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general these criteria were considered collectively. However, EPA believes that for most companies, implementation
of an alternative, whether it be a drop-in replacement or a complete overhaul of the production process, often entails
significant cost and time constraints. EPA recognizes that companies need lead time in establishing a labeling program
or installing an alternative technology where companies have chosen to switch from a class I substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a substitute in order to comply with the regulations. Companies that have not implemented a substitute are required
to label their products until they have implemented a substitute. Therefore, where a company's early efforts to replace
its uses of controlled substances are prevented through 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unavoidable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 obstacles beyond its control, such as a required Federal review or permit program, or where a substitute requires
additional development through testing due to unknown or unavoidable impediments, EPA has placed greater weight
on such circumstances in developing its determinations, because the ability of a company to switch to an alternative
is seriously hampered by circumstances outside of its control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA emphasizes that its process of evaluating a company's request for exemption from the labeling requirements is
a different review process from the essential use exemption authorized by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Parties) and could well reach different conclusions. Under the Montreal
Protocol process, member countries can put forth nominations for essential use exemptions that would allow for continued
production of ozone-depleting substances after the production phaseout, to be used in an application for which there
are no suitable substitutes. The Parties receive and review these applications individually and may decide to grant
particular exemption requests. If the Parties agree that a particular applications is essential, additional production
of an ozone-depleting substance will be authorized for that particular application after the phaseout has taken
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 20, 1993 (58 FR 29410), requesting essential use nominations for CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform
and HBFCs by July 19, 1993. The Agency requested nominations for essential uses of halons on February 12, 1993 (58 FR
6788). Companies nominated their specific applications of a controlled substance to receive an exemption from the
production and consumption phaseout schedule. These nominations are reviewed first by EPA and then by the Montreal
Protocol Parties. The Parties recognized the need for such exemptions because of the accelerated phaseout dates.
Exemptions, if any, will be granted at the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, which may be held as early as June 1994. Nominations
for halon essential uses will be considered earlier since halons are subject to an even more rapid phaseout schedule.
Nominations for essential uses will continue to be considered each year at subsequent meetings of the Parties; thus,
companies will have additional opportunities to request an essential use exemption in the future. The process will
entail a rigorous international review process, which is described in Decision IV/25 of the Fourth Meeting of the
Protocol. Therefore, if a company requests a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements through &sect;82.120
of the labeling regulations, and also wishes to request an exemption for use of controlled substances beyond the phaseout
date, the company must separately nominate its use for an essential use exemption to EPA.

II. Petitions for Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, EPA proposes to accept two petitions. The first petition, submitted by the Upjohn Company (Upjohn), contends
that Upjohn has a substitute for its use of CFC&hyph;12 as a sterilant; however, a review and evaluation period is required
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the alternative can be approved and then implemented. The company
therefore contends that a substitute is not potentially available until the FDA review is completed. EPA is proposing
to grant this exemption until August 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other petition, submitted by the E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. (DuPont), is classified as confidential business
information and thus, EPA cannot disclose the name of its product. (Dupont has produced a petition containing nonconfidential
information that has been placed into the docket). This product, which consists of certain fine synthetic fibers,
uses CFC&hyph;11 as a basic process solvent in the fiber manufacturing process. Although Dupont has identified a
possible substitute, it must develop, implement and test a major process change to replace the existing manufacturing
facilities. Therefore, Dupont contends that a substitute is not potentially available until this process has been
identified and current facilities have been successfully modified to ensure that this alternative can in fact be
accommodated.

A. The Upjohn Company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Upjohn Company (Upjohn) submitted a petition to exempt six of its pharmaceutical products that are currently
sterilized using CFC&hyph;12 from the labeling requirements. The products are Hydrocortisone, Isoflupredone
Acetate, Methylprednisolone acetate, Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Neomycin Sulfate and Prednisolone Hydrous
USP. The company has submitted a request to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept Spectinomycin Hydrochloride,
a non-ozone-depleting substance, as a replacement for CFC&hyph;12. The alternative is currently used by Upjohn
to sterilize some of its other products; however, FDA review and evaluation is required before it can make a change.
Therefore, Upjohn is submitting this petition based on the premise that the above mentioned products are not currently
or potentially available until FDA approval is obtained. There are no environmental concerns identified with this
substitution; the company clearly has an alternative which it has instituted in other applications and requires
additional time before it can use the substitute in the above applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without an exemption, the company asserts that it would be required to label the five products until FDA concludes
its review, which would result in a substantial financial loss with little if any environmental benefit. The company
also maintains that by labeling its five products while FDA reviews their submission, users could become confused
by the warning statement and could decide to discontinue use of the products against the advice of their physicians.
Upjohn indicates that such an outcome could result in increased absenteeism from work and potentially severe negative
health effects and expenses incurred by society.

B. DuPont 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DuPont currently manufactures a fine synthetic fiber using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC&hyph;11). DuPont began searching
for an alternative in 1987 and initiated a research and development (R&amp;D) program to find an alternative substance
for the CFC&hyph;11. The R&amp;D program was comprised of the following activities: identifying all non-CFC candidates
for replacements; acquiring or fabricating (where none were commercially available) all potential candidates
for testing; conducting tests to ascertain that each candidate possessed the desired properties; further evaluating
those which passed the initial tests in laboratory reviews; performing additional examinations once the candidates
passed the laboratory tests; then performing testing to determine the acceptability of the test product. For six
years, DuPont has researched over 100 potential candidates which hold specific properties required for production
of the fiber. This search has included all reasonable chemical classes including (but not limited to): HCFCs, HFCs,
perfluorinated hydrocarbons, alcohols, and amines. After consideration of these and other potential alternatives,
Dupont determined that no drop-in or replacement compound (i.e. a substitute that does not require retrofitting
of equipment) for the current manufacturing process was possible. Dupont identified only one or two possible replacement
candidates, which will require complete testing and development and which, even if successful, will require specially
designed and engineered new production facilities. All of the unsuccessful replacement candidates failed to possess
at least one of the physical and chemical properties needed in the manufacturing process. The critical properties
include corrosion characteristics, critical temperature, toxicity, boiling point and ozone depletion potential.
Moreover, use of the possible non-CFC replacement at the current manufacturing facilities is not compatible with
the existing plant process and permits, as well as OSHA and other safety code restrictions. Thus, testing of any non-CFC
replacement must occur at new specially designed and engineered facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a candidate substance has been identified as a possible substitute, Dupont continues to face various technical
difficulties in implementing a new process change. Once a substitute is identified as a possible replacement, pilot
testing of the candidate in a smaller version of a large-scale production facility, the preparation of the design
of the larger facilities, and construction of the plants must ensue in order for the alternative to be tested for large
scale production. DuPont has obtained the necessary local, state and Federal operating permits and general approval
from the appropriate environmental authorities to design, construct and test the pilot plant which will further
verify the production technology and equipment, the new process, and establish new procedures and practices for
the facility operators. In May 1993, this specially engineered and constructed pilot plant was constructed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DuPont indicates that it will spend millions of dollars over the next several years for implementation and production
trials in the new facilities. Two years of development activities are planned for the pilot facility in order to test
and refine the manufacturing process. The plant continues to be modified as the need for technical adjustments arise
from the trial runs. This occurs simultaneously with the design of the first facility, selection of a contractor and
construction of the facility. There will be additional actions required to prepare for the first round of commercial
production trials once the facility is built. DuPont will need to certify that each end use for the new fiber product
meets the standards of each customer base, including industry, local, state, and Federal standards. The standards
vary, requiring distinct examinations in order to determine whether for each end use, the product is capable of the
same performance standards as the product made with a CFC. In addition, personnel require retraining, a new workforce
is necessary to carry out the tests for product standards and certifications, and process control systems need monitoring.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DuPont contends that until all of the plants have been constructed, fully evaluated for their productability, and
full-scale production of the saleable fiber product has been initiated following completion of the standards testing,
no substitute is potentially available. Because of these various technical difficulties in design, and process
changes to accommodate further investigation of the potential alternative, the Agency concurs that Dupont has subsequently
shown that an alternative is neither potentially nor currently available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although DuPont estimates it will be unable to meet the global demand for its product by the end of 1996, the substitute
would then be considered to be potentially available, as some of the plants will have undergone equipment quality
checks and production tests and begun producing the product.

III. Proposed Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to accept these two petitions for temporary exemptions from the labeling requirements until the dates
specified by the petitioners. No company may exceed its deadline without first obtaining approval by the EPA. If the
need for an additional extension is required by either company, an addendum to the petition must be submitted to the
Agency requesting an extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Upjohn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that in this case, the alternative identified in the petition is neither potentially nor currently available,
due to additional Federal requirements regarding approval or disapproval of the substitute, which preclude the
company from implementing the change until after a determination under such requirements is made. The circumstances
are outside of the company's control. Absent the FDA requirements, Upjohn would be able to introduce the alternative
substance to its sterilizing operation. This proposed determination is consistent with regulations implementing
section 610 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 which state that companies seeking Federal approval of substitute
chemicals or reformulations may receive a temporary exemption (ninety days) from the product ban requirements (58
FR 69667). In those regulations, EPA recognized that other Federal approval processes can be time-consuming and
beyond the control of the manufacturer. Until approval is obtained, a substitute is not potentially available. EPA
maintains that it would be inappropriate for the federal government to deny a manufacturer a temporary exemption
from the labeling regulations while at the same time preventing them from implementing a substitute pending receipt
of a required Federal approval for their alternative substance or process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. DuPont 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that DuPont's request for a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements is appropriate given
the task and the uncertainties it has encountered and continues to face in developing a substitute and implementing
a major process change to replace an existing system that currently depends on the use of a CFC. DuPont contends that
its alternative process is not potentially available until the company is certain that the alternative process works
in its facilities. In order for the company to ensure that large scale production is possible, it must first construct
new facilities, test the functioning of the new systems and perform full scale production tests. Until production
tests are completed in these facilities, due to significant differences in technical design, no substitutes are
potentially available. DuPont indicates that current problems it is experiencing with the pilot facility are due
to unanticipated and unknown factors, requiring delays in testing of the new design until the problems are resolved
and the necessary modifications are made to the system. However, as the new system is undergoing the required tests,
DuPont is constructing its new facilities. The designs of the facilities are based solely on the results of the trials
at the pilot facility, rather than on existing designs, thereby creating unknown obstacles which can significantly
impede the company's switch to an alternative process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a substitute process is not potentially available for the fiber product, which currently depends
on a process that uses a CFC, until the company can be reasonably assured that its new systems actually work with the
candidate substitute and can produce a product that meets the company's and its customers' quality standards in a
large scale production process. While EPA believes that this waiver should be granted until January 1, 1996, EPA would
like any information on whether extending the waiver to this January 1, 1996 is appropriate.

IV. Changes to the Conditions of the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to establish provisions to ensure that petitioners meet the conditions agreed upon in a petition exemption.
Companies that receive a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements must notify EPA if the agreed-upon conditions
of the exemption change in any way, such as a modification in a Federal entity's schedule for evaluation, slippage
in a company's implementation of an alternative substance or process, or a shift in corporate priorities. Failure
to notify the Agency of such changes to the agreement will result in the Agency's withdrawal of the exemption.

V. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority for the action proposed in this notice is section 611(e) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7625&hyph;1(a)(1)).

VI. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order (EO) 12866, the Agency must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and thus subject
to OMB review. The decision proposed today is not a regulation, rule or significant regulatory action, as defined
in EO 12866; therefore, no OMB review is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever the Agency is required to publish a
general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment
a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact on small entities. Since today's proposed decision
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, no regulatory flexibility analysis
has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On April 14, 1994, the Executive Office of the President published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of intent to form a 30-member policy dialog advisory committee to assist in the development of measures to
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. That notice set forth the purpose of
the committee and its goals, and asked for suggestions from the public for members of the committee. The period for
public comment in response to the notice ended May 4, 1994. Over 160 comments, suggesting more than 170 potential committee
members, were submitted in response to the notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As set forth in the April 14, 1994 notice, the policy dialog arises out of the President's Climate Change Action Plan,
issued in October 1993. The committee will develop recommendations on the sets of policies that would, if adopted,
most cost-effectively obtain a return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles by
the years 2005, 2015 and 2025, with no upturn thereafter. This framework of achievement of 1990 emissions levels in
three alternative years is intended to focus the issues and the recommendations to be considered by the committee.
Decisions on the amount and timing of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, and the
policies to attain them, remain the responsibility of the federal government. The Administration has stated that
it is committed to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles.

The committee will, as stated in the April 14, 1994 notice, include representatives from state and local governments;
the automobile industry and related parties; labor; transportation fuels; and public interest groups, including
the driving public. Thirty individuals have been tentatively selected to be members of the committee, though any
formal appointments will be subject to final checks on availability and other issues. It is contemplated that these
checks will be completed prior to the committee's first meeting on September 28. Announcement of the full committee
membership will be made as soon as all members are appointed.
