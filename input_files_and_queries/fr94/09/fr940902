SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule increases the current minimum size requirements for kiwifruit grown in California and for kiwifruit
imported into the United States that are shipped to the fresh market. The minimum size requirement is increasing from
Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per
8-pound sample. This rule will prevent shipments of low-quality, undersized kiwifruit from having a negative effect
on the market.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 920 [7 CFR Part 920], as amended, regulating the handling of kiwifruit
grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified commodities,
including kiwifruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United
States are prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements as
those in effect for the domestically produced commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 65 handlers subject to regulation under the order and about 600 producers of California kiwifruit.
There are approximately 75 importers of kiwifruit. Small agricultural service firms, which include kiwifruit handlers
and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than
$500,000. A majority of these handlers, importers, and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the marketing order, fresh market shipments of California kiwifruit are required to be inspected
and are subject to grade, size, maturity, pack, and container requirements. Current requirements include specifications
that such shipments be at least Size 49, grade at least KAC No. 1 quality, and contain a minimum of 6.5 percent soluble
solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production of California kiwifruit for the 1993 season was approximately 12.3 million tray equivalents, compared
to the 1992 season production of 13.3 million tray equivalents. This represents an 8 percent decrease in California
kiwifruit production from 1992 to 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Kiwifruit Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing
order, met on February 10, 1994, and recommended increasing the minimum size requirement from Size 49, which is defined
as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The marketing order authorizes under &sect;920.52(a)(2) the establishment of minimum size requirements. &sect;920.302(a)(2)
of the rules and regulations outlines the minimum size requirements for fresh shipments of California kiwifruit.
Section 920.302(a)(4)(ii) includes a table that specifies numerical size designations that are used to determine
kiwifruit sizes. These size designations are defined by numerical counts, which establish the maximum number of
fruit per 8-pound sample for each of the established sizes. The size designation table defines ten different sizes,
beginning with Size 21 (the largest size) and ending with Size 49 (the smallest size). The committee recommended eliminating
the Size 49 designation (60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample) and redefining the Size 45/46 designation (57 pieces
of fruit per 8-pound sample) as a Size 45 designation (55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended increasing the minimum size requirement because of the blending and packing of undersized
fruit into containers using the Size 49 designation. Current pack requirements specify that kiwifruit designated
as Size 45/46 or below must be packed within a 1/4 inch size tolerance. Undersized fruit (Size 49 kiwifruit near or below
the lower limit of the size tolerance) is often blended into the Size 49 designation. It is a common practice throughout
the industry to blend and pack kiwifruit that could be designated as either undersized fruit, Size 49, or Size 45/46
into a Size 49 container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blending occurs because adjoining size designations have size tolerances that partially overlap and kiwifruit
within either size tolerance may be packed in either size designation. For example, the current Size 49 designation
and the current Size 45/46 designation have only a 3-count difference per 8-pound sample. This amounts to only a 0.12
ounce difference per individual fruit. The equipment and time needed to detect such a difference when packing individual
fruit would be cost prohibitive, so instead, handlers choose to blend sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blending has become more prevalent in recent years because a greater percentage of kiwifruit is being packed in volume-fill
or bulk containers in which the fruit is packed ``loosely'' instead of in containers with molded trays. Without the
constraints of a molded tray, there is more freedom to blend sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee's intention in recommending this increase in the minimum size requirement is to eliminate shipments
of undersized fruit that is blended into the Size 49 designation. This undersized kiwifruit tends to soften more rapidly
during storage than larger fruit and becomes more susceptible to decay. This tendency for undersized fruit to soften
more rapidly than larger fruit becomes more pronounced once it leaves a controlled environment and enters an uncontrolled
one such as a retail shelf. The end result is that the consumer is more likely to encounter quality defects with undersized
fruit then with larger fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminating fresh shipments of undersized fruit by increasing the minimum size requirement improves overall quality
and increases uniformity of pack size. The consumer benefits by being offered a higher quality kiwifruit that ripens
properly without prematurely shriveling or softening. Also, grower returns are expected to increase due to less
repack loss, better kiwifruit movement, and higher prices because of a better quality product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also ample evidence to show that the market is adverse to smaller sizes. The California Kiwifruit Commission
(commission) funded an independent survey titled ``Fresh Kiwifruit: Views from the Trade,'' in 1993. This survey
indicated that 30% of the trade rejects small sizes and that 86.1% of the trade prefers Size 42 (defined as 50 pieces
of fruit per 8-pound sample) or larger. Also, 92.1% of the merchandisers and produce managers claim that their customers
reject small sizes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An example of how consumers reject smaller sizes is when kiwifruit is sold at the retail level out of 125 pound bulk bins.
Consumers initially pick out the largest and higher quality kiwifruit, and displays are left with undersized and
low quality kiwifruit that is rejected by later consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee's recommendation that the minimum size requirement be set at Size 45 will not significantly lower the
volume of kiwifruit available in the fresh market. Although the committee reports that 12.1% of the California kiwifruit
packout for the 1993/94 season was designated as Size 49, most of this total could be blended into the Size 45 designation
because of the small difference between the two size designations. The practice of blending sizes makes it difficult
to predict how much fruit will be eliminated by this rule, however, the committee estimates that the total packout
will be reduced by only 1%. In addition, growers could adjust pruning, thinning, fertilizing, and irrigation techniques
so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit will meet the higher size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is general agreement in the industry for the need to eliminate the packing of undersize fruit. Other alternatives
have been suggested to eliminate shipments of low quality, undersized fruit, but would not adequately address the
problem. One suggestion was to eliminate the blending of sizes by eliminating the size tolerances. This is not a realistic
alternative, because as mentioned earlier, it would be cost prohibitive and impossible to achieve using today's
packing methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another suggestion was to measure size by passing a fruit through a template with an opening large enough for an undersized
fruit to fall through, but too small for a kiwifruit that meets the minimum size requirement to fall through. This template
would be used to determine whether a fruit was undersized. However, this alternative does not take into consideration
that kiwifruit grows in different shapes so that a heavier fruit that is short and broad could fall through a template
while a lighter fruit that is long and narrow would not. Weight is currently used to measure size and is the most accurate
measure of a kiwifruit's size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative presented at the meeting was to tighten the maturity requirements rather than the size standards
so that undersized, immature fruit would not be shipped. However, not all undersized fruit is immature, but undersized
fruit does tend to be more susceptible to quality problems. Thus, this alternative would not fully address the problem
of blending in undersized fruit of inferior quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, another alternative presented at the meeting was to establish Size 45 as the minimum size, but continue to
define it as 57 pieces of fruit instead of 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample as recommended by the committee. However,
because of the approximately 0.12 ounce difference between a Size 45 kiwifruit defined as 57 pieces of fruit per 8-pound
sample and a Size 49 kiwifruit defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, this alternative would not go far enough
to prevent the blending of undersized fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8e of the Act provides that when certain domestically produced commodities, including kiwifruit, are regulated
under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality,
and maturity requirements. Since this rule increases the minimum size requirement under the domestic handling regulations,
a corresponding change to the import regulations must also be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for kiwifruit imported into the United States are currently
in effect under &sect;944.550 (7 CFR 944.550). The minimum size requirement is specified in paragraph (a) of &sect;944.550.
This rule increases the minimum size requirement for imported kiwifruit from Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces
of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the minimum size requirement for importers of kiwifruit will also have a beneficial impact. This rule
eliminates quality problems associated with undersized imported kiwifruit as it will for undersized domestic kiwifruit.
In addition, the domestic trade's preference for larger size kiwifruit applies to imported kiwifruit as well as domestic
kiwifruit. Thus, importers will benefit by improving the overall quality of kiwifruit shipments and increasing
sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the June 29, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 33451], with a 30-day comment period ending July 29, 1994. Two comments were received, one in favor and the other
in opposition to the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Committee and reiterated the arguments made in the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second comment was submitted by a grower, Gregory W. Davis, who opposed the proposed rule. Mr Davis commented that
in his view the rule is a volume control measure that forces growers to dump marketable kiwifruit. This rule is not a
volume control measure. Its intention is to eliminate the blending of undersized fruit. In addition, growers retain
the option of adjusting their cultural practices so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit will meet the new size requirement.
Also, the order does not force growers or handlers to dump fruit. The following outlets are exempt from grade, size,
maturity, quality, inspection, and container requirements including: (1) Shipments of less than 200 pounds per
day; (2) roadside stands; (3) Certified Farmers Markets; (4) charitable institutions; (5) relief agencies; and
(6) commercial processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis also commented that growers in his district (District 7) are against increasing the minimum size requirement
and that District 7, which includes Tulare and Inyo counties in Central California, represents almost one-third
of California kiwifruit production. However, some District 7 committee members and alternates, who like all members
of the committee were elected by growers from their District, voted in favor of increasing the minimum size requirement
in the various subcommittee and committee meetings that took place this past year. A committee member from District
7 reported at the February 10, 1994, meeting that a majority of growers were against increasing the minimum size requirement,
but almost all growers were in favor of eliminating the blending of undersize fruit. After a long, thorough, and publicized
debate, the committee determined that increasing the minimum size to Size 45 from Size 49 is the best way to eliminate
the blending of undersize fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis also commented that a redistricting scheduled for next year might change the vote on the minimum size requirement.
The Department has yet to receive a formal recommendation from the committee on this issue. It is premature to assume
that any redistricting will take place or that a newly seated committee would vote any differently on a minimum size
requirement. The present committee was nominated by growers and appointed by the Secretary according to marketing
order procedures. If a redistricting plan is recommended and approved, and if a new committee is selected, then that
committee may recommend revisions to the minimum size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis' comment further stated that since the recommendation was made on February 10, 1994, he and other growers
did not have sufficient time to adjust their cultural practices so that a higher percentage of the 1994 crop will meet
the higher size requirement. However, Mr. Davis indicates that he was present at the subcommittee meeting held in
Modesto, California on December 8, 1993, in which the subcommittee initially recommended increasing the minimum
size requirement. In addition, the January 1994 bulletin of California Kiwifruit, which is jointly produced by the
commission and the committee, announced the December 8, 1993, subcommittee's preliminary recommendation to increase
the minimum size requirement. This publication is mailed to all known kiwifruit growers. Finally, other kiwifruit
growers indicate that cultural practices, such as thinning, are available during February or later to increase kiwifruit
size so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit meet the new size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Davis' comment went on to question the wisdom of preventing shipments of kiwifruit that he considers to be of good
quality. However, quality is a term that is often defined by changing consumers preferences. The independent survey
funded by the commission is an attempt to identify current consumer preferences and clearly shows that many consumers
are adverse to smaller sizes. It is reasonable to require kiwifruit shipments to meet customer preferences for larger
sizes. Otherwise, California kiwifruit will not be as marketable as kiwifruit from international competitors who
meet customer preferences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Mr. Davis suggested that the committee lacked formal research that shows Size 49 or smaller kiwifruit is
not of good quality. As mentioned earlier, the independent market survey does show an overwhelming trade preference
for sizes 42 or larger. Although no formal research was specifically conducted on customer preference for Size 49
kiwifruit or smaller kiwifruit, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience among growers about the
marketing of kiwifruit. It is the view of a majority of committee members, which is made up of growers, that shipments
of undersized kiwifruit have been poorly received by consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After thoroughly analyzing the comments received and other available information, the Department has concluded
that this final rule is appropriate.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) amends its regulations governing who will decide appeals of formal size
determinations and appeals of Standard Industrial Classification code designations authorized under its regulations.
Instead of a three-judge panel at SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), these appeals will now be decided by a
single administrative judge at OHA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA is committed to enhancing its delivery of services to the small business community which it serves. SBA is in the
process of changing its structure to move resources to SBA's various district offices to better serve small businesses.
This restructuring includes SBA's OHA, which has lost several administrative judges to other offices within SBA
or to retirement. Currently, SBA's size regulations authorize a three-judge panel within OHA to decide appeals of
formal size determinations and appeals of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code designations assigned
to certain Government contracts. The assignment of a three judge panel to hear and decide these appeals is no longer
feasible with the reduction in the number of judges at OHA. This final regulation will change the requirement that
a three-judge panel decide size and SIC code appeals to a single administrative judge. It will also change other references
to such a ``panel'' in 13 CFR 121.1701 through 121.1722 to an administrative judge or the Presiding Judge instead.
Because this provision is a procedural rule, it is adopted as a final rule without the necessity of a proposed rule and
an opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.),
and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA certifies that this final rule will not be considered a significant rule within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 and will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule merely changes who will resolve size and SIC code appeals under SBA's regulations. It does not otherwise
affect these appeals, and has no bearing on the number of appeals brought or the contracting actions underlying the
appeals. It will have no effect on the amount or dollar value of any Government contract requirement or the number of
requirements that are subject to SBA's size and SIC code regulations. As such, it is not likely to have an annual economic
effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on
competition or the United States economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this final rule contains no new reporting
or recordkeeping requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule does not have any federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance
with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1993, the President ordered a review of U.S. policy regarding the domestic use of, and export controls on,
encryption technology. That review resulted in a determination that vital U.S. interests_national security, economic,
and law enforcement_compel maintaining appropriate control of encryption. It also revealed that there are measures
which can be taken to reform the existing export controls to ensure that controls are not unduly burdensome to U.S.
exporters. On February 4, 1994, the Department of State announced reforms to the export control procedures applicable
to products incorporating encryption technology.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule implements one of these reforms. Previously, almost every encryption export required an individual
license. Only those exports covered by a distribution arrangement could be shipped without an individual license.
This final rule, which adds a &sect;124.15 to the ITAR, provides for a licensing procedure which permits direct distribution
from the U.S. manufacturer, thus reducing the regulatory burden on exporters without a foreign distributor. The
number of individual license applications required will also be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this new licensing arrangement, U.S. encryption manufacturers may ship their products covered in Category
XIII(b)(1) from the United States directly to customers within approved countries without obtaining individual
licenses for each end user. The procedures are similar to existing distribution agreement procedures. Exporters
are required to submit a proposed arrangement identifying, among other things, specific items to be shipped, proposed
end users and end use and countries to which the items are destined. Upon approval of the arrangement, exporters will
be permitted to ship the specified products directly to end users in the approved countries based on a single license.
Therefore, manufacturers of products covered in Category XIII(b)(1) will now have the option to export to foreign
distributors under a distribution agreement or directly from the U.S. under the new arrangement.

immediately by publication of a final rule. Notwithstanding this final rule, public comment is welcomed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Parole Commission is adopting a rule that permits parole hearings for eligible federal prisoners to be conducted
by a single hearing examiner. Formerly, parole hearings were conducted by panels of two examiners, with single-examiner
hearings being the exception. The final rule issued today makes single examiner hearings the norm, with the Commission
having the option to order panel hearings when appropriate. Review and voting by the Regional Administrator will
provide the Regional Commissioner with a panel recommendation of two examiners before a decision is rendered. The
rule will also permit a hearing examiner (or panel) to withhold the recommended decision that is usually given to the
prisoner at the conclusion of a parole hearing, if a critical issue requires further consideration. The purpose served
by this final rule is to adjust the Commission's procedures to the down-sizing requirements of the Commission's impending
abolition, without lessening the quality of justice in parole hearings and decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public comment was solicited by publication of an interim rule at 47 FR 11186 (March 10, 1994). Comment was received
from the University of Southern California Law Center (USCLC), the Federal Public Defenders for the Central District
of California and the Western District of Pennsylvania, and several federal prisoners. This comment was uniformly
negative, and emphasized the aura of fairness that is assertedly lost when parole hearings are conducted by a single
examiner. Moreover, the public comment advanced various legal arguments to the effect that due process, and the intent
of Congress in the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, mandate the Commission to continue conducting
parole hearings with panels of two examiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the constitutional and legal arguments advanced in the public comment, the Commission has rejected
those arguments. Contrary to the public comment from the USCLC, the legislative history to the 1986 amendment to 18
U.S.C. &sect;4208 clearly states that Congress intended the Parole Commission to ``utilize its resources most efficiently''
by having one examiner conduct the parole hearing, with the second examiner reviewing the case on the record. 132 Cong.
Rec. H11291, 11293 (daily ed. Oct. 17, 1986) (remarks of Rep. Berman). Moreover, the analogy drawn in the public comment
between the right of a parolee to due process under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Morrissey v. Brewer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
408 U.S. 470 (1972), and the right of an eligible prisoner to a parole hearing, is not a correct analogy. A parole hearing
is not designed to test the credibility of live witnesses, but serves the limited purposes of providing the prisoner
with an opportunity: (1) to ensure that the records under consideration by the Parole Commission are, in fact, the
records relating to his case; and (2) to present any special considerations demonstrating why he is an appropriate
candidate for parole. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
442 U.S. 1, 15 (1979). Even under the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976, single-examiner hearings
were permitted in special situations, thus precluding the assumption, advocated in the public comment, that Congress
made a two-examiner panel a legal necessity regardless of the circumstances. The 1976 law also permitted parole revocation
hearings under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to be conducted by a single examiner. Hence, the arguments that the Parole Commission is precluded by law from responding
to the circumstances created by its abolition in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, are without merit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the Parole Commission is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the prisoners themselves for maintaining
the fairness of parole consideration, especially with regard to the deliberations that precede the panel recommendation
to the Regional Commissioner. To this end, the Commission will institute every reasonable measure to ensure thorough
consideration by the Regional Administrator, who will participate as a panel member in arriving at a well-considered,
independent evaluation of the prisoner's case. Although the presence of two hearing examiners provides an eligible
prisoner with the outward assurance of fairness, the ultimate fairness of the deliberations that go into a parole
decision is not diminished if the absent secondary examiner is given more opportunity for reflection and study of
the case file in the regional office, than would be possible when examiners are obliged to complete a docket of hearings
in an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the restraints imposed upon the U.S. Parole Commission by its impending abolition on November 1, 1997, require
that the Commission balance the objective of a fair parole hearing with the need for appropriate conservation of limited
staff resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment was also received with regard to the provision permitting an examiner to forego the recommended decision
normally announced at the conclusion of a parole hearing. The Commission agrees that this should be an extraordinary
procedure, and should not be invoked by hearing examiners on a routine basis. The Commission will monitor the practices
of its hearing examiners to ensure that overuse of this provision (as predicted in some of the public comment) will
not occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Parole Commission has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of
Executive Order 12866 and the rule has therefore not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule
will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities, within the meaning of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

(a) There is hereby delegated to hearing examiners the authority necessary to conduct hearings and to make recommendations
relative to the grant or denial of parole or reparole, revocation or reinstatement of parole or mandatory release,
and conditions of parole. Any hearing may be conducted by a single examiner or by a panel of examiners. A Regional Administrator
shall function as a hearing examiner for the purpose of obtaining a panel recommendation whenever the Regional Commissioner
has not ordered that a hearing be conducted by a panel of two examiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The concurrence of two hearing examiners, or of a hearing examiner and the Regional Administrator, shall be required
to obtain a panel recommendation to the Regional Commissioner. A panel recommendation is required in each case decided
by a Regional Commissioner after the holding of a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An examiner panel recommendation consists of two concurring examiner votes. In the event of divergent votes,
the case shall be referred to another hearing examiner (or to the Regional Administrator in the case of a hearing conducted
by a panel of examiners) for another vote. If concurring votes do not result from such a referral, the case shall be referred
to any available hearing examiner until a panel recommendation is obtained.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 6, 1993, Congress enacted section 9 of Public Law 103&hyph;94, titled Garnishment of Federal Employees'
Pay. This law is a limited waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity to permit pay from an agency to an employee
to be garnished by state and local garnishment orders, subject to certain limitations. Child support garnishment
is already covered by other Federal law. On February 3, 1994, the President signed Executive Order 12897, which delegated
responsibility to the Postal Service to issue implementing regulations for its employees and for the employees of
the Postal Rate Commission. These regulations are in accordance with this delegation of authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service is designating one Authorized Agent to receive garnishment orders under section 9 of Public Law
103&hyph;94. This Federal law supersedes state law with regard to service of garnishment process. Accordingly,
regardless of state law, legal process must be sent directly to, or served in person upon, the Authorized Agent named
in these regulations. There will be only one agent for receipt of process for all garnishments of an employee's pay
arising under state law. Other Postal Service employees are not authorized to receive process nor are they permitted
to transmit process to the Authorized Agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This waiver of immunity for the garnishment process confers jurisdiction only over an employee's pay, and does not
confer jurisdiction over the Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission as a party to a lawsuit, nor does it waive
immunity for the purpose of orders to show cause or for sanctions such as default judgments. These regulations also
announce a change in the agent for service of process for child support garnishments pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 659 and supersede
the designations at 5 CFR 581 Appendix A III of agents to accept service of process on behalf of the United States Postal
Service and the Postal Rate Commission in child support and/or alimony garnishments.

Notwithstanding the designation, in &sect;2.2 of this title, of the General Counsel as agent for the receipt of legal
process against the Postal Service, the sole agent for service of garnishment process directed to the pay of Postal
Service employees and employees of the Postal Rate Commission (``employees'') is the Manager, Payroll Processing
Branch, 1 Federal Drive, Ft. Snelling, MN 55111&hyph;9650 (``Authorized Agent''). The Authorized Agent shall have
sole authority to receive service of legal process in the nature of garnishment (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as ``process'') arising under the law of any state, territory, or possession, or the order of a court of competent
jurisdiction of any state, territory, or possession (including any order for child support and alimony). No process
shall be effectively served until it is received by the office of the Authorized Agent. No other employee shall have
the authority to accept service of such process. Service of process in conformity with Rule 4(i) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure is not waived for any suit or action wherein the Postal Service, its officers, or employees are parties.

Service of process on the Authorized Agent may be made in person or by certified or registered mail, with return receipt
requested, at the address of the Authorized Agent. Service may also be made on the Authorized Agent by means of any private
delivery service pursuant to its authority for the private carriage of letters under an exception to the Private Express
Statutes, 39 U.S.C. 601&hyph;606, provided that the private delivery organization issues a receipt bearing the
name and address of both the addressee and sender, as well as the date of delivery and the signature of the receiving
agent. No garnishment is effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent regardless of the chosen
mode of delivery. Process addressed to, delivered to, or in any manner given to any employee, other than the Authorized
Agent, may, at the sole discretion of the employee, be returned to the issuing court marked ``Not Effectively Served.''
A copy of or reference to these regulations may be included. Employees are not authorized to redirect or forward garnishment
process to the Authorized Agent. In the event that the address of the Authorized Agent is changed, mail may be forwarded
from his or her last published address to the new official address until such time as these regulations are amended
to reflect the new address.

No document purporting to garnish employee wages shall be deemed sufficient unless it can be determined from the face

or an authorized official pursuant to an order of such a court or pursuant to state or local law, evidenced by a signature
of the issuing person; and that it contains the name of the garnished party, with his or her social security number,
orders the employing agency to withhold from pay a specific amount of money, specifically describes the judgment
of debt or administrative action complete with statutory citation and contains specific advice as to where to send
the funds withheld including the complete ZIP Code (ZIP+4). Documents deficient in any of these respects may be returned
to the issuing court or authorized official inscribed ``Insufficient as to legal form.''

with the name and social security number on the garnishment will not be processed. An exact match of both name and social
security number is required in order to permit processing; otherwise, the garnishment will be returned marked ``Insufficient
identifying information.'' Garnishments that are insufficient in regard to identifying information will not be
held pending receipt of further information.

shall respond, in writing, to the garnishment or interrogatories within 30 days of receipt of process. The Authorized
Agent may respond within a longer period of time as may be prescribed by applicable state Law. Neither the Authorized
Agent nor any employee shall be required to respond in person to any garnishment served according to the provisions
of 5 U.S.C. 5520a and the regulations in this section.

No employee whose duties include responding to interrogatories to garnishments shall release information in response
to a garnishment until it is determined that sufficient information, as required in &sect;491.4 above, has been received
in writing as part of the garnishment legal process. The Authorized Agent may, at his or her sole discretion, accept
or initiate telephone inquiries concerning garnishments. No other employee may release any information about employees
except in conformity with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the regulations in 39 CFR part 266, Privacy of Information.

All legal process in the nature of garnishment shall be date- and time-stamped by the Authorized Agent when received
for the purpose of determining the order of receipt of process that is sufficient as to legal form and contains sufficient
information for identification of the employee, the Authorized Agent's date- and time-stamp shall be conclusive
evidence. Child support and alimony garnishments will be accorded priority over commercial garnishments under
5 U.S.C. 5520a as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5520a(h)(2). Garnishments shall be executed if the pay cycle is open for input
or, if closed, will be held until the next cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the final rule regarding retrofit/rebuild requirements for 1993 and earlier model year urban buses (58 FR 21359,
April 21, 1993), EPA stated that it would review retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1994 and publish
the post-rebuild particulate matter emission levels for urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild
levels are to be used by operators for calculating their fleet emission levels under Option 2. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 document fulfills that commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As of July 1, 1994, no equipment had been certified for the Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program. Operators choosing
to comply with Option 2 during 1995 and 1996 must use the PM levels as specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild
PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild PM level'' in the table provided at 40 CFR &sect;85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A).

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 219(d) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to promulgate regulations that require certain 1993 and earlier model
year urban buses having engines, which are replaced or rebuilt after January 1, 1995, comply with an emission standard
or control technology reflecting the best retrofit technology and maintenance practices reasonably achievable.
On April 21, 1993, EPA published final Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses
(58 FR 21359). The Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program requires affected operators of urban buses to choose between
two compliance options. Option 1 establishes particulate matter (PM) emissions requirements for each urban bus
in an operator's fleet whose engine is rebuilt or replaced. Option 2 is a fleet averaging program that sets out specific
annual target levels for average PM emissions from urban buses in an operator's fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, EPA stated that it would review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1, 1994, and publish the post-rebuild PM emission levels for
urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild levels are to be used by operators choosing to comply
with Option 2 for calculating their fleet emission levels. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document fulfills that commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No equipment had been certified as of July 1, 1994. This notice therefore confirms that the default provisions of the
final rule that are designed to assure emissions reduction for the program shall be effective for the first two years
of the program, 1995 and 1996. Emission levels that are to be used in the event that no equipment is certified by July
1994 are set forth in the table provided at 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) of the regulations promulgated in the April
1993 final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the April 21, 1993 final rulemaking stated that EPA intended to publish in this notice a table indicating
required post-rebuild PM emission levels for all affected urban buses. EPA also stated that it would append its determination
regarding post-rebuild emission levels to the CFR as an appendix to part 85 subpart O (the subpart of the CFR containing
the urban bus retrofit/rebuild regulations). However, because no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994, the default
post-rebuild emission levels, which are already contained in the regulation, will apply. Thus, EPA believes that
there is no need to add an appendix to subpart O at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1996, EPA will review the retrofit/rebuild equipment certified by July 1, 1996 and publish the emission levels
which must be used by operators using Option 2 for calendar years 1997 and thereafter.

II. Review of Certified Equipment and Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994 as meeting the emissions and cost requirements for the urban
bus retrofit/rebuild program. Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(B)(5), operators choosing to
comply with Option 2 must use the PM levels specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild
PM level'' in the table provided at &sect;85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) for calculating the target level for their fleet
(TLF). The determination of whether to use the pre-rebuild emission level or the post-rebuild emission level must
be made in accordance with 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An urban bus operator choosing Option 2 must be able to demonstrate that its fleet level attained (FLA) is equal to or
less than its TLF. In general, an operator choosing Option 2 has the following strategies available to comply with
this requirement:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For 1979 through 1987 model year Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) 6V92TA engines, using the currently available
DDC Coach Upgrade Program (kit), discussed below, which brings these engines to a configuration certified for model
years 1988 or 1989; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Replacing engines in affected urban buses with 1994 or later model year engines certified under EPA's new engine
certification program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Retiring urban buses early (that is, retiring 1993 and earlier model year urban buses before they are 15 years old);
and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Using grandfathering provisions contained in 40 CFR 85.1403(d) if the fleet contains urban buses retrofit before
January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should be aware of the following important aspects of Option 2 during the first two years of this program.
First, operators with urban buses in their fleet having model year 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA engines must reduce
average fleet PM emissions during calendar years 1995 and 1996. This is because the calculations for the TLF assume
that engines of the 1984, 1985, and 1987 model years will be rebuilt in calendar years 1995 and 1996, and because the
post-rebuild PM level for the DDC 6V92TA engines of the specified model years have a default level (0.30 g/bhp-hr)
that is less that its pre-rebuild emissions level (0.50 g/bhp-hr). Therefore, for operators with urban buses in their
fleet having model year 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA engines, one or more of the above strategies must be used as necessary
to demonstrate that its FLA is equal to or less than its TLF. (The calculations for the TLF assume that urban buses with
engines of model year 1986 will not receive any rebuilds during calendar years 1995 or 1996. Therefore, for 1986 model
year engines the post-rebuild level is equal to the pre-rebuild level for calendar years 1995 and 1996.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in (2) above, for operators choosing Option 2 who have model 1984, 1985, or 1987 DDC 6V92TA urban buses in their
fleet, use of the DDC upgrade kit is an available, but not required strategy to meet the fleet average reductions required
under Option 2. DDC's upgrade kit will provide additional flexibility to fleets having the above-mentioned DDC engines
without necessitating use of the other, perhaps less desirable, strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the table of 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A), the post-rebuild level is lower than the pre-rebuild level for the 1979
through 1987 6V92TA engines because there is a currently available upgrade kit that is supported by new engine certification
data on file with EPA. At the time of the final rulemaking, EPA expected that DDC's Coach Upgrade kit would be certified
by July 1, 1994 under the retrofit/rebuild program for less than the appropriate cost ceiling. While as of July 1, 1994,
the Coach Upgrade kit had not been certified under the retrofit/rebuild program, EPA believes that it is reasonable
to provide a lower post-rebuild emission level to any applicable engine equipped with this DDC upgrade kit because
of the existence of new engine certification data which shows that engines virtually identical to the upgraded engines
were certified by EPA to the lower emission level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA originally intended that the ``Post-rebuild level'' specified in the table of 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A)
for the 1979 through 1987 model year 6V92TA engines to reflect the level attained when those engines are upgraded to
their latest certified, mechanically-controlled configuration (1988 or 1989 model year configuration depending
upon horsepower). After the final rule was published, it was discovered that the 1988 and 1989 model year 6V92TA engines
were certified to 0.31 g/bhp-hr under the new engine certification program, and not 0.30 g/bhp-hr as shown in the table.
Therefore, 0.31 g/bhp-hr is the level actually achieved by upgrading the 1979 through 1987 model year 6V92TA engines
to the 1988 or 1989 configuration that is certified under EPA's new engine certification program. Because of the error
in the final regulations, EPA will allow urban bus operators to claim a reduction down to the 0.30 g/bhp-hr level when
these engines are upgraded to the appropriate 1988 or 1989 configuration using the DDC Coach Upgrade kit. This will
allow urban bus operators to upgrade their engines as one method of complying with Option 2, as was EPA's original intention.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``grandfathering'' provisions of &sect;85.1403(d)(3) allow operators having urban buses equipped with upgrade
kits installed prior to January 1, 1995 to assume that such urban buses are operating at the PM level of the upgraded
engine configuration. Further, EPA believes it is reasonable to extend the ``grandfathering'' provisions beyond
January 1, 1995 for use of the DDC upgrade kit until appropriate equipment is certified, as discussed below, for the
DDC 6V92TA engines. Operators, however, should note that ``grandfathering'' provisions do not require either the
emissions defect or emissions performance warranties which are required of certified equipment under &sect;85.1409
of the program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, permission to retrofit/rebuild with uncertified equipment to meet program requirements applies to a limited
population of engines (that is, the 1979 through 1989 model year 6V92TA engines having mechanical fuel injection)
for a limited time frame (the 1995 and 1996 calendar years). If equipment is certified for the above-referenced DDC
engines as achieving the required PM emission reductions for less than the applicable cost ceiling before July 1,
1996, operators will not be able to claim emission reductions for engines rebuilt after calendar years 1995 and 1996
using uncertified equipment. Operators will be able to continue to claim emission reductions for engines which are
rebuilt with the uncertified DDC upgrade kit prior to that time.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces the deletion of the Revere Textile Prints Corporation Superfund
Site in Sterling, Connecticut from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL is Appendix B of the National Oil and
Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of Connecticut
have determined that all appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented and that no further
response is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of Connecticut have determined that remedial actions conducted
under CERCLA at the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

 On November 10, 1993, EPA published a TSCA section 4 final test rule requiring testing of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene
(TMB) (CAS No. 108&hyph;67&hyph;8). After EPA published the final rule, certain manufacturers questioned the scope
of the manufacturers, importers, and processors subject to the test rule. EPA is now clarifying that only manufacturers,
importers, and processors of TMB as an isolated product, and not persons who manufacture, import, or process the substance
as part of complex mixtures or substances, are subject to the final test rule requiring certain health effects testing.

repeated dose and oral 90&hyph;day subchronic toxicity studies on TMB (58 FR 59667). In the preamble to the final rule,
EPA responded to a comment from a manufacturer concerned that the proposed testing program for TMB would cause substantial
economic impact for its company that would likely force it to discontinue sales of this chemical in the United States.
EPA stated in response that the impact will be less than originally noted in the proposal because the cost of the testing
program required by the final rule is less than the testing program proposed originally. In addition, EPA noted that
it believed that the commenter would not be the only company required to test because there are other manufacturers
that might be subject to the test rule, including ``several manufacturers of C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, which contain
1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers of the C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum refiners, challenged EPA's final rule arguing that they
had received inadequate notice that they might be subject to the test rule. After reviewing the record, EPA agrees
that there is some question whether these manufacturers received sufficient notice that they would be subject to
the test rule. As a result, EPA is issuing this Notice to clarify that only manufacturers, importers, and processors
of TMB as an isolated product, and not persons who manufacture, import, or process the substance as part of complex
mixtures or substances, are subject to the final test rule requiring certain health effects testing. This then leaves
open the issue of whether the testing requirements would, if fulfilled, cause the original commenter to suffer a substantial
economic impact. EPA has revisited this issue with the commenter and has been advised that this issue is no longer of
concern because the company has received voluntary contributions to cover some of the testing costs (May 3, 1994 letter
from Koch Industries to EPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that public comment on this clarification is unnecessary because: (1) Nothing in the actual regulation
is being changed and this merely aids in interpretation of the regulation; and (2) to the extent that confusion has
mistakenly led some persons to believe that they are subject to the regulation, this provides relief from that perceived
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, for persons who manufacture, import, and process TMB as an isolated product, the test rule is valid and
applicable to them. EPA is now clarifying that persons, including relevant petroleum refiners, who do not manufacture,
import, or process TMB as an isolated product are not required to submit test data, letters of intent to test, applications
for exemptions, import certifications, or any other item that may be required pursuant to a final test rule under TSCA
section 4. Additionally, only exporters of TMB as an isolated product or as part of mixtures known to contain previously
isolated TMB are subject to the TSCA section 12(b) export notification requirements (40 CFR part 707).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the Department of Labor (DOL) is amending the Job Training Partnership
Act (JTPA) regulations to implement the Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 and related statutes. Through these
final regulations, the Department intends to direct the focus of JTPA training and employment programs on improving
the targeting of JTPA services to those facing serious barriers to employment, enhancing the quality of services
provided and program outcomes, strengthening fiscal and program accountability and the linkage between the services
provided and local labor market needs, and fostering a comprehensive and coherent system of human resource services.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 13, 1982, the President signed into law the Job Training Partnership Act, Public Law 97&hyph;300. The stated
purposes of the Act were ``to establish programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force,
and to afford job training to those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing serious barriers to
employment who are in special need of such training to obtain productive employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of the Act sets forth general requirements for programs, as well as some requirements for State and local operation
of programs. Title II provides requirements for State and local operation of adult and youth programs for the economically
disadvantaged. Title III of the Act provides for operation of State and substate programs of employment and training
assistance for dislocated workers. Title IV provides requirements for special programs for targeted groups, such
as Native Americans, migrant and seasonal farmworkers, and veterans, as well as for the Job Corps and other specialized
programs. Title V provides incentives to States to reduce welfare dependency and increase self-sufficiency for
absent parents of children receiving aid to families of dependent children and blind or disabled individuals receiving
supplemental security income under title XVI of the Social Security Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, among other things, implements statutory requirements under the Job Training Reform Amendments
of 1992 (JTPA Amendments), Public Law 102&hyph;367; the Nontraditional Employment for Women Act (NEW), Public Law
102&hyph;235; the Department of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Defense Authorization Act), Public
Law 102&hyph;484; the Older Americans Act, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;171; the Clean Air Act, Public Law 101&hyph;549;
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Worker Security Act, title V of Public Law 103&hyph;182 and the Goals
2000: Educate America Act, Public Law 103&hyph;227. While the programs are modified pursuant to statutory amendments
and requirements, the delivery system for the JTPA programs under the final rule remains essentially the same as in
pre-Amendment regulations. It does not have the financial or other impact to make it a major rule and, therefore, the
preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is not necessary. See Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor (``DOL'' or ``the Department'') has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business
Administration, that pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the final rule would not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. No significant economic impact would be
imposed on such entities by the final rule.

The Department has conducted this rulemaking in an open and public manner. Since the enactment of the Amendments,
Department officials have responded to numerous invitations to discuss the Amendments with organizations interested
in the Amendments and proposed regulatory action. Additionally, a group of technical experts has offered suggestions
to the Department on the proposed areas for regulatory action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 10, 1992, the Department published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invited comments from interested parties regarding proposed or recommended regulatory actions to be taken by
the Department. 57 FR 41447. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 29, 1992, the Department published an interim final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, providing the opportunity for comment. 57 FR 62004. Amendments to the rule were published on June 3, 1993. 58 FR 31471.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 400 sets of comments were received in response to the interim final rule. Sources of comments by the close of the
comment period were as follows: Private industry councils (99); service delivery areas (72); service providers
(41); States (39); community-based organizations (33); public interest groups (31); State JTPA offices (28); private
contractors (14); State education agencies (10); Federal agencies (8); unions (7); private citizens (7); State
job training coordinating councils (6); members of Congress (2); and other sources (4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, on March 24, 1992, the Department published proposed rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance program under JTPA title III, providing the opportunity to comment.
57 FR 10232. Thirteen sets of comments were received from State, substate entities and other organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department fully considered these comments and other comments received in time to consider in the development
of this final regulation and addresses the issues they raised in the following discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, during the period of May through July, 1994, when this final rule was in development, the Department initiated
a Dialogue with the employment and training community and others interested in the JTPA title II program for the disadvantaged.
This Dialogue was initiated by a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice published on May 18, 1994, and consisted principally of a series of fifteen small group and town hall meetings
and a review of research on employment and training programs with a view to developing an action plan to improve title
II programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Approach to Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations continue to provide substantial responsibility and discretion to States and local areas in developing
policy and in implementing procedures for JTPA programs. Thus, in many instances in these final regulations, responsibility
for certain decisions is vested in the State and in the service delivery areas (SDA's) and substate grantees (SSG's).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has attempted in these final regulations to foster improved customer services by eliminating or reducing
unnecessary programmatic requirements wherever possible so that decisions on how to best serve JTPA customers will
be made, to the maximum extent possible, at the level of customer service and based upon customer need. For example,
some of the restrictions on the duration of certain activities, such as work experience and entry employment experience
where not specifically provided for in the Act, have been eliminated. Rather than Federal regulation, the needs of
the customer as determined in the assessment process and the intervention's likelihood of success in enhancing skills
and achieving long term employment will dictate how the program intervention will be designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This was also a theme from the title II Dialogue. Some of the principal themes suggested by the title II Dialogue were
the following: (1) Greater program flexibility with accountability, (2) Greater support for longer-term training
interventions, including approaches more customized to customer needs and better connections between training
and jobs, (3) Improved coordination at all levels but with special attention to coordination among federal agencies,
(4) Increased supportive services, (5) More streamlining of eligibility, and (6) Better access for community-based
organizations to JTPA planning and service delivery. To the extent permitted by the rulemaking process, the Department
considered the major themes from the Dialogue in this final rule. In several instances, there are changes in this final
rule that are consistent with the themes of the Dialogue. For example, as noted above, certain prior restrictions
have been eliminated; initial efforts to achieve greater coordination with the Departments of Education, Health
and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development are reflected in this final rule; the Department has attempted
to streamline the requirements for providing participants with financial assistance; and these final regulations
clarify that, as appropriate, the new eligibility provisions for youth are applied in the program under section 123
and title II-B. In addition, the Department will reexamine the Eligibility Documentation Technical Assistance
Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), these regulations are limited to those areas
which are specifically required by statute, identified by the Department or the public as necessary to provide guidance
and clarification, or essential to further the purposes of the Act. Additionally, the Department fully intends to
provide strong oversight and monitoring of JTPA programs in conjunction with strengthened State and local oversight
and monitoring. It is through the monitoring of the implementation of the Amendments and these regulations, rather
than through promulgation of prescriptive regulations, that the Department, working with the States and service
delivery and substate areas, will ensure effective program operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of all the consultations and comments the Department has received, about half expressed interest in having the Department
be more detailed in the regulations, and the other half indicated that the Department was being overly prescriptive
in the interim final rule and preferred that the Department provide minimal guidance. The Department reminds readers
of these regulations that the JTPA Amendments create more restrictive operational and programmatic requirements
in order to address a series of issues that had been identified in connection with JTPA. The Department has sought to
strike a balance in these final regulations in terms of guidance and prescriptiveness. In some regulatory areas,
such as some of the administrative requirements, the Department has carefully specified requirements to set a strong
foundation for program integrity so that in other regulatory areas, such as program design, there can be more flexibility
and emphasis on outcomes. Finally, the Department has sought to make these regulations sufficiently clear, so that
all parties with an interest in JTPA understand both the requirements and the areas of flexibility in the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is not a stand-alone document; the companion document is the JTPA, as amended. In several instances,
however, portions of the Act are repeated to make the final rule user-friendly and to facilitate its use as a reference
tool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 1992 JTPA Amendments, the Clean Air Act, section 4467 of the Defense Authorization Act and the NAFTA
Worker Security Act impacted on title III of JTPA. The final regulations in 20 CFR part 631 provide for limited revisions
to existing title III regulations as required by these statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were a number of comments on specific areas of performance standards and related reporting requirements. On
July 11, 1994, the Department published separately in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the final performance standards for PY 1994 and PY 1995. The Department appreciates the issues raised by commenters
on the interim final regulations in the area of performance standards and has taken these comments into account in
developing the performance standards. In addition, on June 23, 1994 the Department issued Training and Employment
Information Notice 5&hyph;93, Change 1 with the revised reporting instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also plans to issue separately revisions to the regulations for title IV, part A, the Employment and
Training Programs for Native Americans and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers. When it does, the contents of the regulations
as reflected herein may change. The Department has issued revised regulations for title IV, part B, the Job Corps.
(58 FR 69098 (December 29, 1993)).

Format of These Final Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The structure, organization, and enumeration of the JTPA regulations have been revised to accommodate the Amendments.
Throughout this document, unless otherwise stated, ``JTPA'' or ``the Act'' refers to the Job Training Partnership
Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); ``Department'' or ``DOL'' refers to the U.S. Department of Labor; and ``Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of
the U.S. Department of Labor or the Secretary's designated representative(s). As used in these final regulations,
the term ``title'' refers to a title of the Job Training Partnership Act, unless the text specifically refers to another
statute. The terms ``section'', ``part'', and ``subpart'' refer to a section, part, and subpart, respectively,
of these final regulations, unless the text specifically refers to another document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified at PART 626_Introduction To The Regulations Under The Job Training Partnership Act, part 627 applies
to all programs under titles I, II, and III of the Act, except where noted, and part 628 generally applies to title II
programs. Parts 629 and 630 are reserved for future use. Part 631 continues to apply to title III programs and part 637
has been revised for the title V Jobs for Employable Dependent Individuals (JEDI) program. Therefore, various sections
that previously appeared in parts 627, 628, 629, and 630 have been redesignated to parts 627 and 628.

The interim final rule at &sect;626.5 added a significant number of definitions of terms used throughout the JTPA
and regulations. Definitions of the terms ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'', ``family'',
``family income'', ``obligations'', ``stand-in costs'', and ``vendor'' received the most comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Commercially available off-the-shelf training package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the outset, the wording of the term being defined is changed. In the interim final rule the term was ``commercially
available or off-the-shelf training packages;'' in the final rule, the word ``or'' is dropped so that the term being
defined reads ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages''. The reason for this change is that both
the Act and the definition require that a training package be both commercially available and available at off-the-shelf
prices. Practically, availability at off-the-shelf prices is subsumed within the broader concept of commercial
availability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters submitted comments on the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'',
contained in &sect;626.5. The basis of this definition is the definition of a commercial product found in part 15 of
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). First of all, the Department acknowledges that there is a degree of uncertainty
regarding which training packages and their providers fall within the meaning of commercially available off-the-shelf.
The term, as defined within &sect;626.5, relies generally upon whether the package is provided in a commercial market
in which it is available to the public. This was the origin of the language ``sold to the public'' and that related to
``catalogue or market prices''. These business concepts are indicators of the training package's availability
to the public, e.g., a catalogue available to the public or a public, advertised price shows that the entity is seeking
to engage in commerce. The Department believes that most parties understand the basic meaning of whether any package
is ``commercially available.'' Some related areas of the definition are discussed further below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second area of inquiry pertains to the contents of the package. The training will consist of classroom and related
practical instruction, which may include hands-on experience. It may consist of the development of occupational
or education-related skills. For example, a package may provide occupational training to a participant as a nurse
practitioner, as a maintenance mechanic, or in computer design, in heating, ventilation and air conditioning, or
may provide basic skills in reading and computation. The package may consist of a necessary assessment of interests,
aptitudes, and abilities, as well as counseling and guidance related to participant progress and employment prospects.
Such a training package will not normally consist of the kind of assistance typically provided within the meaning
of a JTPA supportive service, but may include fees, books and other materials needed for participation and completion
of the package. In other words, if an organization offers training to the general public which consists solely of a
practical training course in a particular occupation, it is that course, without any other placement or assessment
services, which may be purchased as a commercially available training package. On the other hand, if the organization
offers assessment or placement services to the public as part of its training course, those services will be a part
of the commercially available package. A key indicator, however, is whether the contents of the package are generally
available and generally the same for all participants, not just JTPA participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, commenters raised questions about the type of entity that might provide the commercially available package.
A variety of entities may be the source of a commercially available package; however, the characteristics of the package,
that is, whether they meet the tests of commercial availability at off-the-shelf prices, are more of an indicator
than the entity that provides it. Such entities may include those that provide computer-based instruction in a variety
of occupational and educational topical areas, or they may be public and private schools, academies or other entities
that offer training that is commercially available, as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that the phrase ``performance criteria'' be defined, and the definition now includes
language that addresses the reference to ``performance criteria''. ``Performance criteria'' may generally fall
into two or more areas that reflect the necessary components and features of the package that is to be delivered, such
as (1) grade requirements, knowledge, skills, and competencies which may be expected to be attained by students,
and (2) where appropriate, participant attainment as manifested by job placement. This latter component is contingent
upon whether the service is regularly offered and may be reasonably included in the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters were concerned with the requirement that the packages be unmodified. They indicated that, in many
instances, a commercially available training package may be modified to some degree to reflect the special needs
of the JTPA population, without changing its basic content. A strict reading of the regulation would prohibit contracting
for commercially available packages which are modified in any way, regardless of whether the package remains substantially
the same. In addition, this strict reading would prohibit the JTPA program from taking advantage of a discounted price
that might be offered in connection with multiple purchases of the package. The Department does not intend that a local
program be prohibited from purchasing a commercially available package at a discounted price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to respond to this comment, the Department further conforms the definition to the concepts in the FAR, and
the word ``unmodified'' is removed. This change recognizes that some modifications may be made to a package to meet
special JTPA requirements, just as a commercial entity would offer to other customers, while the package remains
substantially similar to that regularly offered. A test for whether the package remains substantially the same as
that regularly offered is whether the modification does not involve an increase in the catalogue price. An increase
in catalogue price would indicate that the package is not substantially the same. However, a price decrease due to
such things as volume discounts or good negotiating is not, in itself, indicative of a modified package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another test is whether the same training components continue to be offered in the package. A difference in the training
components would indicate that the package may not be substantially the same. All of these tests should be considered
in determining whether a training package meets the definition. Further, JTPA funds should not be used to make any
modification to a training package. Should training packages be modified in order to conform to JTPA requirements,
they may be considered commercially available off-the-shelf only if they comply with the remaining requirements
listed in the definition. Thus, while some modification is possible, the definition is not intended to include ``customized
training,'' training designed solely to meet the special needs of an individual or group of JTPA participants.

A few commenters asked for a definition of ``substantial'' in regard to the quantities sold. In response, the phrase
``in substantial quantities'' is removed from the definition because the Department believes that the concept is
embodied in the idea of ``being sold to the general public'' which follows in the definition. For further guidance,
the FAR indicates, with respect to being sold in ``substantial quantities'', that ``[N]ominal quantities, such
as models, samples, prototypes, or experimental units, do not meet this requirement.'' Further, there were suggestions
that an amount such as 25 to 30 percent non JTPA sales may be useful to States and SDA's when setting policy in this area.
The definition that is provided conforms to the FAR definition; therefore, it is not being changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wondered if community-based organizations (CBO's) and non-profit organizations were included
within this definition. Such organizations may be among the types of organizations that provide a ``commercially
available off-the-shelf'' training package if the training packages they provide meet the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments reflected confusion about the relationship of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training
packages'' to ``vendors'' and ``subrecipients''. It is important to recognize that the definitions of ``vendor''
and ``subrecipient'' and the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'' exist for
different purposes and should not be viewed as related. An agreement to acquire a commercially available off-the-shelf
training package may create either a vendor or a subrecipient relationship, depending on the content of the package.
If the package contains elements that meet some of the distinguishing characteristics of a subrecipient (see definition),
then a subrecipient relationship is created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of whether a vendor or subrecipient relationship is created, the costs of the commercially available
off-the-shelf training package may be charged entirely to the direct training category. However, other JTPA requirements
such as record retention, audit, etc. do apply to a subrecipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages'' is to provide states
and SDA's broad flexibility to utilize generally available training services and to be able to charge those services
entirely to the training cost category. It will, for example, permit states and SDA's to purchase training from a variety
of educational institutions at off-the-shelf or catalogue prices. It must be recognized, however, that there are
limits to the flexibility that the definition affords. One important limitation is that the definition only applies
to the provision of actual training services to eligible JTPA participants. It does not apply to intermediate administrative
entities or entities that pass funds through to training providers. Another limitation is that the services must
actually be available to and provided to significant numbers of persons or to entities that procure training for such
persons under other state or federal programs outside the JTPA system. It will not be sufficient for a training provider
merely to claim that its services are available to the general public or to other training programs (like the JOBS program).
The state or SDA must be able to show that the services actually are available to the public or to other programs and that
the services are utilized by them. If a training provider has a history of providing training only to the JTPA program
or to JTPA participants, it will not be considered a provider of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training
packages''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not a part of the definition, section 141(d)(3)(A) of the Act also requires that ``commercially available
off the shelf training packages'' be purchased competitively. The requirements for competitive procurement are
covered in the procurement provisions of the regulations at &sect;627.420.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received on the definition of the term ``family'' at &sect;626.5 of the interim final regulations.
In general, the nature of these comments was that: (1) The definition is too restrictive and limits the Governor's
flexibility in defining the term; (2) the definition does not recognize alternative living arrangements that do
not fit neatly into the ``traditional'' concept of a family; and (3) the regulations do not address how to handle other
family members, including dependent adults, living in the same residence. A few of the commenters noted that an apparent
conflict exists in how ``family'' is defined in the interim final regulations and how it is treated in the Standardized
Program Information Report (SPIR) instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``family'' was statutorily defined in the 1992 Amendments for the purposes of income eligibility determination
for receipt of JTPA services. The interim final regulations provide the Governor with flexibility to interpret the
term ``family'' concerning how ``dependent children'' are defined for JTPA programs. The interim final rule also
defines the phrase ``living in a single residence''. The statute established a standard definition to apply consistently
for JTPA programs, which, within the three categories, covers the vast majority of family configurations and living
relationships in the country. The definition is not intended to address every possible permutation of alternative
living arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department believes that the regulations provide the Governor with some latitude in defining the term
``family'', the comments raised an issue regarding the adverse effect of excluding ``dependent adults'' from the
definition, which warrants further consideration. While the Department recognizes that excluding dependent adults
may impact on the eligibility of some family members, the Department does not believe that this circumstance is included
in the statutory definition. The Department does not believe that it has the authority to expand upon the definition
of ``family'' beyond the categories specifically found at section 4 of the Act. No change is made in the final regulations.
Other individuals living in the same residence, who are not dependent children, would be viewed as individuals in
applying for and being determined eligible to receive JTPA services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few of the commenters accurately noted the difference between the definition of ``family'' in the interim final
regulations and the SPIR instructions regarding the treatment of an individual with a disability for the purposes
of eligibility determinations. The SPIR reflects the definition of ``family'' in the regulations in effect prior
to the publication of the December 29, 1992, interim final rule. The definition contained in the interim final regulations
indicate that an individual with a disability ``may'', for the purpose of income eligibility, be considered to be
an unrelated individual who is a family unit of one. This change was an administrative error and should not have been
included in the interim final rule. Accordingly, the definition of ``family'' is amended to revise the word ``may''
to ``shall'' in the final regulations. This amendment is consistent with the provisions at section 4(8) of the Act
defining the term ``economically disadvantaged''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Family Income
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few comments were received on the change in the definition of ``family income'' and the method for calculating such
income for the purposes of determining eligibility for JTPA services. In general, the nature of the comments were
that: (1) The use of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) poverty guidelines appears to conflict with
the definition of ``economically disadvantaged'' at section 4(8) of the Act; (2) the definition does not include
certain payments that have previously been excluded from family income; and (3) the old definition of ``family income''
should be retained, with the Governor defining the term for the purposes of income eligibility determinations, as
has been the case since the inception of JTPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters accurately noted that certain payments that have always been considered to be ``public assistance''
were omitted from the interim final rule. This was an inadvertent oversight in developing the regulations. The definition
of ``family income'' is amended in the final rule to reflect that ``public assistance'' still includes Aid to Families
with Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income, Emergency Assistance money payments, and non-Federal
funded General Assistance or General Relief money payments, which are exclusions from income for the purposes of
income eligibility determinations. In addition, certain other Federal statutes exclude additional types of payments
from JTPA income eligibility determinations. For example, Pell grants are specifically excluded by title IV of the
Higher Education Act, as is income earned while on active military duty and certain other veterans' benefits, identified
at 38 U.S.C. 4213. These exclusions are incorporated into the final rule. There also has been concern expressed regarding
the inclusion of Social Security benefit payments as income in determining eligibility for older individuals. It
has been noted that many older individuals fall just above the income threshold for JTPA because of the inclusion of
Social Security benefits and, therefore, are being denied needed JTPA services. The Department recognizes that
older individuals have special needs which warrant consideration for their participation and inclusion in programs
under JTPA. In the interest of responding to such needs, the Department is amending the regulations in the final rule
to permit the Governor to exclude 25 percent of regular Social Security benefits from family income. The Department
believes that this change will address the concerns of the commenters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters raised the issue that the HHS guidelines include scholarships as income. They expressed concern
that individuals who may receive scholarship assistance based on need, but who are otherwise economically disadvantaged,
would not be eligible for services if such assistance is counted as family income. In addition, they pointed out that
the inclusion of such needs-based assistance would also impact the eligibility of another family member who would
otherwise be eligible for services, regardless of whether the individual receiving such assistance applies for
JTPA services. The Department finds merit in the comments and is amending the definition of ``family income'' to add
``needs-based scholarship assistance'' to the exclusions from family income. To the extent that existing guidance
has been interpreted to require the inclusion of needs-based scholarship assistance as family income, these regulations
supersede any such guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few of the commenters noted that the interim final rule appeared to indicate that only use of the poverty level applied
in determining eligibility. This conflicts with section 4(8) of the Act, which indicates the use of the higher of the
poverty level or 70 percent of the Lower Living Standard Income Level in determining economically disadvantaged
status. The Department acknowledges that the preamble language could be misinterpreted. The reference to the use
of the HHS poverty guidelines as the standard for determining economic disadvantage pertained to the use of the HHS
guidelines to define family income, and not to indicate requirements different from those found at section 4(8) of
the Act. The HHS guidelines, with the exceptions noted in the definition of family income, would be used to determine
income, and that income figure would apply for the purposes of income eligibility determinations under section 4(8)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the several comments received on the term ``obligations'', most commenters were satisfied with the definition
and asked that it not be changed. A few commenters wanted it changed as they believed that, as defined, very little,
if any, funds would be reallotted or reallocated. No change is made to the definition, but the issue of reallotment
is further treated in the discussion of &sect;627.410. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter pointed out that the term ``service provider'' was defined by statute in section 301(b)(3) of the Act.
The definition in these regulations is amended to conform to the statutory definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``stand-in costs'' is revised, along with the regulation at &sect;627.480(f) (which had been paragraph
(g) in the interim final regulation), so that both provide the same criteria as to the time when such costs were incurred
and the cost category to which they are chargeable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other comments were received on the definition of ``vendor'', most of which generally fell into two groups.
One group encouraged referencing the definition of this term contained in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. The other group requested more clarification or examples. A few commenters
raised questions of whether vendor goods or services could be customized, or the extent to which they could be altered,
and still meet the vendor definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is applying the standard Federal Government-wide description of the term ``vendor'', as it already
exists in the audit requirements and related literature of OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. However, A&hyph;128
does not contain a definition of the term ``vendor'' and the A&hyph;133 definition appears to limit the term to providers
of administrative goods and services. For those reasons, and, as explained in the preamble to the interim final rule,
the Department draws upon the Questions and Answers developed by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency
(PCIE) and OMB for its definition. The PCIE document carries the vendor definition beyond administrative goods and
services and provides examples.

With regard to the question on whether vendor goods or services could be customized or modified, the Department believes
that the package may be modified to meet JTPA requirements if the vendor modifies its goods or services for other customers
and if it remains substantially the same as those goods or services regularly offered. An indication of whether vendor
goods or services are substantially the same as those regularly offered is whether the price does not increase when
it is modified. No change is made to the definition in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``published'' is removed in the final rule and the word ``issued'' is substituted. Also, language is added
to indicate that such guidelines, interpretations, and definitions adopted by the Governor are to be those that actually
have been imposed or utilized, consistent with section 124 of the Act. The word ``issued'' is used to better reflect
the purpose of the requirement that the guidelines, interpretations and definitions on which the Governor relies
are to be made public prior to their effective date and to assure that they are actually being used in the administration
of the JTPA programs. How the Governor chooses to inform the public may vary and may depend upon the nature of the action.
It may include means such as issuance of written directives or letters, inclusion in an electronic network or bulletin
board, publishing in a newspaper, or other public announcement in which the effective date is indicated.

Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim final rule, the Department requested comments on the feasibility of authorizing waivers to the JTPA
regulatory requirements. Recently, it has been suggested that some of the administrative burden or unintended effect
of regulatory requirements may be reduced through the granting of waivers_specifically waivers of regulatory requirements.
This was recommended in the recent report of the National Performance Review, ``Creating a Government That Works
Better and Costs Less.'' The Department believes that there is merit in this concept and incorporates a waiver provision
in these regulations. Therefore, a new &sect;627.201 is added which permits the Governor to request, and the Secretary
to approve, waivers of the regulations for up to four years. The request from the Governor must be consistent with the
provisions of the Act and demonstrate how the waiver will meet one of the criteria listed in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absent specific statutory authorization, the Secretary has no authority to waive statutory requirements. The Secretary
may, however, waive provisions of the regulations which expand upon, interpret or explicate statutory requirements.
The new regulation is intended to permit waivers of any regulatory provision as long as the waiver does not affect the
basic statutory requirements and if it is shown that the waiver will improve services, increase skill or educational
attainment, promote coordination or substantially improve the job placement outcomes of the JTPA program. For example,
a State may seek a waiver of the 25% disregard for social security income for older workers since that rule is not mandated
by the Act. To obtain such a waiver, a state would have to demonstrate that it would not reduce services to those most
in need. On the other hand, a state could not obtain a waiver of the regulatory prohibition on using JTPA funds to support
employment generating activities since that regulation simply repeats a clear statutory requirement. In a more
complicated situation, a state could request a waiver of some of the detailed requirements of the procurement regulation
(&sect;617.420) if those requirements conflicted with its own procurement system. In order to obtain such a waiver,
however, the state would have to show that its system adequately addresses all of the minimum requirements listed
in section 164(a)(3) of the Act and that it would promote coordination with other programs or would result in either
better quality services or better employment outcomes if the same procurement system were used by those programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department assumes that the States and SDA's/SSG's are more aware than is DOL of what waivers they may need. Thus,
the Department does not intend to provide immediate general guidance on what waivers may or may not be requested. As
the Department determines which waiver requests it will grant and which waivers lead to greater coordination or better
program results, guidance will be issued to enable the JTPA system to better understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver process and to learn about what practices work.

The JTPA Amendments amended section 167 of the Act to require that the Secretary issue final regulations which would
clarify the application of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of the JTPA and provide uniform
procedures for implementing these provisions. On January 15, 1993, the Directorate of Civil Rights (the DOL agency
responsible for enforcing the various Federal nondiscrimination and equal opportunity statutes applicable to
federally assisted programs) promulgated a final rule to implement the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity
requirements of the JTPA (29 CFR part 34; 58 FR 4742). Throughout these final regulations, all of the Department's
nondiscrimination and equal opportunity regulations (29 CFR parts 31, 32, and 34) are cited since they are all applicable
to JTPA federally assisted programs. In order to eliminate the burden of complying with overlapping regulatory requirements,
29 CFR part 34 provides that compliance by JTPA recipients with part 34 constitutes compliance with the Department's
Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VI regulations (29 CFR part 31) and with specified portions of the Department's Rehabilitation
Act section 504 federally assisted program regulations. 29 CFR part 32, subparts A, C, and E.

A few commenters, in connection with &sect;627.210(a)(3), questioned the cost category to which expenses for ``accessibility''

Cost classification. In addition, a commenter noted that this provision of the regulations should not be construed
to otherwise relieve a recipient or subrecipient from their responsibility under the law to provide for ``accessibility
and ``reasonable accommodation''. The Department agrees and the final rule is modified to indicate that the provision
applies only with regard to needs for the JTPA program.

Section 141(c) of the Act was revised substantially to prohibit the use, or proposal for use, of JTPA funds to induce
or to encourage the relocation of a company when such relocation results in the loss of employment of any employee of
the company at the original site. That section also prohibits certain assistance to any relocating company for the
first 120 days after the company commences operations at the new or expanded location, if the relocation results in
an employee's job loss at the original site. If the Secretary finds that the State, SDA, or substate grantee (SSG) has
violated either provision, fines are levied equal to twice the amount of funds expended. If the State, SDA, or SSG demonstrates
that it neither knew nor reasonably could have known (after an inquiry undertaken with due diligence) that the funds
it provided were expended in violation of these provisions, then only the amount expended is repaid.

Some commenters questioned whether these provisions prevent SDA's/SSG's from placing participants in certain
job openings for a set period of time. The Department believes that they do under circumstances in which there are job
losses in other geographic areas or in which workers are laid off or experience periods of unemployment. By clarifying
and standardizing terms, as well as setting the prohibition on assistance at 120 days, the Act systematizes the administration
of this prohibition on relocation. Most of the comments on the interim final rule pertaining to these provisions focused
on the need for clarification of terms such as ``labor market area'', ``loss of employment'', ``commercial operations'',
``pre-award review'', ``induce'' or ``encourage'', and on the extent of an SDA's due diligence and local liability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.215(c) defines a ``relocating establishment'' as a business entity moving operations ``from a facility
in one labor market area within the United States and its territories to a new or expanding facility in another labor
market area.'' Commenters pointed out that some rural labor market areas may encompass vast areas and several counties.
Section 4(13) of the Act provides a definition of ``labor market area'' as ``an economically integrated geographic
area within which individuals can reside and find employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change employment
without changing their place of residence. Such areas shall be identified in accordance with criteria used by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor in defining such areas or similar criteria established by a Governor.''
The key to the Act's definition is that the labor market area be ``an economically integrated geographic area'' where
an individual can change his or her employment without changing his or her place of residence. Thus, for purposes of
this relocation provision, a large rural SDA could contain more than one labor market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked for a clarification of ``loss of employment''. One stated that when employees at the original
location do not accept relocation job offers and then are laid off, ``loss of employment'' has not occurred. The Department
believes that, in such a situation, loss of employment is presumed when a person no longer has a job with the company
at the original location or with any other entity because of the relocation and the loss of employment at that location
would not otherwise have occurred. This does not include those who would have retired or quit regardless of the relocation,
or those who were fired for cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested further guidance on commencement (or expansion) of commercial operations. The Department
added the term ``commercial'' to the regulations to be consistent with the statutory intent that a viable prohibition
on JTPA assistance in the day-to-day production of goods and services be observed. The term ``commercial'' operations
is intended to further distinguish between the construction and operation stage of a business, as well as to demarcate
the stage when products are being produced for commercial distribution.

Similarly, a number of commenters asked whether ongoing JTPA contracts with a company must be stopped or interrupted
when the company relocates work from another facility. The Department believes any such contracts with the business
within the SDA to which the company has relocated must be ended for the duration of the time work is being relocated,
since ongoing JTPA assistance was not meant to accommodate business needs which are the result of work relocation
from another facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional clarification was also requested on the treatment of relocation scenarios where large retail store chains
close down some sites sequentially and then open others in widely dispersed locations. The Department believes that
the Act only applies to such cases where a company closes a retail store in one location in order to move that retail store's
business to another location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.215(d) requires a pre-award review to be completed to document compliance with section 141(c) of the
Act. Several commenters asked for clarification, and one recommended that the States be responsible for developing
the standardized pre-award format. Others voiced concern about whether SDA's should be held liable if relocation
occurred despite pre-award assurances to the contrary; several stated that a properly completed pre-award review
should prove due diligence on the part of the SDA and that sanctions otherwise are unduly harsh. The Department believes
that these reviews are for the protection of the State and the SDA/SSG. Section 627.215(d) is revised to provide additional
guidance for States and SDA's in developing standardized pre-award review procedures and to indicate items which
should be included in a review. Information should include the names under which the facility does business, including
successors-in-interest, the name, title, and address of the employer supplying the information; the name and address
of the facility in the other geographic area which is being closed or from which business is being transferred; the
nature of the products or business being transferred to the new location; the date the facility will commence or expand
operations; and a statement from the employer about job losses at the old location. The SDA also should check with the
former location to verify the employer's statements about job loss. The Department believes that a review based upon
the suggestions in the regulations is evidence of due diligence, but does not hold the SDA harmless when it is subsequently
shown that the statute was violated because the Act provides that the Secretary shall require repayment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that assistance to relocating businesses is not an entitlement. Once the State complies with
the minimum requirements set out in these regulations, it may be more restrictive in its assessment of the company's
situation or its determination of policy regarding relocating employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stressed the importance of monitoring to ensure the use of consistent pre-award reviews and also recommended
that the SDA/SSG consult with all affected parties, including union representatives at the original and relocated
site if relocation is indicated and JTPA assistance is sought. Although not required by the regulations, the State
should consider incorporating such procedures in its guidelines for the pre-award review. Before engaging in negotiations
with any company interested in moving to the area which seeks future JTPA assistance, the SDA/SSG should initiate
a pre-award review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a few commenters asked what constituted ``inducement'' or ``encouragement'' to a company to relocate.
The Act provides that ``[N]o funds provided under this Act shall be used or proposed for use to encourage or induce the
relocation, of an establishment or a part thereof, that results in a loss of employment for any employee of such establishment
at the original location.'' Thus, JTPA funds cannot be used in any manner for this purpose. Similarly, JTPA funds cannot
be used under the prohibitions concerning employment generating activities (Section 141(q)). One commenter asked
whether written material containing a general description of JTPA programs could be distributed to the local Chamber
of Commerce. The Department does not believe that providing material to a Chamber of Commerce which provides a general
description of JTPA programs would fall within the prohibition of the Act unless the purpose of the material were to
induce or encourage relocation. This regulation is not intended to affect what the Chamber of Commerce does, as long
as JTPA funds are not used.

Section 627.220 clarifies the interpretation of sections 107(b) and 141(b) of the Act. This section also highlights
the importance of coordination with programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA),
in view of the new coordination provisions at sections 205 and 265 of the Act, which require SDA's to enhance the provision
of services through coordination with other programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of coordination requirements is to preclude duplicate or overlapping payments among Federal, State,
and local programs to participants and training institutions and to ensure that the best mix of programs and funds
is available to the JTPA participant. Accordingly, &sect;627.220 assigns responsibility to the SDA's to coordinate
the sharing of information that affects JTPA-funded programs with the school's financial aid officer, provides
for contractual safeguards to prevent duplication or overlap of services and funding among programs, and emphasizes
the requirement for assessing the JTPA participant's financial needs and available resources as part of the individual
service strategy (ISS). These matters will also be addressed through technical assistance and guidance jointly
developed between DOL and U.S. Department of Education officials in order to guide both systems in the development
of constructive working relationships.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were submitted on a number of issues addressed in this section. The issue of whether JTPA funds should pay
for tuition or supportive services in coordination with other payment programs was raised by some who recommended
that clearer instructions be provided. The exact mix of funds should be determined according to the availability
of each funding source for either training costs or supportive services, with the goal of making the program affordable
and enabling the participant to successfully complete it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters were concerned about the complexity of procedures needed to ensure compliance with sections
107(b) and 141(b) of the Act. The Department agrees with the need to streamline procedures. Accordingly, &sect;627.220
is revised to reflect the following changes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.220(b)(2) is deleted, and &sect;627.220(b)(1) now directs the SDA to assist the participant early in
the objective assessment, as appropriate, to establish eligibility for HEA, title IV financial assistance programs.
In addition, &sect;627.220(b)(4) now emphasizes that participants may, but are not required to, apply for or access
student loans or incur personal debt as a condition of JTPA participation. While the use of student loans to finance
training or education is not prohibited and may be explored in the assessment process, loans should only be used if
the participant agrees and is made fully aware of the responsibilities that the loan entails. Participation in a JTPA
program may not be conditioned on applying for or using a loan. Finally, &sect;627.220(b)(4) clarifies the need for
information sharing which must take place for any financial aid awarded after the participant enrolls in an agreed-upon
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion of HEA student assistance programs in this provision raised a concern that title II participants may
be required to access loans. The Department wishes to stress that this is not the case. Section 627.220(b)(4) emphasizes
the importance of matching the participant with an affordable program. As a general consideration, individuals
should not be required to incur debts as a condition of participating in JTPA programs. Indeed, better identification
and coordination of funding sources and improved evaluation of the participant's ability to complete a program successfully
as part of the ISS should address the need for personal indebtedness to finance JTPA participation. Thus, &sect;627.220(a)
should not be construed to mean that loans must be considered resources for the purposes of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for including HEA, title IV student loans in the information-sharing requirements is that in the past,
some JTPA participants have been required or encouraged to take out loans to pay for their training without the knowledge
of the SDA's. However, the new requirements for objective assessments and developing ISS's for participants mean
that SDA's must take responsibility for evaluating and documenting the participant's financial needs and coordinated
ability to pay for an agreed-upon training program before he/she enrolls in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, several commenters stressed the importance of evaluating all potential HEA funding sources as part of the
development of the ISS and that these funding sources be identified and applied for while the ISS is being developed.
See &sect;627.220(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since federal Pell Grant eligibility can be established before a student enrolls and a Pell Grant can be used at any
participating institution that an eligible student attends, SDA's and SSG's should expedite the application process
by providing application forms to individuals and providing assistance, as necessary, in filling out and submitting
these forms. Although a few commenters were concerned that undue delays in the provision of services might result,
it is important to note that Pell Grant eligibility guidelines are readily available, as is the application form for
establishing eligibility, and the financial information required to complete the application is already required
to ascertain eligibility for JTPA programs. Furthermore, the Department of Education makes funds available to participating
schools before the start of the school year to pay eligible students. These funds can be accessed as soon as eligibility
is documented, the cost of attendance (COA) is calculated, and enrollment occurs. Although a few commenters suggested
that establishing Pell Grant eligibility might represent an administrative burden, the sequence described herein
in fact streamlines the funding decision process for the JTPA delivery system and permits coordination of funding
sources in the context of the ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments questioned a perceived inconsistency between Department of Education and Department of Labor
guidance on whether HEA title IV or JTPA funds must be used first. The Department does not think there is any conflict
with Department of Education regulations with regard to coordinating with JTPA funding decisions for tuition payments
because of the flexibility in the use of the Pell Grant for tuition or other education related expenses. These JTPA
regulations only require that, when a Pell Grant is awarded to a JTPA participant, JTPA funds cannot be expended on
costs that already have been paid by federal Pell Grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned the need for including the participant's agreement to the disposition of the Pell Grant
in the contract with the school, since it is understood that the participant will sign off on the ISS, which includes
information to be shared. Another commenter raised the issue of the Privacy Act as a reason why schools may not share
information regarding JTPA participants with SDA's. To clarify the issue of participant agreement, the final rule
includes the participant's agreement to the information-sharing process in &sect;627.220(c).

Strengthening monitoring provisions was the concern of a few commenters, who stated that requiring the school's
financial aid officer to share financial information on JTPA participants with the SDA is key to following up on the
participant's ISS and to coordinating JTPA funds with other sources of funding. The Department carefully considered
comments which called for reduced coordination requirements but believes that information sharing agreements
are necessary to ensure compliance with this section; however, the separate sharing of students' names may not be
necessary since JTPA agreements with training institutions will include the names of participants for whom payments
to the school are being made. Therefore, this requirement is removed from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters reported that schools are holding JTPA participants personally liable for payments withheld
in accordance with the terms of performance-based contracts. Performance-based contracts (or any other agreements
with service providers) must prohibit schools from holding the student liable for outstanding charges. Otherwise,
the performance-based contract would be undercut because the incentive for the school to perform would be removed.
This practice is prohibited by the U.S. Department of Education as described in the Federal Student Financial Aid
Handbook, Pell Grant Section. Therefore, JTPA program operators should be aware that the use of certain contracting
methods, particularly contracts for classroom-sized projects and fixed unit price, performance-based contracts,
affects how educational institutions are permitted to calculate the COA, which determines the amount of the participant's
Pell Grant. An institution can include a tuition and fee charge for calculating the federal Pell Grant COA only when
contracts or agreements specify the tuition and fees (i.e., individual referrals), when there is a charge recorded
to the student (when JTPA or another source pays the tuition and fee charge and the student would be required to pay these
charges if they were not paid by JTPA or another source). Two types of JTPA agreements do not allow schools to include
tuition and fees in the Pell COA or to make a charge to the student for these costs: (1) Blanket agreements that do not
specify an individual amount to be paid by the SDA for tuition and fees but may include a number of students to be trained
and an amount of compensation to be paid to the school; and (2) performance-based contracts (to the extent they are
still used).

addition, the prohibition of EGA should not be taken to prohibit ordinary employer outreach and job development activities.

Section 141(q) of the Act also includes a prohibition on foreign travel. A number of comments were received requesting
that the prohibition in the interim final regulations on using title I, II, or III funds for foreign travel be narrowed.
While the Department agrees that allowing foreign travel would be beneficial with the implementation of NAFTA, it
was clearly the intent of the Act to restrict the use of funds for economic development and related activities. However,
other foreign travel necessary to the conduct of JTPA program may be allowable; therefore, &sect;627.225(a) is revised
to clarify that the prohibition on foreign travel applies to economic development and related activities prohibited
by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter was concerned that a prohibition on foreign travel would prohibit staff from Territorial or Freely Associated
States recipients, such as American Samoa and Micronesia, from traveling to a State. While the narrower interpretation
of prohibited foreign travel described above should resolve this, the Department wants to clarify that, under section
4(22), such recipients are considered States for JTPA purposes and as such, inter-recipient travel would not be considered
foreign travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification about what cost categories the remaining allowable EGA should be charged.
To clarify, there are no allowable employment generating activities available under JTPA. The allowable activities
discussed in this section are otherwise authorized activities and should be charged to the category of benefit determined
with guidance provided by the Governor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.235 of the interim final rule sets forth some general program requirements for the JTPA program, including
specific reference to the provisions of sections 141, 142, and 143 of the Act, reference to the selective service requirements
of the Act, continuation of the requirement for timely enrollment, and the new requirements of section 124 of the Act
regarding the imposition of State and SDA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested setting forth extensive procedures regarding the appropriate consultation and concurrence
of organized labor. The Department believes that the provisions of the Act, though somewhat revised, are clear and
that in most instances SDA's and others have developed procedures for ensuring that labor is consulted, as appropriate,
in the development of training programs, and that the affected labor organization concurs in writing with training
agreements when there is a collective bargaining agreement, even if it is not impaired. In the years since the inception
of JTPA, this has not systematically emerged as an issue. Accordingly, the final rule is not changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the only aliens who should be eligible for JTPA participation are permanent resident
aliens. The commenter's reasoning is that to serve other aliens in the United States on a temporary basis would waste
scarce JTPA resources. The nondiscrimination provisions of section 167 of the Act set forth the requirements for
the participation of individuals who may not be citizens of the United States, including those who are not permanent
resident aliens. The final rule is not changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that this section be revised to indicate that JTPA is not an entitlement program. The Department
believes that the provisions of sections 204(c)(5), 264(d)(6) of the Act and &sect;628.525 of the interim final rule
adequately address this subject by making it clear that neither eligibility nor participation in a JTPA program creates
an entitlement to services. The final rule is not changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification of when the ``45-day clock'' in paragraph (c) begins for purposes of
enrollment into JTPA, particularly in light of the new program requirements for targeting and assessment. The Department
agrees that such guidance would be helpful and the final rule is changed to indicate that the clock begins with the date
of eligibility determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the requirements of paragraph (e), some commenters questioned the method for determining whether
a requirement which is a rule, regulation, policy, or performance standard is imposed by a State or an SDA. This question
is raised particularly when the Act or these regulations may require the Governor or SDA to develop such a requirement.
In general, any requirement that is issued beyond the actual text of the Act or these regulations should be identified
to the source (State or SDA) that issues it. This guidance applies only to requirements that are not specifically called
for (

SDA as used here includes any entity empowered to act for the SDA including the grant recipient, administrative entity
or the private industry council. See also the discussion of &sect;627.200 above. The final rule is changed to indicate
that it applies to State and SDA requirements that are in addition to those of the Act and regulations.

Section 627.240 of the interim final regulations sets out requirements pertaining to the on-the-job training (OJT)
activity authorized at sections 204(b), 253(a), 314(d) and in title IV of the Act. The interim final regulations dealt
with a few broad areas related to OJT, such as the duration of OJT, OJT payments, contracts for OJT, employer and participant
eligibility, as well as a definition of OJT. Many of the commenters observed that the requirements for OJT have become
so burdensome as to make OJT no longer a viable JTPA training option. The 1992 Amendments made a number of changes in
the requirements for OJT programs which are implemented in these regulations. These changes were aimed at eliminating
perceived abuses in OJT programs. While it is true that these new requirements do limit some flexibility in operating
OJT programs, the Department does not agree that the new requirements in any way make OJT a less desirable or feasible
training option. Indeed, the Department believes that OJT is an important training vehicle for the JTPA program.
As demonstrated by The National JTPA Study (December 1994) , OJT provided ``the most consistent positive program
impacts on the earnings of adults *&blank;*&blank;*. Both women and men in this subgroup enjoyed large positive earnings
gains that were statistically significant and sustained throughout the 30-month follow-up period.'' The Department
believes that entities which deliver OJT will find that these final regulations set forth only those requirements
which are necessary to preserve the integrity of the OJT activity and to ensure that it remains an effective training
tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the definition of OJT in paragraph (a), it is essential to recognize that by using OJT, the JTPA system
is purchasing occupational training needed by a participant_often training not elsewhere available, which is provided
through employment that will usually continue with the employer after the training is completed. (Note the provisions
of paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule regarding placement of OJT participants with other employers). The objective
of OJT is not, as suggested by some commenters, to subsidize wages or to reduce an employer's wage costs, but to purchase
training and to provide an opportunity for JTPA participants that they might not otherwise have. The contents of paragraph
(a) are reorganized into three subordinate paragraphs for better clarity. Language is added in a new paragraph (a)(1)
to clarify the definition of OJT by: (1) Making reference to the ISS as part of the process for determining whether an
individual should be offered OJT, (2) making specific reference to the OJT agreement, and (3) making specific reference
to the principle that the purpose of the OJT arrangement is to purchase training in exchange for reimbursement of the
employer's extraordinary costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By far the most prevalent comment on the interim final rule was that the Department needed to clarify the provisions
relating to the limitations on the duration of OJT which were contained in paragraph (b) of the interim final rule.
The final rule clarifies the durational rules for OJT. The basic rule is that OJT is to be for the length of time normally
needed for training to acquire the skills needed to perform the occupation up to a 6-month length of training. OJT may
not exceed that 6 month maximum training period except in cases in which the training is less than full time and the training
period will exceed 6 calendar months. In that case, OJT may not exceed 500 hours. To more clearly convey these rules,
paragraph (b)(1) is broken into four subordinate paragraphs. Paragraph (b) is also reordered for greater clarity.
Six months of training is defined as the amount of time an employee would work on a regular or full-time basis in the occupation
for which the OJT contract is written in a 6 month period. If the training period is shorter, the training time is still
considered to be the amount of time an employee would work on a regular or full-time basis for that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters observed that OJT contracts were usually written in terms of hours and wondered how this related to the
6-month limitation. The Department wishes to promote local discretion in developing OJT contracts; therefore,
the regulations do not prescribe a particular time category by which SDA's designate the 6-month period, so long as
the designation is consistent with the purpose of the statutory limitation. For example, the 6-month training period
may be expressed in the number of hours (usually not more than 1,040 working hours), days (180 days), or weeks (26 weeks
in 6 months) that an individual would work full-time in a 6-month period. Contracts for OJT which are expressed in any
of these ways will be acceptable. In simplest terms, an OJT employee who enters employment on May 1 and works continuously
on a full-time basis on the OJT occupation would complete 6 months of training on October 31. Whatever time category
the SDA chooses to use to designate the duration of the OJT contract, it should treat any adjustments (such as those
provided for in the discussion below) in the same terms, so if there is an adjustment for illness to a contract written
in working hours, the adjustment will be made in working hours, not weeks or days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the OJT period is interrupted for a full day or more by events beyond the OJT trainee's or the employer's control,
such as holidays, illness, plant downtime, or strike, such time may be added to the original period. Thus, using the
time period of the above example, if an OJT participant is in OJT to learn a machine operation but is ill for 10 working
days (approximately 80 working hours, two working weeks, or one-half of a working month) the OJT period may end approximately
November 11 through November 15 (instead of October 31) depending on how duration is designated in the contract. (The
employer would not be reimbursed for the period in which the participant is not in the OJT occupation.) The objective
of this rule is to assure that the participant receives the full period of training (up to 6 months) in the occupation
for which the OJT contract is written. This rule, of course, applies only to time that a participant was scheduled to
spend in the actual OJT activity. It does not apply to any of the participant's other activities, either in training
or outside of their OJT employment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed the concern that the regulations were too prescriptive in requiring OJT in higher skilled
occupations. The language of &sect;627.240(b)(2) of the interim final rule was merely intended to encourage the
use of OJT in higher skilled occupations. Language is added to the redesignated &sect;627.240(b)(5) to make this
clear. Other commenters were concerned that the 6-month limitation was inconsistent with providing training in
very high skilled occupations. The Department agrees that there are some higher skilled occupations for which OJT
training may not be available because of the 6-month limitation. Nevertheless, that limitation is statutory and
cannot be ignored. The Department believes that there are still a number of higher skilled occupations for which OJT
is appropriate and that it is consistent with both the nature of OJT and with the intent of the Act that States and SDA's
seek to use OJT to provide training in those kinds of occupations. Therefore, the language encouraging OJT in higher
skilled occupations remains in the final regulation. The Department wishes to acknowledge several comments by noting
that, while it encourages OJT in high-skilled occupations, this is not a strict requirement. Also, while OJT contracts
may recognize training times that are longer than 6 months, JTPA reimbursement to the employer is limited to 6 training
months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters wanted to know how the 500 hour exception to the 6-month limitation works. First of all, it should
be repeated that the overall limitation on the duration of OJT is 6 months, not 500 hours. This exception will apply
in only a limited number of situations, such as in the cases of individuals who are disabled, who have limited employment
availability due to child-care or other needs, or who must work a limited or part-time schedule. The final rule makes
it clear that individuals who have not received 500 hours of OJT within 6 months may receive 499 hours of OJT, even if
this results in OJT in excess of the 6-month duration. The 499 hour figure is used because it reflects the ``less than
500 hours'' language contained in the Act. For example, if an individual works for 15 hours a week and 6 months later
has only been in training for about 360 hours (roughly 60 hours a month for 6 months), the participant could be continued
in OJT for up to another 139 hours. The objective is to assure that participants who must work limited or part-time schedules
receive up to 499 hours of OJT, in situations when up to 499 hours of training is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a comment that the interim final rule unnecessarily requires that the regular training duration provided
for in a standard reference be reflected in the participant's ISS, the final rule provides that the training time for
OJT must be reflected in the ISS only when the training time varies from the average training time for the occupation,
using the methodology adopted for computing training time. Thus, when greater or lesser OJT periods than those provided
in standard reference works are necessary, the variation must be reflected in the participant's ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that the language in paragraph (c)(1) of the interim final rule regarding employer payments
is more restrictive than the provisions in the Act. In response to these comments, the final rule is revised to use the
language of the Act, which provides that payments shall not average more than 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer
to such participants. This change provides the SDA with some flexibility in structuring OJT contracts with an individual
employer for multiple participants. Compliance with the statutory requirement is based upon the total allowable
wage base (i.e., regular wages and scheduled increases reflected in the contract) for all JTPA participants. Additionally,
in response to comments which questioned the wage basis for OJT reimbursement, the final rule clarifies in paragraph
(c)(2)(ii), that OJT reimbursement may be based upon regular pay and scheduled increases, and not, as provided in
paragraph (c)(2)(iii), on overtime, shift differential or other premium pay. The Department believes that regular
pay and regular scheduled pay increases reflect the wages specified in the Act and that overtime and shift differential
do not imply a greater level of training cost to the employer. Finally, to clarify a longstanding issue in regard to
OJT, paragraph (c)(2)(iv) indicates that payments are not to be based on time when the participant is not in training
such as on holidays. Such time may also be excluded from the calculation of the duration of OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141(g)(1) of the Act provides that payments to employers ``are deemed to be'' in compensation for the extraordinary
costs associated with training JTPA participants. Section 141(g)(3)(A) of the Act provides that each contract ``specify
the types and duration of on-the-job training and other services to be provided in sufficient detail to allow for a
fair analysis of the reasonableness of proposed costs *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This latter requirement was reflected
in the interim final rule. Some commenters raised a question about the apparent conflict between these provisions,
and the Department wishes to clarify this area. The final rule prohibits the imposition of a requirement on employers
to document extraordinary costs. The Department believes that payments to employers should not produce a recordkeeping
burden on employers by requiring the documentation of extraordinary costs that would unnecessarily make OJT a less
desirable training option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of &sect;627.240(d)(1) of the interim final rule was to reflect the requirements of section 141(g)(3)
of the Act. It was not intended to require specific documentation of an employer's extraordinary costs. The Department
views the final rule as requiring no more recordkeeping of an employer than is already required of the employer for
other purposes, (e.g., an employer would have to maintain payroll records to demonstrate that a participant worked
the number of hours that were billed, but payroll records are already required to be kept for a variety of other federal
and state purposes). Rather, the Department believes that the intent of this requirement is that the contract accurately
reflect the basis for the contract costs, including the number of participants, occupations, wage rates, training
content and the duration of training, provisions for adjustment (such as scheduled wage increases), and the basis
for any other payments (such as separately scheduled classroom training as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this
section).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule is revised to clarify this requirement by removing the confusing language regarding the analysis of
the reasonableness of costs and by reflecting the minimum criteria that will be necessary to make the reasonableness
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) that the OJT agreement provide information
on the training by skill area or task was too prescriptive. These requirements have been removed in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in response to a comment seeking clarification of the meaning of ``types'' of OJT, this language is removed
in the final rule to eliminate confusion. The idea behind this language was simply to capture other kinds of training,
such as classroom training, that will be provided in the course of the OJT training period. The more specific language
in the final rule will capture the same information. Finally, this discussion does not affect the requirements for
broker contracts in which there is to be an adequate reflection of the work performed by the broker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.240(f) of the final rule provides that JTPA participants must be assessed and that OJT must be determined
in the ISS to be a suitable training vehicle. This provision is also applicable if the participant is referred to JTPA
by an employer. If the participant is determined not to be suitable for OJT or for the OJT slot available from the specific
employer, the participant is not eligible for OJT with that employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter sought clarification of &sect;627.240(f)(3) regarding OJT with a participant's previous employer,
particularly in connection with ``upgrading''. This paragraph is intended to address a perceived abuse of the OJT
activity in which the JTPA program provides OJT assistance to an employer to ``train'' a previous employee who had
been laid off or separated when the proposed participant already has the skills required for the job. The training
is in the same occupation for virtually or nearly the same work. In view of the limited availability of JTPA funds and
services, individuals previously employed by or recently hired by the employer prior to referral to JTPA should not
normally be enrolled in JTPA-funded OJT. In order to conduct skill ``upgrading'', which is allowable under section
204(b)(1)(L) of the Act, and retraining, conditions for eligibility and participation must be met and there must
be a demonstrable difference between the job and skill requirements of the upgraded job into which the participant
is being trained and those of the current or prior job. The prohibition against using OJT for ``upgrading'' with the
participant's employer is maintained in the final rule because the Department believes that the JTPA program should
not unnecessarily subsidize an employer's normal workforce training expenses. Paragraph (f)(3) is revised to eliminate
confusion about whether the rule was intended to address the participant's previous employer or the participant's
current employer. The final rule makes it clear that the prohibition applies to both and that it applies only to OJT.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters questioned the specific provisions of &sect;627.240(g)(1) of the interim final regulations which
require that an OJT ``employer who had two or more previous OJT contracts'' and exhibited a pattern of failing to provide
long term employment would be ineligible for other OJT contracts. They pointed out that it is not possible to establish
a ``pattern'' with two cases. In response to these comments, the final rule is revised to reflect Congress' intent
that employers who fail to offer continued employment, unless there is an acceptable reason, should not receive additional
OJT contracts and that the State must issue procedures to implement this requirement. The JTPA program should not
be used to underwrite an employer's labor turnover. The Department points out that the provision in the interim final
rule specified two contracts because, by definition, to have a pattern there must be more than one. The Department
accepts that there may be instances in which a policy may use as few as two contracts, or more than two, to establish a
pattern and will accept reasonable interpretations of what constitutes a pattern. The Department chooses not to
specify what constitutes a pattern and leaves that decision to the State. In the final rule, &sect;627.240(g) is redesignated
&sect;627.240(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters objected to the provisions in the interim final rule that required on-site monitoring of each
OJT contract and on-site monitoring by an OJT brokering contractor before making payments. The Department acknowledges
these concerns and revises these monitoring requirements. The final rule removes the prescriptive requirements
for monitoring each contract and specifies that recipients and subrecipients are required to conduct periodic on-site
monitoring of OJT employers. The requirements pertaining to the areas to be verified through monitoring remain the
same. In addition, the monitoring requirements for brokering OJT contractors remain the same since they are requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to several comments which argued in favor of providing OJT through employment agencies, the final rule
also provides a clarification of the conditions under which employment agencies and employee leasing agencies may
be eligible for OJT agreements. The purpose of OJT is to provide training through an employer, not to subsidize wages
or reduce agency costs. Thus, the final rule indicates that OJT agreements with employment and employee leasing agencies
are to specify the employer that provides the training and the entity to be reimbursed the costs of training. Note that
the word ``temporary'' is deleted from the rule since the term ``employment agency'' includes agencies that may arrange
employment on less than a full-time basis.

Work Experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of &sect;627.245 of the interim final rule set forth requirements pertaining to work experience.
The work experience activity is related to other activities in which there is work-based training, such as entry employment
experience and limited internships, but the activities may differ due to the circumstances of the work experience
assignment. Such circumstances could include whether the participant is an adult or a youth, whether the host employer
is public, private non-profit, or private for-profit, whether an employer-employee relationship is established,
and whether there is an expectation of continued employment, or whether the activity is a short-term training opportunity.
For example, entry employment experience and limited internship in the private sector are not allowable activities
for adults. ``Work experience'' is available only in the public or private non-profit sector. The Department acknowledges
the relationship among these activities but chooses not to provide specific definitions beyond that for work experience
so as not to arbitrarily limit development of types of work-based training activities. The Department wishes to encourage
a variety of approaches to these activities. For that reason, &sect;627.245(a) is revised by deleting the reference
to limited internships and entry employment experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of work experience clarifies that work experience is primarily a training, not an employment, assignment.
The words ``employing agency'' are removed from the interim final rule to address the concern that work experience
automatically establishes an employment relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted that the provisions of paragraph (b) of the interim final rule that dealt with the types of individuals
for which work experience would be ``suitable'' did not adequately reflect the circumstances under which it would
be appropriate to use work experience. The final rule is revised to delete this characterization of the individuals
for whom work experience is appropriate. The paragraph now only states how work experience is to be designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments criticizing the limitations on the duration of work experience, entry employment experience,
and limited internships, the Department has decided to remove the limitations. The Department believes that this
change will permit the development of activities that may better meet the individual needs of participants and the
final rule indicates that this should be reflected in the ISS. The Department expects that discrete periods of work
experience participation will be limited in duration; although, in response to comments and in recognition of successful
program models, the Department acknowledges that an individual may benefit from participation in multiple work
experience opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters asked for removal or revision of the provision that work experience is suitable for individuals who
have been ``out of the labor force for an extended period of time *&blank;*&blank;*.'' They pointed out that this is
difficult to interpret, may vary depending on the previous experience and other characteristics of the participant,
and is the kind of provision that could unnecessarily lead to varying interpretations and audit exceptions. The final
regulations provide only that work experience should promote the development of good work habits and basic work skills.
In addition, it is the Department's belief that the work experience activity provides an excellent opportunity to
provide non-traditional employment opportunities, in a variety of settings, for women and youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the prohibition of work experience in title III be removed or revised. Since title
III dislocated workers generally have, by definition, previous employment under which work habits and basic work
skills are developed, the provision in the interim final rule is not revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a few commenters asked for clarification of the requirement that work experience be combined with basic
or occupational skills training_particularly in light of one of the examples provided in &sect;628.535. This is
addressed in the discussion of &sect;628.535, but by way of general guidance, the prohibition may not be addressed
by combining work experience with any of the other proscribed stand-alone activities such as job search or job club.

Subpart C_Payments, Supportive Services, Benefits, and Working Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were received on Subpart C of the interim final rule, Payments, Benefits and Working Conditions.
The Department has rethought its positions in response to these comments and the final rule contains a considerable
number of changes. Subpart C is revised, retitled, and renumbered. The following discussion is intended to clarify
the Department's position on payments and supportive services and identifies the changes from the interim final
to the final regulations. In keeping with the Amendments' emphasis on targeting services to the hardest-to-serve
and the need for longer-term interventions, these regulations clarify the widened array of payments, supportive
services, benefits and working conditions available or required under the Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments provide for comprehensive supportive services and for their allocation to the training-related
and supportive service cost category. The regulations implement these provisions and also provide for clarification
of the various types of payments for title II programs. Some payments can be allocated to the training-related and
supportive services cost category while others can be allocated to the training cost category. The treatment of specific
expenditures is provided for at &sect;627.440 of these regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters expressed confusion regarding appropriate documentation procedures and requested clarification
on the requirements and the mechanisms for providing payments and supportive services to participants. Several
commenters suggested that while the legislation clearly intended to increase supportive services and payments,
the requirements in the interim final regulations would probably limit their usage. In response, the final rule is
revised to minimize the amount of documentation necessary to establish an individual's need for supportive services
and payments while maintaining the necessary safeguards to prevent misuse of program funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule is revised to permit a simplified service strategy. For example, under title II, it is intended that
a participant, based upon the needs identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS, will be provided
or the program will arrange for the necessary payments and supportive services to enable the participant to meet the
goals set out in the ISS. The necessary payments and supportive services may be provided or paid for in different ways.
For example, participants may receive a payment from a training activity, such as an employer-paid wage for OJT, or
work-based training payment for work experience which may be counted toward meeting their needs in addition to other
supportive services like child care. Participants may also receive supportive services, such as financial assistance
under title II that will provide for the participant's general welfare. If the participant has additional specific
needs not met by the supportive services, including a need for financial assistance, title II further provides for
an individually determined needs-based payment may be made to the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulation provides for significantly different documentation requirements than did the interim final
rule. An individual determination of need, over and above what normally occurs in the objective assessment and ISS,
is not required to justify the provision of any supportive service. When a participant is given money rather than a
voucher for a supportive service, SDA's and SSG's need not ensure that the payment is exactly equal to the participant's
expenditure. The policy of the SDA or SSG may allow for a fixed reimbursement or a schedule of different reimbursement
amounts for a type of service, however, the policy must provide the rationale for such amounts. Under title II, if the
objective assessment and the ISS indicate that a needs-based payment is also necessary, then that determination
will be sufficient to make the payment. A payment may then be made in accordance with a locally developed policy and
recorded in the ISS along with the other services provided. Changes to reflect this strategy are made throughout &sect;&sect;627.305
and 627.310 of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shifting to more specific recommendations, in response to comments that the supportive services section be separated
from the benefits and working conditions section, the supportive services regulations are now found under &sect;627.310,
while benefits and working conditions are now addressed under a new &sect;627.315. Section 627.300 and the title
of subpart C are also amended to clarify these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was received regarding the ability to ensure that services were provided equitably. This concern is heightened
with the reduction in documentation required when providing supportive services and payments. Therefore, a new
provision is added at &sect;&sect;627.305(a)(3) and 627.310(d) requiring that SDA's ensure, to the extent possible,
that similarly situated participants receive similar payments or supportive services, as appropriate.

Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested clarification on when payments shall count towards the determination of income for other
programs that serve JTPA participants. To clarify, language from section 142(b) of the Act is now included in &sect;627.305(a)(4).
Any payment under JTPA, broadly defined for this section as any JTPA funds received by a participant except OJT wages
(since OJT wages are paid by an employer), shall not be counted for purposes of determining income for other Federal
or federally assisted programs, except as provided under the Social Security Act. For example, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development has issued a policy notice (PIH 92&hyph;48, October 16, 1992) which states, ``[A]ll
payments received under programs funded in whole or part under the Job Training Partnership Act are excluded from
Annual Income'' for purposes of Public and Indian Housing. The major exception to disregarding JTPA income is under
title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act which governs Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The AFDC
regulations do allow States flexibility in allowing a dependent child's JTPA income to be disregarded as income for
AFDC purposes (45 CFR 233.20(a)(11)), but generally, any JTPA payment to an adult AFDC recipient, except to cover
the cost of child care, transportation, work-related expenses or work-related services, is counted as earned income.
States are encouraged to work with their welfare departments in developing State policies specifically for JTPA.
SDA's also are encouraged to coordinate with their local AFDC agency to determine local policies on income disregards
and to consider co-enrollment with JOBS, where appropriate, so that the participant may be aware of all available
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.305(a) is revised to include a new paragraph (a)(6) which authorizes SDA's to set fixed levels for payments.
Section 627.305(b) is amended by replacing the words ``formula or procedure'' with the word ``policy''. These changes
permit SDA's to make needs-related payments based on a payment schedule without any other documentation than that
used to develop or support the schedule. Only in cases in which a participant's needs exceed the payments available
under the payment schedule is any other documentation or justification necessary. The change in the wording of &sect;627.305(b)
also is intended to make it clear that there are no extraordinary documentation requirements to support the SDA's
system for payments above its payment schedule. All that is needed is a reasonable policy based on the circumstances
of the local community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Needs-based payments. Needs-based payments may be made in circumstances where fixed or scheduled supportive services
fail to meet the needs of an individual to participate. For example, if a standard transportation reimbursement is
$2 a day for participants, but a particular participant must spend $10 a day to commute to a training program, this need
would be identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS. Then a needs-based payment of $8 could be made
to meet that participant's transportation needs. No additional documentation other than the transportation need
identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS is required for the initial $2. However, a specific
notation of the additional need would be identified in the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS for the $8 needs-based
payment. While this payment should be the amount ``necessary for participation,'' it also may be a scheduled or fixed
amount (see the discussion of supportive services, below, for an additional discussion on ``scheduled'' or ``fixed
amount''), as provided for in the SDA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incentive and bonus payments. A number of comments were received requesting that the ability to use incentive and
bonus payments not be limited to title II&hyph;C. Several commenters indicated they would prefer to use incentive
and bonus payments rather than a wage or training payment to encourage participant performance. Since it is important
to have tools to reward participant accomplishment, and incentive and bonus payments are not prohibited in those
titles, the final rule is amended to clarify that incentive and bonus payments also may be made to participants under
titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately equal numbers of comments were received requesting that &sect;627.305(c) require that incentive
and bonus payments be based upon attendance and performance as there were comments requesting attendance or performance.
Several commenters thought that teaching life skills, such as good attendance, is an appropriate function of JTPA
and should be rewardable. Because section 264(c)(2)(D) of the Act uses the word ``and'', the final regulation is revised
to reflect the statutory language. Payments are to be reasonable and commensurate with the behavior being rewarded.
The policy for such a payment is to be included in the SDA job training plan, which is approved by the Governor. The provisions
of paragraph (c) are amended in the final rule by removing paragraphs (c) (2) through (4), to reflect the simplification
of this topic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training payments. To permit longer term participation, &sect;627.305(d) provides for training payments to be
paid for certain title II activities, such as work experience and limited internships. Section 627.305(e) provides
for training payments for participation in other activities, such as classroom training, if the concurrent work-related
activity is for more than 50 percent of the training time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters indicated that the work-based training requirement for adults in classroom training combined
with work experience at interim final &sect;627.305(e)(2) may not always be appropriate and was redundant with regard
to the requirements of section 204(c)(1) of the Act on workplace context and integration. Therefore, the Department
encourages SDA's to link classroom training to the work-based training activity, but the condition for making such
payments to adults that the classroom training have a workplace context is removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``wage'' is replaced with ``training payment'' or ``training payment for combined activity'' to reflect
the rare circumstances when a participant may not be in an employee-employer relationship as defined by the Internal
Revenue Service, and also to make clear that the SDA may not be required to make a payment equal to the minimum wage. The
minimum wage requirement still exists where participants are receiving wages as outlined in section 142 of the Act.
The Department believes that payments in most work-based training activities should be equal to or exceed the minimum
wage to better approximate a work setting. With the exclusion of on-the-job training and disaster relief employment,
this change from ``wage'' to ``payment'' runs through the entire payments section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive Services. Supportive services are often critical in serving those most in need. The use of supportive
services is encouraged to enable the hard-to-serve population to participate in longer term interventions. The
objective assessment and, under title II, the ISS, is the basis for determination of need for a particular supportive
service. The major change in &sect;627.310 is that further documentation of need is not required. Supportive services
may be provided in-kind, through cash assistance, or by arrangement with another human service agency when necessary
to enable an individual eligible for JTPA training, but who cannot afford to pay for such services, to participate
in JTPA-assisted programs. Several commenters indicated that the administrative determination and documentation
of participants' actual cost, for example, of lunch or transportation, was unduly burdensome. Given the generally
narrow variance in cost for those services, most stated that a single dollar amount, or a schedule of dollar amounts,
would be equally prudent. The Department agrees that such a method is acceptable and should be outlined in the supportive
services policy of the SDA or SSG. To reduce its administrative burden, an SDA or SSG may set fixed levels of benefit
for particular supportive services; e.g., an SDA or SSG may reimburse participants who incurred transportation
expenses with identical payments, regardless of actual cost to an individual participant, even though some participants
may receive a payment above their actual cost and others may be underpaid.

Section 627.310(a) sets forth the parameters for the provision of supportive services. The preamble to the interim
final rule noted that ``limited supportive services'' were permitted for applicants. A few commenters requested
that this be stated in the regulations. This provision can now be found at &sect;627.310(b). A comment was also received
requesting that the ``limited'' in limited supportive services be defined. The Department declines to define ``limited'';
rather, the final rule is revised to indicate that such payments may be made to provide the applicant with an opportunity
to complete the application process. The Department expects the restriction on the training-related supportive
services cost category to act as a natural control on SDA's and SSG's while still permitting flexibility for local
level decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.310(g)(1) provides that supportive services may include financial assistance under title II. In order
to ensure a comprehensive system of supportive services and payments, there have been changes to the definition and
allowable usage of financial assistance. Financial assistance is intended for the purpose of general support typical
of stipends and allowances. A number of commenters indicated that requiring additional documentation in order to
receive any type of financial support was redundant, particularly with JTPA's hard-to-serve population. The Department
agrees that participants pass through significant income eligibility tests upon entering the program and that additional
eligibility checks are unnecessary, inefficient, and discourage the provision of necessary services. Therefore,
the final regulations state, at &sect;627.310(g)(2), that financial assistance may be deemed to be necessary for
eligible participants and, as a supportive service, may be a fixed payment or based upon a schedule of payments. The
SDA shall include financial assistance in its policy on supportive services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.305(g) of the interim final rule dealing with needs-related payments is redesignated &sect;627.310(h)
to reflect the similarity of needs-related payments under title III with financial assistance under title II. However,
needs-related payments are the only form of general ``cash'' assistance (excluding cash provided as a reimbursement
for transportation expenses, etc.) allowable under title III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters disagreed with the statement in the preamble to the interim final rule that supportive services could
not be based on a group characteristic, such as welfare. In light of the other changes made in the final rule, this statement
is no longer applicable. In developing the policy called for in the final rule, an SDA may use a group characteristic
as a basis for determining supportive service needs. For example, under title II, a financial assistance payment
to a participant may be fixed, based upon an income schedule or group characteristic (such as welfare recipient) identified
in the objective assessment and reported in the ISS, or may be determined in accordance with another method determined
by the SDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations reflect the Department's intent that financial assistance be treated as a supportive service for
the general welfare of the participant. This assistance is to be based upon the financial needs of an eligible individual
to permit the individual to participate in training. With this basic premise, the Department intends that financial
assistance payments, in addition to not being considered as income in accordance with section 142(b) of the Act, should
not be subject to income and employment taxes. However, all such decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Benefits and Working Conditions. The provision of &sect;627.310(b)&hyph;(d) of the interim final rule are redesignated
and revised as a new &sect;627.315. One commenter suggested that the regulations should not require participants
to work for employers that are violating labor laws. In response, &sect;627.315(a) is amended to reflect this concern
for compliance with applicable labor laws.

Reallotment and Reallocation. Section 627.410 implements the new section 109 of the Act, which requires the Governor
to reallocate, among SDA's in the State, unobligated funds in excess of 15 percent of any SDA's program year title II
allocation.

A number of commenters responded on the provisions of this section. Almost all of them recommended basing reallocations
on obligations rather than expenditures and questioned whether a State could adopt a more restrictive reallocation
policy based on expenditures. Most of the other comments were requests that the regulations further clarify the reallotment
and reallocation provisions of the Act including an interpretation of section 109(a)(3) of the Act concerning SDA's
that have the highest rates of unemployment for an extended period of time and the highest poverty rates. One commenter
pointed out a potential conflict between the provisions of section 109 of the Act, which bases reallocation on obligations,
and section 161(b)(1) of the Act, which ties reallocation to expenditures. Another commenter raised the issue of
whether Title II&hyph;B (summer) funds could be reallocated.

Given the legislative history of the statutory provision, particularly the 1991 House Committee Report (H.R. Rep.
No. 102&hyph;240, 63 and 64 (1991)), the Department believes that the intent of Congress was to ensure effective,
timely use of the funds. The Department previously suggested that another interpretation, based upon the provisions
of section 161(b) of the Act, might permit a more rigorous standard, such as expenditure. However, upon further review,
the Department believes that the language in the statute is clear in providing that the basis for reallocation is to
be the ``obligation'' of funds and the Department now believes that an interpretation that is more restrictive would
be inconsistent with the Act. A new paragraph (a)(2) is added that prohibits the Governor from imposing reallocation
requirements that are based on other than obligations. While it may be true, as some commenters suggested, that basing
reallocation solely on obligations may lead to last minute obligations of funds which have little program purpose
simply to avoid reallocation, the Department is constrained by the statutory language and cannot use that possibility
as a basis for varying from a clear statutory requirement.

In regard to further interpretation of section 109(a)(3) of the Act concerning SDA's that have the highest rates of

criterion and is leaving the interpretation of this section to each Governor, as provided in the Conference Committee

A few commenters responded to the provisions of &sect;627.415. A few other commenters on &sect;627.435, Allowable
costs and cost principles, suggested that &sect;627.435 should include provisions for allowing the costs of contributions
to reserves for self-insurance to be specifically allowed in that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments, paragraph (c) of &sect;627.415 of the interim final rule is removed and the substance
of the second sentence concerning contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program is moved to &sect;627.435(h).
The first sentence of this paragraph (c) basically repeated the provisions of &sect;627.315(b), Benefits and working
conditions, and is, therefore, unnecessary in this provision.

A few commenters were concerned about the scope of insurance coverage required by the rule. Some asked whether the
rule required them to provide insurance coverage for work-related activities or for all training. One thought that
the regulation required ``no fault'' coverage that could be satisfied through an ordinary comprehensive liability
policy. Section 627.415 does not address the scope of insurance coverage. Section 627.315(b) requires worker's
compensation or similar insurance coverage for work-related training activities. States and SDA's/SSG's should
provide such coverage as they deem prudent and as are in accordance with their normal insurance procedures, both in
terms of the types of risks covered and the method of coverage (self-insurance or purchase of insurance policies).

Some commenters thought that the procurement portion of the interim final regulations is an example of overregulation,
while others believed that the regulations did not go far enough. In response to the comments concerning overregulation,
the Department notes that section 164(a)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to take into consideration the OMB circulars
and that these regulations actually represent a pared-down version of the OMB Circulars. As such, they represent
less federal regulation than is applied to other Federal grant programs. In response to the comments concerning underregulation,
the Department does not agree. The requirements that are established should help maximize competition, ensure fiscal
accountability, and prevent fraud and abuse in JTPA programs. The Department believes that the final regulation
represents a reasonable balance between providing guidance on the issues on which the Secretary is required to set
minimum requirements under section 164(a)(3) of the Act and recognizing the prerogatives of the Governors to develop
their own procurement rules, which also is recognized in that provision.

Although at the Federal level there are rules for when to use contracts, grants and cooperative agreements, these
rules are not applicable to the JTPA. As a result, what one State calls a contract, another State might call a grant.
In order to avoid confusion in these regulations, the following terms are being used: ``Award'' or ``agreement''
means a contract, grant, subcontract, subgrant or other type of legal instrument; ``awardee'' means any one of the
entities receiving the award (e.g., contractors, grantees). There was concern expressed over whether buying certain
supplies, like floppy disks, at office supply stores and other similar businesses constitutes an award. Through
these regulations, an upper limit for small purchases (which can be lowered, but not raised, by the Governor's procurement
standards) is established. No further breakdowns are delineated in the regulations. The Governor can, through the
State procurement standards, establish other thresholds for the purchasing of consumable materials with credit
cards and such, and not require a formalized award process (e.g., competition or cost/price analysis) or document.
As an example, the current Federal ceiling is $2,500 per consumable item.

Section 627.420(a) reiterates the requirement established through the Amendments that the Governor establish
procurement standards to ensure fiscal accountability and prevent fraud and abuse in JTPA programs. This section
further requires the State and local levels to follow procurement policies and procedures used for non-Federal funds,
with some caveats, and reiterates the non-duplication requirement contained in section 107(b) of the Act. A small
number of commenters were concerned that the requirement that the State and local levels follow their own procurement
policies and procedures used for non-Federal funds would result in awards always being made to the lowest bidder without
other considerations, such as performance. State and local rules are to be followed as long as they comply with the
minimum requirements of the procurement section. One of the requirements for the selection of vendors and subrecipients
(discussed below) is that the awarding agency make a determination of demonstrated performance prior to award. If,
as a result of this determination, it is apparent that the lowest bidder cannot perform the work at an acceptable level
of quality, SDA's should not make an award to that bidder.

A few commenters were concerned that the nonduplication requirement of &sect;627.420(a)(5) would make it difficult
for SDA's to select service providers. This requirement reflects the provisions of section 107(b) of the Act and is
necessary to maximize the use of JTPA funds. One of the initial steps in any JTPA procurement should be a determination
concerning whether or not procuring such services (whether competitively or through sole source) would be a duplication.
The determination of non-duplication need not be exhaustive; it may take into account such things as the cost of the
existing services, waiting lists, the effectiveness of the services to be provided, and the likelihood of achieving
performance goals. Although there may be entities in the geographic area which provide the required services, these
entities may not provide the necessary customized training or may not be able to provide these services in a timely
manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters felt that the vendor/subrecipient distinction (see the definitions sections of the preamble and
the regulations) found in other parts of the regulations was not clear in this section. This section is intended to
apply to all awards and, for the purposes of this section, the same rules apply to the procurement of awards to both vendors
and subrecipients. Thus, the vendor/subrecipient distinction is not treated in this section as it is in other provisions
of the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 107(e) of the Act requires that selection of service providers include documentation of compliance with
procurement standards established by the Governor. Section 627.420(a) is expanded by adding a definition of procurement
to mean the process which leads to any award of JTPA funds. Some commenters wondered if the requirements for a determination
of demonstrated performance, contained in &sect;627.422, Selection of Service Providers, applied to vendors.
Based on the definition of service providers, this requirement does apply to vendors. On its surface it may appear
that the requirement for a determination of demonstrated performance goes against the requirements for full and
open competition. Since the overall goal of JTPA is to provide high quality services to eligible participants, the
requirement of the determination of demonstrated performance leads to the meeting of this goal by requiring the selection
of entities that can do the work effectively. This requirement further supports the fiscal accountability and prevention
of fraud requirements of the Act, since demonstrated performance includes such things as a satisfactory record of
integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(b) further delineates the Act's requirement of full and open competition. A few commenters asked
for definitions of certain terms, such as ``arbitrary action'' and ``overly restrictive specification.'' Since
each procurement action and system must be looked at on a case-by-case basis, the Department thinks that it would be
inappropriate to define these terms. If further definition is required at the State level, the Governor may do so in
the guidelines that he/she establishes. A few commenters were concerned that stricter State procurement codes could
take precedence over Federal regulations. These commenters are correct; the Governor has the discretion to make
the procurement rules more strict. However, the Governor does not have the authority, unless indicated in the law
or regulations, to make a legislative and/or regulatory requirement less strict. One commenter felt that paragraph
(b)(2)(i) should require an identification of quantities to be purchased. This change is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(c) establishes conflict of interest requirements. Although there is a separate subsection that
addresses PIC conflict of interest, PIC's were also included in the subsections that address recipient and subrecipient
conflict of interest. A few commenters correctly pointed out that by inclusion in the latter, it would make it impossible
for companies for which PIC members work to be awarded JTPA funds. This section is amended to remove the reference to
PIC members in paragraph (c)(2) and is reorganized to increase clarity. Paragraph (c)(4), which deals with PIC conflict
of interest is redesignated as paragraph (c)(3) but remains unchanged. Because of the separate treatment of PIC's
and recipients/subrecipients, the portions of paragraph (c)(2), which provide information on when a conflict of
interest would arise for either PIC's or recipients/subrecipients, are moved into a separate paragraph (c)(4).
It should be noted that the phrase ``is about to employ'' in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) also applies to cases of negotiation
for employment. The language is not changed in order to maintain consistency with the OMB Circulars. The original
paragraph (c)(5) is combined with paragraph (c)(1), since both deal with standards of conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters submitted comments on &sect;627.420(d). This section is based on OMB Circular A&hyph;102, and
describes the four procurement methods that are available to JTPA entities. Language is added to &sect;627.420(d)(1)(i),
prohibiting awards from being broken down into several purchases merely to be able to use small purchase procedures.
The Department does not intend that small purchase procedures be used improperly to avoid the more formal competitive
processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of these comments concerned paragraph (d)(4) of the interim final rule (redesignated in the final rule
as (d)(1)(iv)), which provides a listing of the circumstances under which recipients and subrecipients may use the
sole-source method of procurement. One of the circumstances calls for awarding agency approval of noncompetitive
proposals. The final regulations are changed to state that for SDA's, SSG's and subrecipients, the awarding agency
provides authorization; for States, the noncompetitive proposal is approved through the State's normal sole source
approval process. Without this change, States would have had to submit their proposed sole source awards that do not
meet one of the circumstances to the Department of Labor, the awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments require that all sole source awards be justified and documented in writing. When a State or other subrecipient
identifies specific entities that may be sole-source awardees (e.g., the Employment Service for assessment services)
by their subrecipients, the State or other subrecipient that identifies the specific entity is responsible for the
justification and documentation that serves as the basis for that specific sole source selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to both the OJT and classroom training (CRT) sole source exceptions, there was some confusion concerning
the requirement that not only does the procurement have to meet one of the criteria, but also has to be infeasible under
small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals. Clearly, OJT and individual CRT placements are
unique in the procurement world. Neither is usually procured through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process.
Although both should be procurable under small purchase procedures, some State rules may not allow this. As a result,
the regulations are revised to allow the sole source procurement of OJT (except awards to brokering contractors)
and individual CRT without having to demonstrate that the three other methods of procurement are infeasible. This
provision of the regulation may be used in the written justification for such sole source authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the sole source exception for procurement of ``Enrollment of individual participants in classroom training,''
some commenters expressed a concern that this would be used to justify sole source awards for the referral of a number
of individuals to the same classroom training. This exception may be used to justify a sole source award to place an
individual participant in classroom training. If a recipient or subrecipient, over the course of a year, makes sufficient
individual referrals to the point that the small purchase maximum is exceeded (either the level established through
these regulations or the State established level, whichever is lower), they will be expected to compete the requirement
the following year. If it is necessary to procure a class for JTPA participants only, it is not appropriate to use this
sole source exception. It may, though, be appropriate to use small purchase procedures or to justify the sole source
procurement of the class through other exceptions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters thought that setting up Labor Management Committees should be listed as one of the allowable sole
source criteria. The expenses incurred in the formation of these committees promoted by the State's Dislocated Worker
Units would be a rapid response expense (section 314(b)(1)(B)), subject to the financial management and procurement
procedures of the States. In most cases, it is expected that the costs of setting up a Labor Management Committee would
not be great and that small purchase procedures may apply. Therefore, the regulations are not changed. If a committee
were to apply to be a service provider, procurement rules would apply. If a committee, as a service provider, were to
use JTPA monies to procure services for participants, procurement rules also apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(d) is reorganized by redesignating the subordinate paragraphs and including a new paragraph (d)(2),
which authorizes units of State or local government or SDA and SSG administrative entities to pass through monies
to like organizations, e.g., a public housing authority, and not have the procurement requirements apply. When monies
are passed through, the receiving organization must either pass the monies through to a similar organization, or
procure services in accordance with the procurement rules. The passing through of funds is a method of transferring
monies to the actual entity doing the procuring which is practiced at the Federal, State, and local levels. The new
language reflects this acceptable practice. The Department cautions that organizations which may receive pass
throughs may also receive funds as service providers, in which case procurement rules will apply to awards to these
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters submitted comments on &sect;627.420(e). Section 164(a)(3)(C) of the Act established the
requirement that ``procurements shall include an appropriate analysis of the reasonableness of costs and prices.''
Several of the commenters disagreed with the use of the phrase ``cost or price analysis'' (as compared to ``cost and
price analysis''). The Department interprets the requirement of ``an appropriate analysis'' to mean that recipients
and subrecipients are required to do whatever analysis (price or both cost/price) is appropriate to their situation.
This is supported by OMB Circular A&hyph;102, which requires a price analysis alone under very limited circumstances,
and requires a price analysis whenever a cost analysis is undertaken. Additionally, the commercial reality is that
in many cases you either cannot do both a cost and price analysis (when there are no market prices or historical contract
prices available) or it would be superfluous to do both (when what is being bought is available at catalogue prices).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern was also expressed over the requirement that recipients and subrecipients perform a cost or price analysis
in connection with every procurement, including modifications. Some commenters believed that the paragraph (e)(1)
requirement for a cost or price analysis for all modifications should be changed to exclude non-monetary modifications.
After consideration of this concern, paragraph (e)(2) is amended to reflect this exclusion. Care should be taken,
though, in determining which modifications do not have monetary implications. For example, a modification to reduce
the number of participants may, on its face, appear to be non-monetary. This is not the case. A modification to reduce
the number of participants, without a corresponding reduction in funding, results in an increase in the cost per participant.
Therefore, this type of modification is one which has monetary impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(e)(2) describes cost or price analysis requirements. This paragraph is revised in order to make
it easier to read, but the requirements are not changed. This paragraph requires recipients and subrecipients to
make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. This requirement, which also comes from OMB Circular
A&hyph;102, appears to have caused confusion. A number of commenters felt that SDA's would not be able to develop such
estimates, due to the fact that they do not know which specific activities will be offered by a service provider until
offers are received in response to RFP's. In those cases where it is not known what specific services will be provided,
it will be appropriate for recipients and subrecipients to develop ``rough yardsticks,'' such as cost per placement
or cost per enrollee, for specific types of training. These independent estimates are used, in part, as a tool to determine
whether or not the proposals are correctly responding to the technical requirements of the RFP. The estimates are
also used to determine the reasonableness of costs/prices which are offered. An offer which is priced too low may be
indicative of, among other things, an offeror who does not understand the requirements of the RFP. An offer which is
priced too high may contain more expensive interventions than are required. Only through the comparison of the costs
and prices contained in each offer with the estimate can these potential problems be identified. It should be stressed,
however, that the independent estimates are not absolute barriers to accepting higher or lower cost proposals; the
estimates are merely meant for internal guidance. An awarding agency may select for award a proposal that is more or
less costly than the estimates, if it determines that the costs and price(s) are reasonable and that the services offered
meet program requirements. The level of detail that recipients and subrecipients need in developing these estimates
may be specified by the Governor in the State standards. Several commenters indicated that awarding agencies should
include the independent estimates in the RFP. Under no circumstances is this to be done. Since the purpose of developing
the estimates is for internal control, publicizing them would defeat the purpose for which they are developed and
might also skew the bidding.

One of the &sect;627.420(e)(2) requirements for cost analysis comes into play when the offeror is required to submit
the elements of the estimated cost. This is clarified by indicating that this requirement applies in the case of subrecipient
relationships. Subrecipients are required to allocate costs to the various JTPA cost categories; therefore, they
are to submit the separate elements of their costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(e)(3) reiterates the requirement of section 164(a)(3)(D) of the Act that ``procurements shall
not provide excess program income *&blank;*&blank;* or excess profit.'' The Act lists some of the factors that shall
be taken into consideration in determining whether program income or profit is excessive. Through the regulations,
additional factors from OMB Circular A&hyph;102 have been added. Further, based on this Circular, the instances
when profit or program income is negotiated are defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters on this section, as well as &sect;627.440, Classification of Costs, raised questions concerning
fixed unit price, performance-based contracts (FUPC's), including whether FUPC's could continue to be used and,
if so, whether costs could be allocated to the JTPA cost categories based on budgeted amounts or whether they must be
charged based on actual costs incurred. Concern also was expressed both over the requirement that offerors certify
their costs and the prohibition of excess program income or profit, in relation to fixed-price agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department continues to believe that the use of performance based awards may be of significant benefit in serving
JTPA customers. In addition, the use of a total fixed price or ceiling price in making awards may also be an effective
mechanism. The regulation does not prohibit reasonable profits in the context of a fixed-price agreement. Fixed-price
agreements are instruments that place more risk on the awardee than do cost reimbursement agreements. The reason
for this is that the awardee, under a fixed-price agreement must perform the work, regardless of the costs to the awardee.
In the case of an awardee under a cost reimbursement type of agreement, the awarding agency will reimburse the awardee
for its allowable costs. If the awardee under a fixed-price agreement is able to do the work at a lower cost, due to efficiencies
in operations, and this increases the level of profit, the awardee is due that additional profit. If successful awardees
who have increased profit due to efficient performance are required to reduce their earned profits to the budgeted
levels, this would result in a disincentive for organizations to perform their work more efficiently, quickly, etc.
If the additional profit results from cost data that was not accurate, complete or current, as certified, then the
awarding agency may be able to recoup that excess from the awardee. Thus, the requirement that costs be certified provides
a needed protection to awarding agencies. There has been skepticism that fixed price contracts, as utilized in JTPA,
did not contain risks for the awardee or operate as performance/outcome based agreements. The system can expect continued
high levels of scrutiny by the OIG in the case of fixed price agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of awards to subrecipients, when: (1) The awarding agency has done a cost and price analysis; (2) this analysis
has been documented; (3) the conclusions arrived at are reasonable; and (4) the offeror has certified in writing that
to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost and pricing data submitted are accurate, complete and current at the
time of agreement on price, the awarding agency may find it appropriate to use a fixed-price type of agreement. The
costs of such an agreement may be allocated among the benefitting cost categories based upon the ratios established
in the cost analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter did not believe that it was the Department's intent to require SDA's/SSG's to track profit earned by
commercial organizations. In point of fact, section 165(g)(1) of the Act requires each State, SDA, and SSG to maintain
records with respect to subrecipients, including commercial organizations, that identify any program income or
profit earned.

Section 627.420(e)(4) is amended to correct a miscitation from &sect;627.435(e) to &sect;627.435(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(e)(5) prohibits the use of the cost-plus percentage of cost method. This prohibition comes from
both OMB Circular A&hyph;102 and the FAR. A few commenters indicated that this was an advantageous procurement method.
This Federal-wide prohibition is being maintained in the final regulations due to the fact that these types of agreements
provide a disincentive to vendors/subrecipients to reduce costs, since the higher the overall cost of the agreement,
the higher the profit. It is recommended that JTPA entities negotiate specific dollar levels of profit, or investigate
the possible use of other types of agreements, such as cost-plus award fee. Further, there appears to be some misunderstanding
concerning the allowability of using fixed-price agreements. Fixed-price agreements are the preferred type of
agreement when using the sealed bid (Invitation for Bids) process. Fixed-price agreements may be performance-based
and may be chargeable to a benefiting cost category based upon a documented cost analysis, as discussed above, the
services provided, and whether the agreement is for tuition or for a commercially available training package, as
discussed in connection with &sect;627.440. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(g) which reiterates the requirement found in section 164(a)(3)(I) of the Act that procurement transactions
between units of State or local government or entities organized principally as the administrative entity for SDA's
or SSG's, shall be on a cost-reimbursable basis. The final rule now clarifies that cost-plus types of agreements are
not allowable (e.g., cost-plus fixed-fee). Based on one comment, language is added concerning the payment of tuition
and/or entrance fees to schools that are part of a governmental entity. The specific instances under which tuition
and entrance fees may be paid, without breaking them down to their specific cost elements, are listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters addressed &sect;627.420(h), which establishes the requirement that recipient and subrecipient
procurements clearly specify deliverables and the basis for payment, and include specified clauses. A few comments
were received questioning the example that was given in the preamble to the interim final regulations of withholding
final payment to an OJT contractor until the participant has been retained on the job for a specified period of time
after the completion of training. The commenters wondered if the Department has predetermined deliverables for
OJT. The discussion was intended merely as an example and does not set a hard and fast rule for OJT contracts, although
the Department sees that such a contract provision might facilitate retention upon completion of OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final regulations, paragraph (h)(2) on required clauses is revised, to break it into three paragraphs: clauses
required for subrecipient awards; vendor awards; and vendor and subrecipient awards. In response to concerns expressed,
the applicability of clauses such as copyright and rights in data is narrowed. Several commenters correctly pointed
out that the regulations did not specify what the patent, copyright and rights and data clauses should be. The final
rule is amended to remove the requirement for patent rights (since it is not expected that many patentable items will
be developed using JTPA funds) and to include additional information on copyright and rights in data clauses. In the
case of the copyrights clause requirement, the application of this clause is limited to those awards which involve
the use or development of copyrighted materials. Also, the breach of award and termination clauses are expanded to
cover all awards. In the newly designated paragraph (h)(4)(i), which relates to breach of agreements, this clause
is now required to be included in all agreements, rather than be limited to those which exceed the small purchase limit.
The rationale for this change is that a breach in a small purchase situation can be as damaging to the JTPA program as
those in large dollar awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.420(i) establishes the requirement that recipients and subrecipients have written protest procedures.
A few comments were submitted on this section. One wondered how paragraph (i)(2), the referral of violations of law,
related to TEGL 6&hyph;84 and the incident reporting system. This section of the regulations is amended to reference
&sect;627.500(b) of the regulations, which establishes the referral requirements.

Selection of Service Providers

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.422 establishes the requirements for the selection of service providers. One commenter felt that the
selection of service providers should be essentially a blind process, in which the specific sector of the provider
is secondary to the provider's demonstrated ability. This is an accurate statement of the general intent of the Amendments
and of the Department in developing this section of the regulations. Given the large amount of funds that are budgeted
for JTPA titles II and III, it is important to ensure that procurements are done in a manner that will not only promote
the integrity of the process and the efficient expenditure of the monies but will also allow organizations an opportunity
to fairly compete to provide these services. Although it may be administratively easier to sole source the bulk of
the JTPA monies, this not only is unfair to the other potential service providers in a specific geographic area, but
it also could result in a diminution of the number of organizations that are able to provide services to the JTPA system
as well as in an increase of costs due to the lack of competition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter correctly pointed out that the first sentence of &sect;627.422(b) was missing a reference to recipients
and subrecipients. The final rule is amended accordingly. A small number of commenters wondered why the regulations
call for the Governor to establish guidelines on the selection of service providers, when the Act calls for the Secretary
to establish guidelines. The Secretary has established minimum guidelines through these regulations. The Governor
is given the authority to expand on these guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422(c) establishes the requirement that when a State, SDA, SSG, or administrative entity determines
that it will provide services, it must first make a determination, in writing, under the standards of &sect;627.422(d),
of the demonstrated performance of its staff. A number of commenters expressed concern that this section went beyond
the intent of the Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters argued that the ``self-determination'' requirement is inappropriate because it infringes
on the rights of PIC's or SDA's to make their own decisions on the mix of services according to local considerations.
The self-determination requirement implements the requirements of sections 107 (a) and (e) and 164(a)(3)(A) of
the Act for competitive selection of service providers. These requirements do reduce local discretion to the extent
that they prevent any SDA/SSG from selecting its service providers without adherence to the rules of a competitive
selection process. An SDA/SSG may not select an ``independent'' service provider without adhering to the competitive
procurement rules which is as much an intrusion on its discretion as is the requirement that it justify its selection
of an in-house service provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Act's new emphasis on competition in the procurement process is to ensure that the JTPA program provides
the best available services at the most advantageous price. This rationale is equally applicable no matter what the
identity of the service provider. Obtaining services through a competitive selection process enables decisionmakers
to periodically review the quality of, necessity for, and cost of the services that are being used. It would defeat
the purpose of the competitive selection process if one kind of service or one kind of service provider were exempted
from this periodic review. Thus, it is critical to the integrity of the competitive selection process that the selection
of all service providers, including in-house providers, be subject to periodic review and to regular redetermination
of the quality and cost effectiveness of the services provided as well as their responsiveness to the needs of the participants.
For this reason, the Department has decided to retain the self-determination requirement in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters thought that this requirement was not needed since the sanctions that occur for failure to meet performance
standards provide all the protection needed against arbitrary decisions to perform services in-house. It is true
that these available sanctions will help lead to a better program, but the earliest that they will lead to the increased
full and open competition required by the Amendments is after two or three years when performance standards are not
met and the sanctions are imposed. Since it is the Department's intent to increase competition immediately, it is
appropriate to impose the self-determination requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments revealed some confusion over the types of services that would be covered by the requirement of paragraph
(c). Several commenters indicated that intake and assessment should not be included as services that should be competitively
procured. Covered services, in the final regulations, are defined to exclude intake and eligibility determination,
which are services that are the basic responsibility of SDA's/SSG's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern expressed was that a vote by a PIC to provide an activity in-house will require the PIC to vote on a matter
that will directly benefit the JTPA agency. Since the enactment of JTPA and the formation of PIC's, PIC's have had to
make decisions and vote on the provision of services internally. This may well be an apparent conflict of interest,
but the conflict is inherent in the role of the PIC, and it is a conflict whether or not the SDA is required to justify the
decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, if the requirement for self-determination had not been established in the regulations, States, SDA's,
SSG's, and administrative entities for SDA's and SSG's would be required to compete all of the services. It is not the
Department's intent to require recipients and subrecipients to go through a full fledged competitive process or
to impose onerous procedural requirements, but merely to assure that they periodically consider whether the methods
by which the services are provided meet the Act's standards for cost and quality. For States, SDA's and SSG's that have
already been running programs in-house, the determination to keep services in-house will be relatively easy. The
determination will be more involved for SDA's and SSG's that propose to conduct services and activities which have
traditionally been contracted out and should have a rationale for so doing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters provided reasons why they provided services in-house. These reasons included avoiding brokerage
fees for OJT development and providing backup capacity if contractors fail. Both these reasons for performing these
services in-house are legitimate ones, which should suffice as part of the justification required by this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters wondered where the self-determination of demonstrated performance should be documented. Since
it is not expected that the documentation be voluminous, the Department believes that it would be appropriate for
recipient and subrecipient administrators to address the criteria listed in paragraph (d) in writing, in the JTP,
GCSSP or EDWAA plan. In the case of the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) that the service provider possess, ``[t]he
ability to meet the program design specifications at a reasonable cost,'' recipients and subrecipients need not
undertake extensive cost comparisons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422(d) implements the requirement in section 107(a) of the Act that the Secretary develop guidelines
on determining demonstrated performance. Concern was also expressed that use of CBO's might be restricted by the
requirement in paragraph (d)(1) that service providers have adequate financial resources or the ability to obtain
them. Comments indicated that many CBO's only support is JTPA programs and their financial stability rests with their
ability to win JTPA contracts. Where the reimbursement method is used, the entity must either have the financial resources
to cover expenses until reimbursed, or must be able to obtain the financial resources through loans, etc. In the case
of CBO's, many will be placed on an advance method of payment. As a result, the financial resources test is considerably
less stringent. Awarding agencies should, however, check the financial stability of all organizations in order
to determine that they possess the financial wherewithal to adequately undertake a JTPA program and whether they
are on the verge of bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422 (e) and (f) reiterate the language of section 107 (a) and (c) of the Act concerning CBO's and educational
institutions. These provisions must be interpreted in conjunction with the goal of the regulations to establish
an ``even playing field.'' CBO's and educational institutions are to be provided copies of any RFP's, etc. Any proposals
that are received from CBO's and educational institutions are to be reviewed and rated in the same manner as proposals
from any other organizations. It must be noted that the 90/10 arrangements authorized for use with CBO's or non-profits
are not to be taken into consideration in the rating criteria. Based on the special mention in the Act of CBO's, it would
be appropriate in instances where competing proposals are rated the same, to use as a tie-breaker the status of the
organization submitting the proposal (i.e., CBO). In the case of educational institutions that are providing education
services, the language in the Act is more prescriptive. Therefore, in the case of a tie, the award must go to the educational
institution, unless the organization does not pass the demonstrated performance test. Further, paragraph (e) is
clarified in the final rule so that it is easier to read. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some questions were raised concerning instances where Statewide procurement policies call for awarding extra points
to proposals received from such organizations as minority-business enterprises and women-owned businesses. If
this is a State, SDA or SSG-wide policy, applicable to not only JTPA funds but other funds, the State, SDA or SSG may continue
applying these policies to JTPA funds. If these policies apply only to JTPA funds, States, SDA's or SSG's may not continue
applying these policies to JTPA funds. This is discussed in a new paragraph (l). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.422(h) is redesignated as &sect;627.422(k) and reiterates the Act's requirement that awards include
appropriate amounts necessary for administration and supportive services (section 108(b)(5)). Several commenters
felt that SDA's/SSG's should be allowed to continue making awards that do not include administrative funds. It is
because of this practice that new language was included in the Amendments. In the past SDA's have indicated that, given
the 15 percent limitation on administrative costs, they do not receive sufficient administrative funds to operate
JTPA programs. It is equally difficult for other service providers to provide these same services when they are provided
either an even lower level of or no administrative funds. Some commenters thought that the regulations, as written,
will give service deliverers the right to claim whatever administrative costs they want. This is not the intent of
the regulation. While the regulation does prevent an SDA from arbitrarily refusing to fund a service provider's administrative
costs or from arbitrarily underfunding them, it creates no right in the service provider to demand any particular
level or amount of administrative funding. The level of administrative funding to be covered by the agreement should
be determined through negotiations. If either party is dissatisfied with the results of the negotiations, they should
not sign the agreement. Such disagreements may be handled under State and local grievance procedures. Some commenters
were concerned that awardees that fail to perform would argue that insufficient administrative funds were provided
and, thus, were the cause of the failure. Because the agreement should be mutual, it should be difficult for an awardee
to use this argument to excuse lack of performance. The Department does wish to note that it is inappropriate for the
SDA to pre-determine that it will not provide administrative costs for awardees except in the payment of tuition or
off-the-shelf prices. Others requested that guidance be given on how to determine appropriate amounts of administrative
funds. The Department thinks this type of clarification is more appropriately provided at the State level.

No comments were received on paragraphs 627.422 (i) and (k). These two paragraphs are redesignated as (h) and (j),
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The redesignated &sect;627.422(j) (now &sect;627.422(i)), which references back to section 204(d)(2)(B) of the
Act, deals with the selection of subrecipients for the provision of services to older workers. One commenter thought
that this section provides the justification for sole-sourcing older worker programs at the State level. This is
not the Department's intent. These programs are to be competed just like any other program. Others thought that only
the Governor has the responsibility for selecting service providers. With the addition of the pass-through provision
(at &sect;627.420(d)(2)), this does not have to be the case since the Governor can delegate his/her authority for
selection through the pass-through process.

Funding Restrictions for ``High-Risk'' Recipients and Subrecipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were submitted on &sect;627.423. Several of the commenters thought that this section was in conflict
with &sect;627.422(d), which requires a determination of demonstrated performance. The intent of this section
is not to give preferential status to high-risk recipients and subrecipients, but to provide JTPA entities with the
authority to impose funding restrictions should it be necessary to contract with such an entity. There may be instances
when awarding agencies have to make subrecipient awards to high-risk organizations because they are the only entity
providing the required service. By including this section, awarding entities may do so, but are authorized to include
restrictions on the award in order to protect the Federal funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters thought that the regulations, as written, would give high-risk grantees an argument that they have
a right to be considered and selected. This is not the case. This section does not confer a right of selection to high-risk
organizations. Given the choice of comparable proposals from an offeror who has demonstrated performance and a high-risk
recipient/subrecipient, the award should be made to the former, unless other factors indicate otherwise. Additional
language is added to &sect;627.422(d) to clarify these points. Finally, editorial changes are made to clarify that
this section applies to all awards, not just grants or subgrants.

Section 627.424 applies the Federal government-wide requirements on awards to debarred or suspended parties contained
in Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 and implemented for all Department of Labor grant programs in regulations codified
at 29 CFR part 98. These requirements were previously issued to JTPA Liaisons in a Grant Officer Notice dated April
30, 1992. As provided in 29 CFR part 98, certifications are not required for the State legislatively required ``pass-through''
of JTPA funds to SDA's/SSG's since these are considered ``mandatory awards'' and are, therefore, exempt from the
29 CFR part 98 requirements. However, any other subaward over $25,000, such as an SDA award with a service provider,
must meet the ``lower-tier'' certification. These ``lower-tier'' certifications are to remain with the respective
awarding agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that language be added to this section that tells States and subtier grantees that they may
elect to subscribe to the List of Parties Excluded from Procurement or Non-Procurement Programs. This has not been
done, since nothing in these regulations prohibits JTPA entities from subscribing to this publication, and using
it as a resource.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.425(b) of the interim final rule requires financial systems and procedures of recipients and subrecipients
to be in accordance with GAAP and &sect;627.435(a) requires costs charged to the JTPA program to also be in accordance
with GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised questions or issues about GAAP, including requesting that the Department be more specific
about how GAAP must be applied by States and SDAs, requesting specification of which GAAP to use, and, if GAAP is to be
determined by the Governor, if the Governor can waive GAAP provisions. A few commenters requested that the statutory
language of section 164(a)(1) of the Act pertaining to GAAP applicable in each State be included in &sect;627.425(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language is added to &sect;627.425(b) to provide for the applicability of GAAP in each State. The Department recognizes
that GAAP vary by type of organization or entity and that, while there is great similarity among them, multiple versions
of GAAP exist for each type of entity. It is the Department's intent, by adding this language, in addition to the language
in paragraph (a) of &sect;627.435, to allow the Governor to determine which specific versions of GAAP are to be used
in each State and by which types of entities, should this be at issue in any State. It is not intended to give the Governor
authority to waive GAAP provisions since the Act requires the use of GAAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``liabilities'' is added to the list of financial information that financial systems must include at &sect;627.425(b)(1)(i).

A few commenters indicated that revised financial reporting requirements need to be issued by the Department, consistent
with &sect;627.455, so that changes to accounting and other financial systems could be made that also meet the reporting
requirements. Revised financial reporting requirements for JTPA title II programs were issued by the Department
in Training and Employment Information Notice (TEIN) No. 6&hyph;93 dated July 30, 1993 (OMB No. 1205&hyph;0323).
Revised financial reporting requirements for title III programs were issued by the Department in TEIN's Nos. 14&hyph;93

In regard to participant data systems, a few commenters sought clarification regarding eligible applicants for

to make a determination of eligibility. The Department expects that such a determination will be made within a reasonable
time after the information is obtained.

Grant Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.430 establishes standards by which the Department will make payments to States as well as standards for
States, SDA's, SSG's, and other subrecipients for making payments to lower tier subrecipients. Included within
this section are standards for when advances to subrecipients are appropriate, when the reimbursement method is
appropriate, and provision is made for using the working capital advance payment method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters addressed the provisions of this section. A few commenters raised concerns related to the Cash
Management Improvement Act (CMIA) and primarily suggested that the Department should delay CMIA requirements since
SDA's/SSG's are waiting on the Department to publish CMIA standards. One commenter pointed out that at the current
time, the Treasury Department regulations at 31 CFR part 205 do not go beyond the State level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMIA applies only to States and does not carry through to subrecipients that are not a part of the State government.
The Treasury Department published final regulations to implement CMIA at 31 CFR Part 205 on September 24, 1992. The
Department does not plan to publish any additional CMIA standards applicable to grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that the September 24, 1992, Treasury Department regulations dropped the requirements
that previously existed pertaining to subrecipients of States as well as non-State recipients. Therefore, the basic
cash management standard of paragraph (b) of this section is revised to incorporate the standard that is generally
applicable to other Federal grant programs. That standard is also generally consistent with the standard applicable
to the JTPA program prior to the publication of the interim final rule. In addition, the requirement to maintain procedures
as a part of the standard is deleted so that the standard is based only on the demonstration of effective cash management
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters raised questions of whether subrecipients other than CBO's and non-profit entities could receive
advances or working capital advances. A few commenters wanted clarification on the specific requirements for payments
to contractors. It is the intent of this section to provide for advances to any subrecipient as long as the subrecipient
is in compliance with the basic cash management requirement that cash on hand shall be limited to actual immediate
disbursement needs for program purposes. A subrecipient that does not meet that standard may be paid by either of the
other two payment methods outlined in this section. The Department recognizes that, given the definitions in &sect;626.5
for subrecipient and contractor and the procurement requirements of the Act and these regulations, there is no need
to establish separate payment requirements applicable to contractors. Therefore, paragraph (b)(2) of the interim
final rule is removed from the final rule and corresponding language adjustments are made throughout the remainder
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested clarification of the requirement, in paragraph (f) of this section, which requires disbursement
of cash received as a result of program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest
earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments in light of the time frame for the use of program income
at &sect;627.450, Program income. The requirement in &sect;627.430(f) is a cash management requirement to ensure
that cash attributable to JTPA does not remain in a bank account while at the same time the entity is drawing additional
cash from the Treasury Department to meet immediate JTPA disbursement needs. Any cash attributable to JTPA should
be immediately disbursed for whatever JTPA disbursement need exists. That need does not have to be the same as the entity's
planned use of program income earnings nor does it relieve the entity of its liability to provide, within the funding
period, an amount of program services equivalent to the amount of program income earned. At the time cash is needed
for disbursement for the purposes for which the program income was planned to be used, it can be accessed through normal
JTPA grant payment processes. Language is added to paragraph (f) of &sect;627.430 to more clearly apply this requirement
to cash proceeds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.435 provides generic cost principles applicable to the JTPA program in paragraphs (a) through (d) and
provides specific treatment for selected items of cost in paragraphs (e) through (h). A few commenters stated that
the Department should adopt the Circulars for cost principles, thereby replacing this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 164(a)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations establishing uniform cost principles
substantially equivalent to those generally applicable to recipients of Federal grant funds. The generic cost principles
in this section are intended to be substantially the same as the provisions of Attachment A of the OMB Circulars that
contain cost principles and should generally be interpreted the same as the Circulars. The Department has chosen
not to simply adopt the Circulars because they contain some restrictive requirements in areas where the Department
thinks that recipients and subrecipients should retain operational flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters recommended that the prohibition on the shifting of funds in &sect;627.435(c) should be changed
to clarify that it does not cover accounting errors. The Department agrees with this comment and language is added
to limit this prohibition to costs ``allocable'' to another Federal grant, program, or category. Adjustments should
be made for costs inappropriately charged because of accounting errors or misclassification so that the costs ultimately
charged to a cost objective are those properly allocable to that objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested revision of the prohibition on contributions to contingency reserves at &sect;627.435(e)(6),
particularly that they should be allowable if such contributions are not made with Federal funds. The language on
contingency reserves is not changed since only those costs charged to the JTPA program are regulated by this section
and it does not extend to non-JTPA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amended &sect;627.435(f) provides additional guidance on legal costs. A number of commenters recommended changes
in this area, with most commenters opposed to the specific prohibition on the allowability of costs for appeals to
an Administrative Law Judge. Several commenters suggested that the Department should review the Conference Report
language on this issue. A few commenters requested more specificity on legal expenses, particularly settlement
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments received on the specific prohibition on the allowability of legal costs for appeals to
an Administrative Law Judge, the Department has reviewed the Conference Report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 102&hyph;811,
102d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 137 (1992)) and engaged in further dialogue on this subject. The discussion in section 221
of the Conference Report pertained to title IV special programs for Migrants and Seasonal Farmworkers and the Department
does not view that language as carrying through to the other titles of JTPA. The Department is also aware that some Federal
agencies are permitting the costs of appeals to an ALJ as an allowable grant cost. The Department notes that, unlike
the process of the Department of Health and Human Services that is referred to in the Conference Report, there are several
opportunities for informal resolution of disputes prior to the issuance of the Department of Labor grant officer's
final determination. In addition, if the grant officer's decision is found, upon appeal, to be substantially in error,
there may be an opportunity for a grantee to recover its legal costs under the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice
Act. Congress, in passing the Equal Access to Justice Act, has set forth the conditions under which it is appropriate
for parties in contested administrative proceedings to recover their costs from the federal government. The rule
that is adopted in these regulations maintains those conditions. Finally, it is the Department's position that,
absent any specific statutory direction, Federal taxpayers should not bear the costs of both sides of a matter appealed
to an ALJ. To do so may increase the incidence of such costs and provides no incentive for assuring that only matters
of substantive merit are appealed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the language on settlement costs, paragraph (f)(1) of this section is changed to clarify that settlement
costs are allowable to the extent that the costs included in the settlement would have been allowable if charged to
the JTPA program at the time they were incurred, e.g., if the settlement costs are for back pay then the provisions of
&sect;627.435(e)(2) would control the allowability of the settlement costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.435(h) of the interim final rule basically continued the language on construction costs that has existed
since the inception of JTPA. However, a few commenters recommended changes to this paragraph including that construction
costs for alterations, maintenance, and repairs should be allowable and that there is now a conflict with amended
&sect;627.210(a)(3) concerning physical accessibility, as required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with these comments and the language on construction costs is eliminated. The effect of this
change is to allow construction costs to the extent that such costs are necessary and allocable to JTPA. Paragraph
(h) of the final rule now contains language on contributions to a reserve for self-insurance, as discussed above in
the discussion of &sect;627.415(c), Insurance.

Governor's Guidelines on Allowable Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.435(i) requires the Governor to prescribe and implement guidelines on allowable costs not otherwise
treated in &sect;627.435 and contains a listing of selected items of costs in paragraph (i) for which the Governor's
allowable cost guidelines must, at a minimum, prescribe treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters responded to the provisions of this subsection. Most of them saw it as a requirement for Governors
to set actual amounts for salaries and other commonly incurred JTPA costs and opposed this subsection. One commenter
recommended that the Department should clarify the intent of this provision and a few commenters asked whether the
requirements of the regulation would be met if the OMB Circulars on cost principles were adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is not basically different from the requirement, in existence since the beginning of JTPA in 1983,
that ``[t]he Governor shall issue guidelines on allowable costs for *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Such guidelines should
set parameters and guidance, rather than actual amounts. The Department's intent is simply to ensure that the Governor's
guidelines cover at least the items included in the list, since issues have been raised on each of these items during
the past 10 years of JTPA. Recognizing that SDA's retain some flexibility, within the Governor's guidelines, to establish
amounts for allowable costs such as personnel compensation and travel, the final rule is changed by replacing the
words ``and amounts'' with ``or the extent of allowability.'' In addition, since other sections of the final rule
now provide guidelines on item No. 11, the extent of allowability for supportive services costs and payments to participants,
that item is removed from the list in this section of the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For most States, the existing allowable cost guidelines of the Governor already meet the requirements of this paragraph
and few, if any, changes are necessary. All States should review their current allowable cost guidelines and ensure
that each of the 16 listed cost items are treated consistently, as well as any other cost items for which the Governor
thinks consistent treatment is necessary. A commenter raised the question about whether the regulatory requirement
would be met if the OMB Circulars on Cost Principles were adopted. The Department agrees that all 16 cost items would
be covered if the Circulars were adopted. The Department cautions, however, that: (1) It does not intend to approve
or disapprove any prior approval requests, as required by the Circulars, and (2) the OMB Circulars contain restrictive
requirements in areas in which States, SDA's, and SSG's may desire greater flexibility, e.g., staff compensation,
fees/profits, fund-raising.

Administrative Cost Pools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.440(a) is amended in the final rule to add language on cost pools. Section 627.440(f) of the interim final
rule required that costs charged initially to a JTPA administrative cost pool (ACP) be allocated, for JTPA Federal
reporting purposes, to the benefitting programs based on the benefits received by each program. The Department recognized
that this language represented a departure from previously established policy on the manner in which pooled administrative
costs could be reported. Commenters were requested to identify the impact, if any, of the revised requirement to allocate
pooled administrative costs solely on the basis of ``benefits received''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters responded to the provisions of this paragraph. Most of the responses fell into one of three groups.
One group viewed the ACP language as effectively prohibiting ACP's by requiring detailed time distribution or some
type of cost allocation process for each item of joint administrative cost. These commenters thought the new requirements
involved too much recordkeeping, were an unreasonable burden, inefficient, illogical, and went beyond the requirements
of OMB Circular A&hyph;87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second group expressed concerns about the effect of the ACP requirement on the administrative cost limitations
for each program and that they would lose their ability to ensure cost limits are not exceeded. They were also concerned
programs would be overexpended. A few commenters stated that there are not enough administrative funds available
for EDWAA at the State level to absorb its share of costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third group of commenters made suggestions that included going back to the old regulatory language, which allowed
``true cost pools'', specifying that using direct expenditures was an acceptable methodology, and requiring application
of A&hyph;87 principles. One commenter suggested eliminating any mention of ACP's in the regulations and, instead,
requiring JTPA entities to follow GAAP and section 108(a) of the Act. In addition, a few commenters requested guidance
on the use of intake cost pools. Several commenters raised questions about the proper charging of title II&hyph;B
administrative costs at the State level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also raised questions about the ``benefits received'' language of paragraph (a) in &sect;627.440,
which requires all JTPA costs to be charged to the benefitting programs and cost categories based on benefits received.
That language has been a part of the JTPA regulations since the inception of the program. A few commenters recommended
that this paragraph should specifically allow cost pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACP language contained in &sect;627.440(f) of the interim final rule was not intended to eliminate the use of ``true
cost pools'' in accounting for the costs of JTPA programs. It was also not intended to go beyond the requirements of
section 108(a) of the Act, GAAP, paragraph (a) of this section or similar provisions in OMB Circular A&hyph;87. The
final rule removes the specific ACP provisions in paragraph (f) and adds a new sentence on cost pools within paragraph
(a). The new sentence is intended to be consistent with the A&hyph;87 meaning and treatment of cost pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JTPA entities may continue to use ACP's. They may also continue to use indirect cost pools, training cost pools, intake
cost pools, pools for supplies expense, and any other pool they find beneficial to have in their accounting system,
including intermediate cost pools for the recording and temporary accumulation of joint or similar types of costs,
pending distribution (allocation) at a later date to the benefitting cost objectives, e.g., programs and/or JTPA
cost categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having, or using, a JTPA ACP has never been an issue and is not one now. The issue is how to distribute or allocate those
accumulated costs back to the benefitting programs and whether allocation methodologies other than ``benefits
received'' by each of the benefitting programs can be used. The ``old'' JTPA regulations did not address this issue.
Since the 1992 Amendments directly incorporate the requirement to follow GAAP, and GAAP requires costs to be charged
based on ``benefits received,'' the basic issue is whether the Department can waive a specific statutory requirement,
especially when it affects up to 20 percent of the funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Department's experience that allocation based on ``benefits received'' has not added much workload burden
and alternative methodologies have been developed by most JTPA entities. For many JTPA entities, allocating administrative
costs based on each program's share of total direct costs, salaries and fringe benefits, or total program costs compared
to the total direct costs, total salaries and fringe benefits, or total costs of all programs administered by an entity
are acceptable methodologies. The Department cautions, however, that some of these methodologies may not be acceptable
for particular JTPA entities. Each organization is different and costs, particularly direct costs, are charged
differently. It will require a self-examination by each entity to determine the best approach. Assistance can also
be obtained from the State's or SDA's auditor. The use of financial-based methodologies is encouraged; however,
the Department will accept any treatment of pooled costs and allocation methodologies that are consistent with GAAP
applicable in each State. The Department cautions that a methodology that is based solely on contribution to the pool
may be questioned in audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in response to the questions about the proper charging of title II&hyph;B administrative costs at the State
level, &sect;627.440(b) establishes the JTPA cost objectives for State-administered programs and the State's
overall administration of title II activities. To clarify this issue, however, &sect;627.440(b)(10) is revised
in the final rule to specifically include State administrative costs associated with title II&hyph;B.

Classification of Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.440 establishes the minimum levels of accountability for JTPA funds, provides the Secretary's definitions
of the cost categories, and provides specific treatment for the classification of certain types of costs that have
frequently been at issue in the JTPA system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;627.440(c)(2), the regulations provide that incentive funds, both title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, received
by an SDA may be combined and used without regard to cost categories or cost limitations. A number of commenters on this
provision were pleased with the treatment accorded incentive funds, however, several commenters appeared to have
missed or misread this provision. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the definitions of the JTPA cost categories, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.440(d), a number of comments expressed concern about the treatment of tuition, work experience wages,
insurance, and the difference between public information costs and the costs of outreach. Another frequent comment
concerned the treatment of project directors and other positions that perform both administrative and program functions.
Commenters on this subject fell into two groups. One group, which appeared to have missed the provisions of paragraph
(e)(1), argued that the costs of such positions should not all be charged to administration. Some requested that such
positions be charged entirely to training. The other group, focusing on paragraph (e)(1), commented on the burden
and mechanics of time distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the language in the preamble of the interim final rule concerning tuition was somewhat
inconsistent and more restrictive than this section of the regulations. The Department's intent is to permit costs
frequently associated with tuition costs, such as entrance fees, to also be charged to the direct training category.
The Department believes that the regulation adequately expresses this intent. In addition, tuition, entrance fees,
and other usual and customary fees of other educational institutions, such as postsecondary vocational institutions
specified at section 481(c) of the Higher Education Act, are another example of payments to vendors that are appropriately
charged to the direct training category. The final rule removes the reference to section 141(d)(3)(B) of the Act to
clarify that such payments to any educational institution in a vendor relationship that also satisfies the other
criteria of paragraph (d)(1)(vi)(B), are direct training costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where tuition is part of a subrecipient agreement, rather than a vendor relationship, and the agreement also includes
other components, the costs of tuition are chargeable to the direct training category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d)(1)(vii) is added to the final rule specifying that payments to participants that represent hours
spent in a direct training activity (such as work experience) are direct training costs. In addition, the word ``insurance''
is removed from the definition of administration since this is a type of cost that should be charged or allocated to
each of the benefitting categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised the question of how the costs of curriculum development or training materials should be charged.
The Department believes that these costs are properly charged to the direct training cost category.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few comments were received on public relations costs versus the costs of outreach. These comments tended to view
public relations as an outreach cost and recommended that it be charged to the training related and supportive services
category. The Department agrees that public relations can be an effective tool that enhances outreach activity,
but also believes that the costs of general public relations is more appropriately a part of the overall costs of administration.
No change is made in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also agrees with commenters that time distribution should be reasonable and not burdensome and that
alternative distribution bases should be allowable. Language is added to paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(3)(i), and
(e)(1) to provide that other equitable cost allocation methods may be used. Other equitable cost allocation methods
may be either financial based or non-financial based methods.

Limitations on Certain Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.445(d) of the interim final rule clarified the provision made in section 141(d)(3)(C) of the Act for excluding
administrative costs incurred by CBO's or non-profit organizations from the SDA's administrative cost limitation
under certain criteria and conditions specified in the Amendments. A number of commenters responded to that provision
and regulatory clarification. Most of these commenters incorrectly perceived the 10-percent limitation as an absolute
ceiling on administrative costs for CBO's and other non-profit service providers and requested relief from that
ceiling. Other commenters raised questions of whether the 90/10 provisions were based on budget or actual expenditures
and the effect on the 90/10 provision if more than 10 percent is expended by the CBO or other non-profit service provider
for administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department emphasizes that the provisions of section 141(d)(3)(C) of the Act and paragraph (d) of the regulations
do not constitute a mandatory ceiling on administrative costs for CBO's and other non-profit service providers.
The relief provisions apply to the SDA's administrative cost limitation and are only applicable for those situations
in which the SDA and the CBO or other non-profit service provider agree to the 90/10 arrangement. Where such agreement
is reached, the SDA may avail itself of the relief to total administrative costs only if the actual expenditures of
the CBO or other non-profit service provider conforms to the 90/10 provisions. Costs charged to the JTPA program for
the costs of a CBO or other non-profit service provider that are for less than 90 percent for direct training and training-related
and supportive services costs or for more than 10 percent for administrative costs negate the applicability of this
provision.

Program Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.450 contains a definition of what is and what is not program income for JTPA purposes, including the incorporation
of the new provisions of section 141(m) of the Act, and establishes timeframes and requirements for the treatment
and use of program income. The JTPA cost categories and the administrative cost limitations are also made applicable
to program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters responded to the provisions of this section. The comments contained a number of suggestions,
including: That the Department should adopt the OMB Circular A&hyph;102 definition of program income; that program
income should not be subject to the cost categories or administrative cost limitation; and that the regulations should
eliminate the presumption that a contractor is entitled to the earned revenues by law, especially a contractor with
whom the State or SDA is no longer contracting. Other commenters raised the question of whether earned program income
must be used for the same program or subtitle that earned it and still others requested clarification of the time frame
for use of program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's intent to adopt the basic A&hyph;102 definition of program income and to add to that definition
the specific provisions of section 141(m) of the Act. In addition, the Department recognizes that the potential to
earn significant amounts of program income exists within the Act and these regulations. To avoid the possibility
of creating windfalls of administrative funds available to entities that choose to use the new provisions in such
a manner, the Department is imposing the administrative cost limitation on program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141(m) of the Act specifies that program income may be retained by the entity that earned it and used for program
purposes. The Department believes that the regulations, as written, are consistent with the statutory provision
and that there is no authority to empower any other entity to use the funds, as long as the entity that earned the program
income uses the funds for program purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the questions about whether program income must be used for the same program or subtitle that earned
it, or if it may be used for any JTPA program or title, the Department agrees that clarification is needed. While the
interim final regulations limited the use of program income to the particular JTPA grant or subgrant under which it
was earned, it is recognized that particular grants or subgrants may provide funds for multiple programs or subtitles.
Therefore, paragraph (c) of this section of the final rule is amended to also limit its use to the JTPA title under which
it was earned. In addition, language is added to paragraph (c)(3) to clarify that the time period for the use of program
income is the funding period, usually up to three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was brought to the Department's attention that section 141(m) of the Act does not exempt interest earnings by States
from the provisions applicable to income under the Act and, therefore, the regulations could not either. The Department
agrees, however, the State is required by the CMIA, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6503(c), to pay interest on advanced funds
from the time that the funds are deposited by the United States to the State's account until the time that the funds are
paid out by the State for program purposes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that it is equitable that the State be able to use the interest it may earn on these funds towards
satisfying the interest debt created by the CMIA and does not desire to cause States to both meet any interest liability
under the CMIA and provide additional JTPA program services with the same interest earnings. Therefore, paragraph
(a)(v) is revised in the final rule to eliminate the exception for interest earnings by States and paragraph (c), Use
of program income, is revised to permit the State's use of such income to meet its CMIA liability. In addition, the application
of the administrative cost limitations in paragraph (c) is also revised to exempt program income used by States to
meet its CMIA liability from the administrative cost limitation.

Reports Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.455 requires financial reporting to be on a quarterly basis and costs to be reported on an accrual basis
by year of appropriation. A few commenters asked whether participants must also be reported by year of appropriation
and several commenters asked whether costs may be charged to the oldest available appropriation, i.e., first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As specified in &sect;627.455(a), reporting instructions are to be issued by the Secretary. The statutory requirement
to report by year of appropriation is limited to financial data. With regard to FIFOing of costs, the Department has
no objections to an entity FIFOing costs it incurs itself as long as obligational authority exists for multiple years
and the costs are for the same purposes and under the same terms and conditions that accompanied each year's obligational
authority. This approach limits FIFOing to each individual JTPA entity and does not include one entity FIFOing costs
incurred by another entity, even if the other entity is a subrecipient of the original one. Restated, once a JTPA cost
is recorded by any subrecipient, it must be recorded against a given year of funds and remains a cost charged to that
year of funds. It may not be recorded or reported by another entity against a different year of funds. No changes are
made to the final rule.

Requirements for Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.460(a) imposes the record retention requirements of section 165(e) of the Act on State records and provides
the State two options for subrecipient records. A few commenters encouraged the Department to drop the option for
subrecipient records and require all subrecipients to comply with the record retention provisions imposed on subrecipients
by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Act is unclear about its effect on subrecipient records, it is the Department's intent, by providing an option
for retention of subrecipient records, to allow each State to determine if subrecipients of the State should each
have its own clock for the starting point for record retention, rather than having all records of all subrecipients
throughout a State controlled by the one State clock. This option avoids requiring all subrecipients in a State to
maintain records beyond the prescribed period just because a claim, audit, or litigation has started that affects
only one or a few subrecipients. It also enables JTPA subrecipients to maintain and dispose of JTPA records in the same
timeframes that apply to other records of the subrecipient that are covered by applicable OMB Circulars. It is expected
that either approach will result in most JTPA records, other than property records, being maintained for the same
total 5-year period of time. Subrecipients that are opposed to this approach should encourage their State to not adopt
the option provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is changed in the final rule to add the statutory requirement for property records
to be retained for three years after final disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.460(d) of the interim final regulations authorizes the substitution of copies made by microfilming
for original records. A few commenters raised questions about the allowability of retaining records in forms other
than microfilming, such as computer imaging or scanning, and other types of computer generated data and electronic
files. In response to these comments, the Department has revised this provision. Instead of authorizing a particular
medium for record retention, the revised provision sets a standard that the method of retention must be sufficient
to assure that the record is useable as evidence in an audit or any other JTPA proceeding. As before, the substitution
of microfilmed or photocopied records can continue to be used since these media are generally accepted as admissible
for evidentiary purposes. The Department takes no position on the use of records stored on electronic media and the
revised regulation neither authorizes nor specifically forbids their use. If electronic storage media were to be
considered for use, the user would have to be certain that there are sufficient security safeguards and protections
against tampering so that a court would accept the record as evidence in a proceeding. As in any case where a record is
maintained, the burden of producing and authenticating it is on the custodian of the record and the failure to authenticate
the record will lead to the custodian's being unable to use the record for any evidentiary purpose. Thus, if an SDA maintains
its participant eligibility records on computer files and is unable to show that the records were secure or were tamperproof,
the records could not be used to prove that participants were eligible for JTPA services.

Public Access to Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 165(a)(4) of the Act requires recipients to make available to the public upon request certain records which
are maintained by the recipients pursuant to section 165(a)(1) of the Act. Section 637.463 of the interim final rule
was intended to merely reflect the statutory requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments were received expressing concerns that such disclosure would result in the invasion of personal
privacy and would breach basic notions of customer confidentiality. In this same regard, some comments contended
that this requirement conflicts with State privacy laws and that the statement in the regulation with this requirement
applied ``notwithstanding the provisions of state or local law'' goes beyond the plain meaning of section 165(a)(4)
of the Act. Another comment asked for a definition of the word ``clearly'' in the term ``clearly unwarranted invasion
of privacy''. One comment questioned the provision in the regulation ``excepting'' recipient and subrecipient
records from the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Several comments requested that the regulations place
reasonable time and place restrictions on the right of access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 627.463 is revised to follow more closely the statutory language. There is no intent to modify or expand on
the plain meaning of the statute.

It is clear that reasonable conditions can be placed on the mechanics of providing access, including time and place
restrictions. It is preferable that such management details be developed at the State and local levels and not in these
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute and the regulations permit customer confidentiality by excluding from mandatory disclosure information
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. A Federal definition of that phrase is
unnecessary since it is a term best defined in local situations by State or local law. A State or local privacy law or
requirement which prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information which constitutes an unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy would not be in conflict with the JTPA public access requirement. On the other hand, the Act's requirement
of public access is a statutory condition to the receipt of grant funds and a conflicting State requirement does not
excuse a failure to comply. In other words, if a State or local law applicable to all records exempts certain specific
kinds of identifying information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 name, address, social security number or other personal identifying information), it could be applied to restrict
the disclosure of some of the information in a JTPA applicant's or participant's file. On the other hand, a State or
local law which prohibited disclosure of all employment and training records would sweep so broadly that it would
conflict with the Act's disclosure requirement. In order to emphasize that requirement, the informational provision
in the regulation that the public access requirement applies ``notwithstanding the provision of the State or local
law'' is retained in the final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``informational'' statement regarding the Freedom of Information Act produced some confusion and is removed
from the final regulation. The only reason this statement was put into the interim final regulation was that the coverage,
or non-coverage, of the Federal Freedom of Information Act has been a recurring subject of inquiry. The Freedom of
Information Act applies to the disclosure of records in the custody of Federal agencies. In like manner, the Privacy
Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) applies to records described in section 165 of the Act. Section 627.460 records are not Federal
records until submitted to the Secretary. Until then, they are not covered by federal ``freedom of information''
or ``privacy'' requirements.

Section 627.465 reflects the requirements of section 141(r) of the Act, which provides that the Federal requirements
generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments are the requirements governing the title,
use, and disposition of real property, equipment, and supplies purchased with JTPA funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments are codified for
Department of Labor grant programs at 29 CFR part 97. Therefore, the provisions of those regulations applicable to
property requirements are incorporated into this section for governmental recipients and subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal requirements generally applicable to Federal grants to States and local governments provide that subrecipients
that are institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations will follow the Federal
agency regulations that implement OMB Circular A&hyph;110, as codified in DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 95 (59 FR
38270 (July 27, 1994), therefore, those requirements are also incorporated into this section for those types of entities.
It is expected that this approach will provide administrative relief for such subrecipients since it will prevent
an organization administering other Federal grants or subgrants from having to follow two different sets of requirements.
In addition, the Federal requirements applicable to intangible personal property have been incorporated into this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no Federal requirements generally applicable to commercial subrecipients; therefore, &sect;627.465(c)
provides specific JTPA requirements for these organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small number of commenters raised the question of whether prior approval by the Department of Labor is necessary
for property acquisitions. Language is added to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to waive any Department of Labor
prior approvals relative to property acquisitions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.465 specifically provides that the new rules apply only to property acquired after July 1, 1993. Several
commenters inquired about the rules applicable to property acquired prior to July 1, 1993. It was the Department's
intent in the interim final rule that such property would continue to be governed by the rules in effect at the time the
property was acquired. To ensure that this intent is explicit, the previous JTPA regulations on property are added
as a new paragraph (e) in the final rule. The only change is the citation for records retention requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JTPA regulations in effect prior to July 1, 1993, provided that the Governor was to maintain accountability for
property in accordance with State procedures, but applied three specific Federal requirements: (1) A reservation
of the Secretary's rights to such property; (2) record retention requirements; and (3) either reimbursement to the
JTPA program of the fair-market value for any unneeded JTPA acquired property retained for use in a non-JTPA program
or the use of proceeds from the sale of such property used for JTPA purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that the Department has no rights in property acquired with title II or III funds awarded to States
from the inception of JTPA in 1983 through July 1, 1993, but that the Department does have rights in property transferred
to JTPA from CETA. Therefore, as long as the proceeds from the sale of JTPA acquired property or the fair-market value
of such property transferred to other uses are expended for JTPA purposes and records maintained accordingly, the
Department views any further requirements governing such property to be the responsibility of the Governor. For
CETA-acquired property transferred to JTPA, the Department's rights in such property are specified in the current
Department regulations implementing the applicable OMB Circulars. Recipients and subrecipients are expected
to follow those regulations in disposing of CETA-acquired property.

Performance Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to adult and youth programs under title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and dislocated workers under title III,
&sect;627.470 provides for the establishment of performance standards for older worker programs under section
204(d) of the Act. The standards for both adults and youth may include standards for employment competencies which
are to be based on such factors as entry-level skills and other hiring requirements. The purpose of the performance
standards guidance set forth in these regulations is to establish the general requirements for implementing title
II&hyph;A, title II&hyph;C, and title III performance standards. Specific policy requirements will be developed
in consultation with the JTPA system and will be subject to a formal public comment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters asked when the new performance standards requirements would take effect. Current performance
standards measures and implementing provisions, as specified in TEGL's 10&hyph;89, 7&hyph;91, and 11&hyph;92,
will remain in effect through Program Year (PY) 1993. In accordance with the transition provision of section 701(b)
of the JTPA Amendments, revised performance standards were published July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35381 (July 11, 1994); standards
pertaining to 6-month retention in unsubsidized employment shall not take effect before July 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to setting 6-month retention standards, several commenters advised the Department to conduct a study to
identify and address technical issues related to using Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records to document placement
and retention of participants. In preparation for developing and implementing policy in this regard, the Department
of Labor has already undertaken a study to examine the technical and operational issues associated with the use of
UI wage records for the purpose of implementing performance standards related to employment retention. The study
was conducted in 16 States and focused on such issues as quality of data, timing for incentives, and out-of-State and
uncovered employment. The results of the study will be available in the fall of 1994 and will provide important input
into the decisionmaking process and guidelines for implementing the 6-month retention standard. The Department
recognizes that there will be a variety of issues to be addressed in developing and implementing a retention standard.
When the results of the study are available, the Department will work with State and local staff to introduce, wherever
feasible, alternative post-program measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is important to note that interim credit, which a few commenters believed should be incorporated in
the performance standards, will be considered in the development process. The Department emphasizes, however,
that there is no maximum participation limit and no Department-imposed requirement that everyone be terminated
at the end of a given program year. Performance standards are based only on those individuals who do, in fact, terminate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters provided advice on implementing the performance standards required under section 204(d)
of the Act, which implies that these standards are to parallel those developed for title II programs. While the specifics
of older worker performance standards will not be addressed in the regulations, the process for developing these
standards began in the summer of 1993. Program experts and advocate groups for older workers were consulted in developing
performance standards for older workers programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in response to other comments recommending adoption of performance standards for adults based on competency
attainment, it is important to note that skill acquisition for adults is included among several possible performance
standards factors identified in section 106(b)(3)(E) of the Act. In order to insure that any standards established
for skill acquisition are fair and practical, the Department has begun to collect relevant administrative data and
also to examine experience with youth employment competencies and initiatives, such as the Secretary's Commission
on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) and apprenticeship programs. In addition, beginning in 1994 the Department
will consult with academics and program practitioners to determine practical approaches to defining adult competencies.
Performance standards for adult skill acquisition will be issued in PY 1996, at the earliest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of the older worker program, the Governor is responsible for establishing an incentive policy
that rewards performance in title II programs and for: (1) Establishing a process for adjusting performance standards
to account for local conditions, and (2) providing technical assistance to SDA's which fail to meet performance standards
for a given program year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters voiced concern that a performance standard relating to costs might be required. Accordingly,
&sect;627.470(c)(2) is amended to clarify that Governors may not tie standards relating gross program expenditures
to performance measures in making incentive awards. Governors are encouraged to make full use of available expenditure
and participant data in monitoring SDA fiscal practices; at the same time, SDA's should closely monitor local service
providers. States and SDA's are encouraged to explore ways of relating overall costs of job training to long-term
employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulation also incorporates the requirement, in section 106(j) of the Act, for the imposition of a reorganization
plan on SDA's failing for 2 consecutive years to meet an appropriate proportion of the performance standards, with
the exception of the older worker programs. The Governor is to notify the Secretary and the SDA of the continued failure
and to impose a reorganization plan within 90 days of the end of the second program year; otherwise, the Secretary will
develop and impose the reorganization plan. As mentioned before, with regard to the 90-day deadline for imposing
sanctions, a few commenters believed that 90 days was insufficient time for States to evaluate and implement an effective
reorganization plan. In addition, a few commenters sought clarification of what might constitute the imposition
of a reorganization plan. The Department acknowledges that there may be some difficulty in timing but points to the
language in section 106(j)(5)(A) of the Act. In response to the latter comments and in an attempt to alleviate the level
of concern about the imposition of a reorganization plan, the final rule is amended by adding a new paragraph (c)(4)(iv)
to &sect;627.470 which provides the minimum requirements for the imposition of a reorganization plan. The Secretary
will give the Governor and the SDA 30 days in which to comment to the Secretary on the proposed reorganization plan prior
to its imposition. Further, the Secretary will recapture or withhold up to one-fifth of the State's administration
set-aside to provide technical assistance to an SDA where the Secretary has imposed the reorganization plan or where
the Governor has not provided appropriate technical assistance.

Oversight and Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received on oversight and monitoring. Section 627.475 summarizes the roles of each administrative
level in a comprehensive monitoring and oversight system. The monitoring provisions are expanded to require the
Governor to develop a monitoring plan which requires that each SDA and SSG be monitored at least once annually. The
plan must also require the collection and review of sufficient information to enable the Governor to determine whether
substate entities have demonstrated substantial compliance with the oversight requirement to permit a waiver of
the imposition of sanctions authorized under section 164(e) of the Act, or to determine whether a job training plan
should be disapproved pursuant to section 105 of the Act. The regulations also require the Governor to be responsible
for issuing standards to SDA's and SSG's for the development of a local monitoring plan. Additionally, the regulations
require the Governor to develop general standards for PIC oversight responsibility for inclusion in the Governor's
coordination and special services plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the Department of Labor provide greater details regarding its own monitoring responsibilities
as well as those of the States. The Department is in the process of developing guidance in this area and, when completed,
will provide more detailed information on monitoring and oversight through administrative issuances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter observed that the emphasis in paragraph (b)(3) was unnecessarily on criteria for disapproval of the
plan when, in fact, the Act called for the Governor to approve a plan unless it did not meet certain criteria. The commenter
suggested that paragraph (b)(3) be revised to read ``Determines that a job training plan shall be disapproved if the
plan does not meet the criteria established in section 105(b)(1) of the Act which states in part, the Governor shall
approve the job training plan or modification thereof unless he finds that the plan does meet the criteria found in
section 105(b)(1)''. The Department concurs with this comment and, although the Department did not adopt the suggestion

in toto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, paragraph (b)(3) is revised to better reflect the statutory criteria for disapproval of the job training plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested clarification of what elements of an SDA's and SSG's operation must be monitored not less
than once annually. The Department believes that an effective monitoring program is important to improving or maintaining
high levels of program performance. The Department wishes to provide states with flexibility in designing the nature
and extent of their monitoring programs while assuring that monitoring is thorough. Paragraph (b)(5) is revised
to indicate that all aspects of the SDA and SSG program must be reviewed annually, although the Department wishes to
clarify that the degree of emphasis placed upon the review of each area of a program may vary from year to year.

A few commenters expressed concern with the PIC responsibility for oversight as it relates to the Governor and the
chief elected official. The commenters suggested that the PIC should be allowed flexibility to determine the type
and amount of PIC oversight. Section 103(a) of the Act states that it shall be the responsibility of the PIC to provide
policy guidance for, and exercise oversight with respect to, activities under the job training plan for its SDA in
partnership with the unit or units of local government within its SDA. The Department agrees that it is primarily the
responsibility of the PIC to determine its monitoring and oversight role. While the regulations give the Governor
a role in PIC oversight in an overall context, the Department does not expect any guidelines issued by the Governor
to be overly prescriptive. Therefore, the PIC should have a great deal of flexibility in setting its monitoring role.
No change is made to the final regulation.

In reviewing the interim final regulations, the Department realized that it had not fully implemented section 164(b)
of the Act in the regulations. Sections 627.477 and 627.607 are added to complete the regulatory implementation of
section 164(b) regarding the Governor's actions where there are substantial violations of the Act or the regulations
and corrective actions have not been taken. Conforming changes have been made in &sect;&sect;627.601(b), 627.471(a)
and 627.702. These added provisions and changes are not intended to modify or expand on the plain meaning of the statute.

Because there are both non-profit and commercial organizations which are direct recipients of JTPA Title III program
funds, the language at &sect;627.480(a)(2) and (3) is modified by the addition of the term ``recipients'', as well
as by substituting the term ``organizations'' for ``subrecipient'' in paragraph (a)(2). The interim final regulations
implied that non-profit and commercial organizations can only be subrecipients.

Audits of Commercial Organizations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised questions concerning the audit requirement for ``commercial organizations''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wanted clarification concerning whether or not the audits of proprietary schools, which are required
by the U.S. Department of Education because of their involvement with Pell grants and other subsidies, would satisfy
the JTPA audit requirement. One commenter was concerned that the regulation did not provide a timeframe within which
these audits were to be completed, and another expressed concern that the requirement for an annual audit was more
frequent than that for non-profit institutions. The regulation, at &sect;627.480(a)(3), is amended to provide
for audit timeframes and frequencies that are consistent with the OMB Circular A&hyph;133 requirements for non-profit
organizations. This provision also provides the option of either a Federal funds audit or an organization-wide audit
as long as the audit includes financial and compliance coverage of the JTPA program within its scope. The option of
a Federal funds audit should be satisfied by the audit required by the U.S. Department of Education so long as it includes
financial and compliance coverage of the JTPA program within its scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested clarification concerning the audit requirement for OJT employers, commercial off-the-shelf
training packages, tuition-based individual referral contracts, and other ``vendor'' type arrangements. The
regulation imposes an audit requirement only on organizations that are ``subrecipients'' and not on those that are
``vendors''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked if the regulation prohibited a Governor (this would also apply to any awarding agency) from
procuring a program specific audit for commercial organizations and directing them to exclude JTPA from their organization-wide
audit. The regulation only talks to the requirement to have an audit done, not to who will procure and/or conduct the
audit. If the awarding agency and its subrecipient agree that the awarding agency will procure and/or conduct the
audit, the requirement of the regulation would be satisfied.

A few commenters had difficulty with the language at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.480(d). One of these commenters thought that the regulation went beyond OMB Circular A&hyph;128 and required
that debt collection be completed within the 6-month resolution period. This is not the case. When costs are disallowed
and debt collection is the appropriate sanction, those efforts should be initiated or started within the 6 month period.
This often is accomplished by including appropriate language in a final determination. However, the actual repayment
most often occurs after the 6-month resolution period. Also, debt collection efforts are often put on hold when a final
determination is appealed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these concerns, the parenthetical reference in paragraph (d)(2) is moved to the end, and the phrase ``where

One commenter pointed out a conflict between &sect;627.480(f) and &sect;627.704(a). Paragraph (f) is removed from

Stand-in Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were a number of commenters who raised concerns and questions about &sect;627.480(g), which is now redesignated
as paragraph (f). Several of these commenters were among those who commented on the definition of ``stand-in costs''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters indicated that stand-in costs should not have to be from the same cost category as the unallowable
costs. Others pointed out the discrepancy between the definition and this regulation concerning the time when such
costs were incurred. As a result, the last sentence of redesignated paragraph (f) is revised so that both it and the
definition at &sect;626.5 state that the costs are to be from the same program year and that the substitution cannot
result in a violation of the applicable cost limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that ``stand-in costs'' should be allowed as substitutes regardless of the year or program/title
that generates them. Such an interpretation runs counter to the intuitive concept of substituting to make whole the
program that bore the cost of the misexpenditures. It is also contrary to ETA's interpretation of the General Accounting
Office (GAO) Comptroller General decision which is the basis for the position on ``stand-in'' costs. The GAO-decision
indicates that, when an audit reveals total allowable program costs which exceed the total amount authorized and
paid with program funds, the resolving agency is obligated to accept those program costs as substitutes for disallowed
costs. This is true because funds which become available due to the disallowance of costs should be treated as funds
never expended by the auditee. Thus, the stand-in process constitutes a part of the totality of allowed and disallowed
costs which occurs at the audit resolution stage before a collectible debt is established. The regulation, at &sect;627.480(f),
is written to incorporate this concept of substitution for unallowable costs incurred by the auditee when the stand-in
costs are reported (on the JTPA quarterly financial report form) and accounted for in the auditee's financial system,
and are included within the scope of the auditee's audit report. Although potential stand-in costs are aggregated
for reporting purposes only, this does not create a pool of stand-in costs at the higher tier when funds are merely passed
through from one level to the next (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 State to SDA or other government entity). When ``stand-in'' costs are reported on the JTPA quarterly financial report
and included within the scope of an entity's audit, they are readily identifiable and available to substitute for
unallowable costs identified in the same report. This is important because by the time an audit report is finally resolved,
the three-year availability period for the costs disallowed has often lapsed or is nearing its end. By having contemporaneous
allowable JTPA costs incurred (but paid for with local resources) during the same period as the unallowable costs,
there is no question about the propriety of the substitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters raised questions concerning the requirement to report ``stand-in costs''. A few asked if they needed
to be reported on the quarterly reports required by the Department. One asked if these costs could be reported after
the fact only when needed, instead of being reported whether or not an SDA is permitted to and/or needs use them. Others
suggested that they should be allowed even if not reported. One suggested that the requirement to report exceeded
the statutory requirement that they be recorded. As explained above, it is ETA's position that ``stand-in costs''
must be subjected to audit coverage in order to be accepted. Imposing the requirement that the costs be reported and
providing a line for these costs on the JTPA quarterly financial report(s), insures that these costs are included
within the scope of the audit report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested that the JTPA compliance supplements for OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 audits
be revised to require that such audits include a separate schedule for ``stand-in costs'' and to specify the documentation
requirements for same. The documentation requirements, including retention requirements, are the same as for all
JTPA costs incurred. While the Department is not in a position to dictate whether A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 audits
include an additional schedule, when the compliance supplements are revised, it may be possible to suggest how ``stand-in
costs'' should be treated in such audits.

Direct Appeals by SDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that &sect;627.480(h) should be revised to provide the right of a direct appeal by an
SDA, especially in those instances when a State chooses not to appeal. However, the initial and final determination
process utilized by the ETA Grant Officer imposes a sanction on the direct recipient of funds from ETA, and it is that
recipient that ETA holds liable for the sanction. If the entity upon whom the sanction is imposed chooses not to appeal,
there is no dispute between that entity and ETA. If an appeal of a Grant Officer's final determination is taken, affected
subrecipients are permitted to intervene in the proceedings. An SDA has the right to appeal any adverse determination
against it within the State appeal system.

Audit Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 627.481 is not changed from the interim final regulations. One commenter suggested that &sect;627.481(a)(1)
should permit direct recipients to have 6 months within which to submit their resolution report. The Department believes
that to do so would mean that the recipient's audit would not be resolved with its awarding agency within the 6 months
required by the OMB Circulars. Another commenter suggested that the title for the paragraph at &sect;627.481(c)
should be State level audit resolution. However, this paragraph also applies to resolution beyond the State level
(e.g., the resolution of a service provider audit by an SDA). A third commenter suggested that the regulation at &sect;627.481(c)
should mandate that audit work papers be accessible to the auditee. Since these audits are procured by the auditee,
it is within their purview, and not the Department's, to include requirements concerning work papers in their agreement
with the auditors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Closeout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that waiting 3 years (the full period during which funds are available for expenditure) to
close out a grant that can be closed in 1 to 11/2 years is confusing and unnecessary. It was also stated that this provision
should allow closeout to occur as soon as all of the funds are expended or within 90 days after the end of the funding period.
A second commenter suggested that the word ``timely'' is a subjective term and that the provision should require closeout
to occur within 90 days after the end of the funding period, unless the deadline is extended. This same commenter indicated
that the regulation should be clear that closeouts are based on year of appropriation. Several of the comments indicated
an apparent misunderstanding that &sect;627.485 applies to subrecipient awards. In fact, this provision is intended
to inform the direct recipients of the Department's intention to close out each annual grant agreement within a short
period after the availability of the funds has lapsed. The Department has determined that it is much more appropriate
and less confusing to close out all of the annual JTPA grant agreements (described at &sect;627.405 as the funding
document for an individual program year's funds) at the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the language in the last sentence of paragraph (b) should allow for additional revisions,
as long as there is a good reason that is adequately documented; further, the commenter suggested such revisions could
be handled through an increase or decrease in the ``carryover'' amount. The first sentence of the paragraph allows
for a 90-day period within which revisions may be made without a requirement for justification. The second sentence
allows the Grant Officer to extend the period for revisions if the recipient requests an extension and provides a justification
for same. The Department sees no need for any change to this provision. Also, at the end of the three-year funding period,
there are no ``carryover'' funds, only funds for which the three-year availability has lapsed. These funds must be
returned in accordance with paragraph (c) if they have been drawn down, and will be deobligated by ETA.

Later Disallowances and Adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the final rule should identify the period within which the Grant Officer has the authority
to disallow costs. Such an action is not necessary. If an audit or review is conducted while the records are still available
in accordance with the requirements of &sect;627.460 (i.e., 3 years after submittal of the final expenditure report
for the funding period) and there are unallowable costs, then the Grant Officer can disallow those costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Amounts Due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that this provision must acknowledge that there are processes at the local level which impede
collection of disallowed costs and which prohibit collection efforts by the Federal Government (or State) during
the time when the State (or local) collection actions are in process. Other sections of these regulations (e.g., &sect;627.485)
contain provisions which allow recipients to request additional time to complete such a process. However, once a
Federal debt is established against a recipient, it is that direct recipient which the Department holds liable. The
provision is not changed.

Grievances and Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule revised, redesignated, and reordered the regulatory provisions formerly found at 20 CFR part
29, Subpart D_``Grievances, Investigations, and Hearings'' in a new part 627, subparts E, F, G, and H. The interim
final regulations more clearly defined the various JTPA grievance procedures required to be established by section
144 of the Act. The procedures applicable to a particular grievance process level were consolidated into discrete
subparts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart E_Grievance Procedures at the State and Local Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new part 627, subpart E, sets forth the grievance procedures required at the State and SDA and SSG levels, including
State review, that were generally found at 20 CFR 629.52. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the reference to the handling of complaints alleging discrimination in &sect;627.500(a)
be made a separate paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with the suggestion and &sect;627.500 is revised to redesignate the last sentence in paragraph
(a) as a new paragraph (b), Handling of discrimination complaints. In addition, paragraphs (b) and (c) are redesignated
as paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter observed that under the previous regulations, complaints involving fraud, waste, abuse, or criminal
activity were to be reported to the Secretary, and that &sect;627.500(b) of the interim final regulations now provides
that such complaints are to be reported to the DOL OIG. The commenter's concern was that ETA might not be aware of, but
had a need to know of, such complaints, and recommended that the regulations be amended to also include notification
to ETA for such complaints. Another commenter suggested that complaints be reported concurrently to ETA and the OIG.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the interim final regulations was to ensure that criminal activity was directed to the OIG for resolution.
Other processes set forth in the regulations for the handling of complaints are designed for non-criminal JTPA complaints.
The provision at &sect;627.500(b) is amended to provide for reporting criminal activity to the OIG, Office of Investigations
through the Department's Incident Reporting System, with a copy simultaneously provided to ETA. Other non-criminal
complaints will continue to be handled under the procedures set forth at part 627, subparts E and F, and through the
Department's Incident Reporting System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended deleting &sect;627.500(c)(2) concerning a private right of action with respect to alleged
violations of JTPA statute or regulations in pursuing non-JTPA remedies since there is no statutory authority for
the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision at &sect;627.500(c)(2) is not a new provision. Prior to the interim final rule, it was set forth at 20
CFR 629.51(b)(3) since the March 15, 1983 regulations implementing JTPA. It does not preclude a private right of action
if one exists, but rather indicates that nothing in the Act or in the regulations creates such a right. No change is made
to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that States, SDA's, and SSG's be required to develop their grievance procedures in such a
way as to broadly inform participants under the JTPA system of their rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the Act and regulations clearly set out the broad outlines of the grievance, hearings,
and appeal rights under JTPA for interested parties. The specific complaint and grievance procedures to be followed
are appropriately developed at the State and local level in accordance with the provisions of the Act and these regulations.
Such procedures are routinely made available to participants upon entering the program, and to subrecipients and
other interested parties. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that States should be required to establish timeframes for resolving complaints and recommended
a 60-day time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects that State, SDA and SSG grievance procedures already address this issue as an integral and
necessary part of their procedures. In any case, the regulations already include a 60-day time period at &sect;&sect;627.502(c)
and 627.503 (a) and (c) of the interim final rule. Therefore, no change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that a neutral third party be included in the grievance processes at the State level under
&sect;627.501, and the SDA and SSG level under &sect;627.502, to hear and act upon complaints. In addition, the commenter
suggested that programs should be encouraged to take advantage of recent Federal initiatives related to mediation
of disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final regulations already provide for the use of neutrals in the JTPA grievance process in certain situations.
For instance, such use is included in binding arbitration proceedings under the alternate procedure for handling
labor standards violation under section 144 of the Act, and the alternative dispute resolution provisions at &sect;627.805
available to parties to a complaint under &sect;627.801, Procedures for filing a request for hearing. The regulations
also provide for an independent review of complaints at the State level pursuant to the provisions at &sect;627.503.
No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended increased DOL participation in monitoring and handling complaint processes at the State
and SDA and SSG levels, including regular participation in grievance hearings.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grievance procedures established pursuant to section 144 of the Act, and set forth at &sect;&sect;627.501 and
627.502 of the interim final rule, are intended to ensure due process and to provide for the timely and orderly processing
of JTPA complaints at the State and local levels. The regulations also provide for a State-level review of local grievances,
as set forth at &sect;627.503. There is also provision for Federal-level review of State and local-level complaints
without decision at &sect;&sect;627.601(a) and 627.605. It would be premature and improper to interject the Department
into a State or local grievance process before it is completed. It would also create problems in the event that the Department
was subsequently requested to review a complaint in which it had participated. The Department believes that the regulations
set forth in the interim final rule are appropriate and consistent with the legislative provisions. Therefore, no
change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that the time period for requesting a State-level review of a local complaint, provided under
&sect;627.503(c) of the interim final rule, be increased from 10 and 15 days to 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statutory provisions at section 144, and the regulatory provisions at part 627, subparts E, F, G and H, the
grievance procedures established at the various levels are intended to provide the speedy processing of filed complaints.
The Department believes that the timeframes established in the regulations are consistent with the statutory scheme.
No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended including examples of independent reviewers at &sect;627.503(b) pertaining to State level
review of complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not believe that it is appropriate to include a laundry list of examples of possible independent
reviewers in the regulations, but agrees that some clarification in this area is warranted. Section 627.503(b) is
amended in the final rule to indicate that independent review should be conducted by a reviewer who is not connected
with the JTPA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended amending the employer-level grievance provisions at &sect;627.504 to indicate that if
an employer is required to use grievance procedures under a covered collective bargaining agreement, then those
should be the operative procedures for the handling of JTPA complaints at that level. In addition, it was recommended
that if no collective bargaining agreement exists, participants should be made fully aware of their rights to file
a grievance either by using the employer's grievance procedures or the SDA's JTPA grievance procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that where the employer is required to follow a certain grievance procedure under the provisions
of a collective bargaining agreement, those procedures should be followed for complaints pertaining to the terms
and conditions of employment of JTPA participants, therefore, &sect;627.504(b) is revised accordingly. The regulations
provide that recipients, SDA's and SSG's shall ensure that employers have grievance procedures available to their
JTPA participants. Some commenters suggested that participants be permitted to choose a grievance procedure under
which to process a complaint. The regulations indicate that employers of JTPA participants may elect to operate their
own grievance procedures or use the recipient's, SDA's or SSG's grievance procedures established pursuant to section
144 of the Act. The employer must inform participants of the procedures they are to follow when they begin employment.
The choice of which grievance procedure to follow does not extend to the individual participants. Since the relationship
exists between the employer and the JTPA entity in the first instance, it is important that all of the procedures and
provisions applicable to a given employer, including grievance procedures, are clearly established in the agreement.
The Department believes that the existing regulatory provision is consistent with the provisions of the Act, avoids
potential confusion that could result from the recommended change, and provides for the consistent treatment and
processing of JTPA complaints at the employer level. No change is made to the final rule.

Subpart F_Federal Handling of Non-criminal Complaints and Other Allegations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommended that the reference to the handling of discrimination complaints at 20 CFR 627.600 be made
a separate paragraph. The Department agrees with this recommendation and is amending the final regulations to redesignate
the first two sentences of &sect;627.600 as paragraph (a), and the last sentence, pertaining to discrimination complaints,
as paragraph (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended revising &sect;627.601, noting that section authorizes the receipt of complaints at the
Federal level without mention of the statutory preconditions for such acceptance that are partially explained in
paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(5) of that section. Further, the commenter argued that although some of the preconditions
for acceptance of a complaint at the Federal level appear in later sections of the regulations, &sect;627.601, as
written, is unauthorized by the Act and is misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions at &sect;627.601 are not intended, by themselves, to spell out all of the preconditions that apply
to the various complaints and allegations that may be filed at the Federal level, but rather are intended to indicate
the types of such complaints that may be received and the options available to the Secretary for the handling of such
complaints. The provisions that apply to the Federal handling of non-criminal complaints and other allegations
are set out in all of subpart F and must be viewed in their entirety to determine how they apply. The various sections
in subpart F either include the preconditions for filing a complaint or cite other provisions of the Act and/or JTPA
regulations which spell out such preconditions. The Department believes that the regulatory provisions are consistent
with, and accurately reflect, the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that, under the provision at &sect;627.601, the Governor does not have final determination
authority in any complaint because the regulations specify that Federal level reviews may include all of paragraph
(a), which includes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
violation of the Act, and recommended that the final rule provide clarification in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations, at &sect;627.503(d), provide that, with the exception of complaints alleging violations of the
labor standards at section 143 of the Act, the Governor's decision is final unless the Secretary exercises the authority
for Federal-level review set forth at &sect;627.601 of the interim final regulations. The provisions at &sect;627.601(a)
reserve the Secretary's authority to receive and review complaints alleging a specific violation of the Act and/or
JTPA regulations, notwithstanding resolution of a complaint under procedures at a lower level. Upon receipt, the
Secretary may handle such complaints, as set forth at paragraph (b) of that section. The Department believes that
the regulations accurately reflect the Secretary's and Governor's authority in this area and that further clarification
in the regulations is not needed. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that, in the remedies available for labor standards violations, &sect;627.603(c)(3) refers to
``back pay,'' and paragraph (d)(2) of that section refers to ``lost wages'' and asked for a definition of these terms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final regulations incorporated the statutory language pertaining to remedies for labor standards violations
at section 143(f) of the Act, which includes these two terms. The Department believes that, from a practical standpoint,
there is no difference in these two terms. Both terms refer generically to ``compensation'' in the context of appropriate
remedies; under paragraph (c)(3), wages are not an available remedy, while they are an available remedy under paragraph
(d)(2). In applying a remedy, these terms would refer to the amount of compensation (excluding benefits which are
separately provided for) that a person would have received had the violation not occurred. The Department believes
that the regulations are sufficiently clear and that further clarification is not needed. No change is made to the
final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter disagreed with the provision at &sect;627.603(b)(4) which provides that there is no ALJ review of the
Secretary's decision upholding the Governor's decision in complaints alleging section 143 labor standard violations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act, at section 144(d)(2), specifically provides that the Secretary may modify or reverse the Governor's decision
on a complaint alleging a labor standards violation, or issue a decision if no decision has been issued, only after
an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge of the Department of Labor. The opportunity for an
ALJ hearing is limited to actions by the Secretary to change a Governor's decision or to issue a decision as provided
for at section 144(d)(2) of the Act. The provisions at section 144(d)(3), pertaining to the Secretary upholding the
Governor's decision, specifically state that the Secretary's decision ``shall become the final decision of the
Secretary.'' The Department believes that the regulations accurately reflect, and implement, the provisions at
section 144(d) of the Act. No change is made to the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received on &sect;627.604 and no change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that under the provisions at &sect;627.605, Special Federal review of SDA and SSG-level
complaints without decision, where there has been no action on a complaint at the local level the Department should
not only act on the individual complaint, but also conduct a thorough review of the administrative capabilities of
the SDA/SSG. In addition, the Secretary should be prepared to impose more than just a sanction for failing to issue
a complaint decision, but also impose corrective actions up to and including reorganization of the SDA/SSG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision at &sect;627.605 pertains to actions that may be taken against the Governor for failing to provide a
decision as required at &sect;627.503(a) of the regulations. These actions may include imposing a sanction for failing
to issue a decision pursuant to the provisions at &sect;627.605(b). The right of the Secretary to review SDA/SSG operations
for compliance with the Act and applicable JTPA regulations is reserved at &sect;627.601(b) of the regulations.
The Department believes that the regulations provide adequate and appropriate procedures for the handling of complaints
alleging violations of the Act and JTPA regulations at the Federal, State, and SDA/SSG levels, consistent with implementing
the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter indicated that there were two paragraphs (d) in &sect;627.606. The second is now redesignated as paragraph
(e). Another commented that the correct reference in &sect;627.606(d)(2)(vii) should be subpart H. The final rule
is corrected. Also, the heading of &sect;627.606(c) is changed to read, ``

Subpart G_Sanctions for Violations of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liability of Units of Local Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters objected to the Department's singling out units of local government for bearing liability for funds
misexpended by their SDA/SSG. It is not the Department's intent to single out units of local government to bear liability,
but it is the Department's intent to make clear that neither a separately incorporated administrative entity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a PIC) nor a local unit of government can insulate (liability-proof) itself from responsibility for misexpended
funds. This is a more clearly expressed statement of the Department's position, and does not constitute a change in
policy or position. One commenter expressed full support for the provision while another thought it should be made
even stronger by requiring local government units to be held liable. The provision is not changed. The Department
encourages incorporated PIC's to be active participants in the delivery of JTPA services. To this end, the provisions
of &sect;628.415(b) indicate that the Governor's requirements on responsibility for JTPA funds may not, on their
face, preclude the selection of an incorporated PIC as the grant recipient.

Waiver of State Liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of a comment concerning &sect;627.480(f), discussed above, the second sentence of &sect;627.704(a)
is removed. It is replaced with two new paragraphs, (b)(1) and (b)(2), which address the timing of requests for waiver
of State liability. The remaining two paragraphs are redesignated as paragraphs (c) and (d), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested that SDA's should be allowed to request waivers. Some indicated that such requests should
be made in conjunction with States, while others seemed to imply that such requests could be made directly, bypassing
the State. However, as indicated at &sect;627.702(e), it is the recipient that is held liable by ETA. Therefore, the
only liability that ETA can waive is the recipient's liability for the sanction imposed on it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the provision should be revised to permit a waiver in those instances where the
fraud was perpetrated against the recipient/subrecipient so as to avoid penalizing entities which discover, report,
investigate and prosecute the perpetrator of such fraud. Both this provision at &sect;627.704 and the provision
at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.706 Process for advance approval of a recipient's contemplated corrective actions are revised for such
situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Offset Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters expressed the belief that States would not request ``offset'' if it were limited to State-level administrative
funding. A commenter also indicated that most misexpenditures occur at the subrecipient level and that, if it is not
a section 164(e)(1) violation, offset should be allowed at the level where the misexpenditure occurred. Another
suggested the need to be flexible after considering all of the circumstances in the individual case. Section 164(d)
of the Act indicates that offset may be ``against any other amounts to which the recipient is or may be entitled *&blank;*&blank;*.''
(Emphasis added) Under title II, the recipient must allocate 77 percent of the funds to SDA's and is entitled to retain
23 percent of the funds allotted for specifically identified activities. It is the Department's position that a reduction
in the funds available through the ``offset'' process should not adversely impact the delivery of training and services
to participants, nor the incentive grant and capacity building activities. Therefore, the Department believes
that only the title II five percent (5 percent) administrative funds to which the recipient is entitled should be available
for offset. Similar reasoning applies to the Department's restriction for title III funds. The Department fully
expects that recipients will seriously consider their options, and the consequences thereof, and will not make frivolous
use of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter indicated that use of the phrase, ``amounts chargeable'', in &sect;627.708(b), conveys the implication
that the administrative costs must be incurred before they can be ``offset''. This was not the Department's intent.
The provision is rewritten to indicate that ``offset'' may be against amounts allotted that are expected to be used
for recipient-level administrative costs.

Subpart H_Hearings by the Office of Administrative Law Judges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommended amending the regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;627.800(a) to include Grant Officer Final Determinations made pursuant to &sect;627.606 under the ALJ hearing
process in addition to those specified at section 166(a) arising in connection with alleged violations of sections
141(c), 144 (d) and (e), 164(f) and 167 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 166(a) of the Act provides that an ALJ hearing may be requested by any recipient upon whom a corrective action
or sanction has been imposed by the Secretary. By definition this would include final determinations made by the Grant
Officer. The Department believes that the general provision included in section 166(a) of the Act is sufficiently
clear in establishing the jurisdiction of the ALJ and that further clarification is not needed. No change is made to
the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter objected to the restrictions placed on the jurisdiction of the OALJ regarding specific sections of the
law which the commenter believes will reduce the opportunity for complainants to have full redress of their grievances
at the highest levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OALJ coverage is as provided for at section 166 of the Act, and set forth at &sect;627.800 of the interim final regulations.
As noted in the response to the preceding comment, the OALJ's jurisdiction includes more than just the specific sections
cited at section 166(a) of the Act. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter raised some concerns regarding the entities specified at &sect;627.801(a) that may request an ALJ hearing
based on a Grant Officer's final determination which imposes a sanction, a corrective action, or denies financial
assistance. It was correctly suggested that the Grant Officer might issue a sanction upon a ``vendor'' and paragraph
(a) is amended to cover such situations. A commenter recommended that the provisions at &sect;627.801(a) pertaining
to procedures for filing a request for an ALJ hearing could be made clear that a request for a hearing must be submitted
by certified mail, by changing the words ``may transmit by certified mail'' to ``must transmit by certified mail.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the provision at &sect;627.801(a) of the interim final regulations seems to indicate
that the use of certified mail to transmit a request for a ALJ hearing is discretionary, which was not intended. The
provision at &sect;627.801(a) is amended to indicate that the Grant Officer's final determination to impose a sanction
or corrective action, or to deny financial assistance 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be appealed to the OALJ within 21 days of receipt of the final determination, and that a request for a hearing shall be
transmitted by certified mail, return receipt requested to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has reviewed &sect;627.802(e) in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
114 S.Ct. 2251, 62 U.S.L.W. 4543 (June 20, 1994) which addresses the allocation of burden of proof in cases governed
by &sect;7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act and has concluded that no change in this section is required. In
Greenwich Collieries, the Supreme Court concluded that a claimant for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act
was the ``proponent of a rule or order'' under section 7(c) of the APA and, as such, carried the burden of persuasion.
Section 627.802(e) of these regulations is predicated on the fact that in appeals from Grant Officer Final Determinations
the grantee is the proponent of the rule since, in the absence of an appeal, the Final Determination would represent
a final debt due and owing the United States. The grantee seeking to avoid this outcome is clearly the ``proponent of
the rule or order.'' This construction is also consistent with section 165 of the Act which places on grantees the affirmative
obligation to maintain adequate documentation to prove the allowability of costs incurred. While the grantee has
the burden of persuasion, in our desire to ensure orderly presentation of evidence, the Grant Officer retains the
obligation to prepare and present the administrative file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a few of the commenters noted typographical errors or incorrect statutory and/or regulatory citations
in part 627, subparts E, F, G, and H which are corrected in the final rule.

Subpart I_Transition and Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 3, 1993, the interim final rule was amended to revise the transition provisions at part 627, subpart I (58 FR
31471). Those requirements are restated in the final rule, along with the addition of a definition of ``initiation
of procurement'' (&sect;627.904(e)) and a provision for the transfer of summer program funds (&sect;627.904(k)(2)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of general comments were received on the difficulties and uncertainties of the transition to the new program
to be implemented on July 1, 1993 and whether the contents of the interim final rule adequately addressed a range of
questions on the transition. Subsequent to the publication of the interim final rule on December 29, 1992, the Department
conducted implementation training for the States in February and March of 1992, provided transition guidance in
Training and Employment Guidance Letter 7&hyph;92 on March 8, 1993, and issued two sets of questions and answers on
the transition and interim final rule to the Department of Labor regional offices by Field Memorandum that were widely
circulated throughout the JTPA system. The Department believes that these mechanisms with the additional guidance
reflected in the June 3, 1993

Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;235) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nontraditional Employment for Women (NEW) Act includes a series of amendments to the JTPA. NEW's purposes are
to provide a wider range of training opportunities for women under existing JTPA programs; to provide incentives
for the establishment of programs that train, place, and retain women in nontraditional fields; and to facilitate
coordination of JTPA and vocational education resources available for training and placing women in nontraditional
employment. Further, the NEW Act is consistent with the overall goal of JTPA programs to increase participants' employment,
earnings, educational and occupational skills. This separate discussion of the NEW Act is provided as a reminder
to States and SDAs of the importance of efforts to train and place women in nontraditional employment and the emphasis
the Department places on such efforts. There are contained in the final rule various references to the requirements
pertaining to nontraditional employment for women, especially as they pertain to planning and setting goals, the
assessment process and development of the individual service strategy, and to the various reports required by the
Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Nontraditional employment'' is defined in the NEW Act as occupations or fields of work where women comprise less
than 25 percent of the individuals employed in such occupation or field of work. Although nontraditional occupations
are usually thought of only as construction or skilled trades, these occupations encompass a much broader spectrum
of jobs, including those in technical and other fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontraditional occupations have the potential for greatly improving the economic status of women, particularly
when they are growth occupations with increased wage potential. Nontraditional training for women also provides
benefits for the States and the SDA's. The Department believes that this kind of training expands the occupational
mix available to all customers, and can enhance coordination with other education and training programs, as well
as with labor and apprenticeship programs. It helps advance efforts by the States and/or SDA's to be a valuable source
of trained individuals for employers and unions. Through the implementation of NEW, it is the Department's intent
that changes will occur throughout the job training system so that training in nontraditional occupations becomes
institutionalized in each State. The GCSSP and the job training plan prepared by each SDA were required to include
goals, actions, and accomplishments for the training and placement of women in nontraditional employment for the
2-year period beginning July 1, 1992 and beyond. NEW does not establish specific numerical goals by SDA or State. However,
using General Accounting Office data (GAS/HRD&hyph;89&hyph;152FS, September 1989), the Department estimates
that the proportion of women currently trained by JTPA in nontraditional occupations nationwide is about 9 percent.
Therefore, at their option, States and SDA's may use this figure as a substitute for a particular State's baseline
until they can collect data specific to that State. States should strive for a goal for training and placing more than
9 percent of women participants in nontraditional occupations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects that the GCSSP and the SDA's job training plan will reflect specific measurable activities
to train and to place women in nontraditional employment and apprenticeships, as required by the statute. As mentioned
earlier, SDA's may wish to consider using the national figure of 9 percent as an indication of the pre-NEW level of nontraditional
training until geographic-specific data becomes available. Sections 104(b)(6) and (13), 121(b)(3) and 122(b)(5)&hyph;(7)
of the Act require the States and SDA's to set goals and report on program accomplishments. The Department intends
to look closely at these activities to ensure compliance with requirements of NEW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department expects that each State's and SDA's plans and activities will reflect the development of
outreach and promotional materials and/or activities aimed at making women aware of the programs and the services
available through JTPA, particularly of nontraditional training and placement opportunities. Examples of outreach
materials include, but are not limited to, nontraditional career information modules, video and print materials
on nontraditional career options (for counselors), recruitment brochures targeted at both the customer and the
employer, and dissemination of preexisting resource materials and/or model curricula. States may also wish to undertake
statewide public education campaigns, similar to those conducted for literacy programs, on nontraditional training
and employment opportunities. The Department expects statewide dissemination of model programs/approaches to
serve as a method of encouraging the replication and institutionalization of nontraditional training in the State.
The Department encourages the States to disseminate to SDA's and service providers the SJTCC's summary report on
promising programs funded by JTPA or the Carl Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comments that pertained to NEW sought to add to the regulations a number of specific requirements regarding
services to women and focussed on nontraditional employment. These suggested requirements ranged from language
to requiring OJT goals for women in nontraditional employment, as well as standards for OJT contracts, to specific
procurement requirements as they pertain to women-owned businesses, and specific monitoring requirements. The
Department believes that many of these ideas have merit but does not believe that it is appropriate to establish them
as Federal regulatory requirements beyond that which would otherwise be required by the provisions of the Act_particularly
as the Federal Government looks to reduce administrative requirements. On the other hand, a commenter suggested
that the regulations ought to reflect the statutory requirements. The Department is persuaded that the NEW's requirements
should be emphasized by referencing them, as appropriate, in the regulations and has done so in appropriate sections,
including: &sect;627.455, for the annual report to the Governor that is to be described in the job training plan; &sect;628.205,
pertaining to the State goals for the training and training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment
and apprenticeships; &sect;628.210, for the responsibility of the SJTCC to review and analyze the annual reports
of SDA's and to distribute them in the State and to the Secretary; and &sect;628.420, for the SDA's local goals for the
training and training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment. These are not new regulatory requirements;
rather they are reflections of statutory requirements.

Several comments were received on the Governor's coordination and special services plans. Section 628.205(c) of
the interim final regulations required the States to provide their respective SDA's prior to December 31 of the year
preceding the program years for which the plan is developed, information on its plans to undertake State activities
in program areas, including education coordination and services to older workers, and capacity building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested removal of the December 31 date. The commenters suggested the language be revised to
say that the State should issue this information to SDA's in sufficient time for them to be able to take it into consideration
in developing plans. The Department agrees with the commenters and this change is made to the final regulations in
a new paragraph (c)(2).

that this would be a good step. However, since JOBS representatives can be included within the meaning of ``representatives

Several commenters were concerned that the regulations did not require, or at least encourage, that membership on
the SJTCC or the HRIC include the State Agency on Aging or a designee to ensure that the needs of older workers are addressed.
It was stressed that such representation on these councils would improve the commitment to older workers and promote
the development of integrated service systems for older workers. The Department agrees that the needs of older individuals
should be addressed in the provision of JTPA services; however, in interpreting requirements of the Act at sections
122(a)(3)(B)(i)(SJTCC) and 702(b)(5)(HRIC), the Department believes there is already sufficient latitude and
flexibility for the Governor to appoint a representative from the State Agency on Aging and further regulation is
not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that it would be helpful to clarify in paragraph (a) of the regulation that, when the State Council
on Vocational Education (SCOVE) is incorporated in the HRIC, the HRIC is responsible for carrying out the functions
of the SCOVE. The Department believes that this is clear in the provisions of the Act and in &sect;628.215(e) of the
regulations. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that, when the SCOVE is included within the HRIC, it would be beneficial to include the State
Director of vocational education on the HRIC since the State Director plays an important role in education within
each State, especially in coordination and improvement of educational services. The Department agrees and the final
rule at &sect;628.215(c) encourages the Governor to consider appointment of the State Director to the HRIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned the accounting basis for funds that are made available to the HRIC. Some wished to ensure
that when funds are made available to the council the statutory activities for which they are intended are accomplished.
Another commenter pointed out that the requirement to allocate funds on the basis of ``benefits received'' goes beyond
the requirements of the Act and the Conference Report, which simply specified that State agencies were encouraged
to provide funds in a manner consistent with their representation on the council and that no agency's contribution
be disproportionate. The Department has examined this issue and believes that the Act contemplates some flexibility
in terms of how the costs of the activities of the Council relate to the various applicable programs. This is particularly
true under circumstances in which there is a reasonable contribution on behalf of an applicable program. The Department
has determined that, as specified in the Conference Report, the costs of the Council may be allocated upon the basis
of the relationship of each funding source to the total funding of all applicable sources or programs that are represented
on the Council. Finally, on the condition that there is a reasonable contribution from other involved Federal and
State programs, the various activities of the council fall within the overall coordination mandates of the Act and
the related costs are allowable JTPA costs to the extent that JTPA funds are available from applicable JTPA sources.
The final rule is revised accordingly in paragraph (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify the requirement of paragraph (g) regarding the certification of the HRIC by the Governor, the final
rule is changed to indicate that the certification is to be in writing with a copy provided to the Secretary of Education.

A number of comments were received on State education coordination and grants found at &sect;628.315 of the interim
final regulations. In addition to the specific areas discussed below, the comments suggested confusion about the
administrative framework for the development of the section 123 program and the need for a general description of
the program. The section 123 program is to be a partnership between the JTPA program and the education system in the
State. The Act provides a strong role for the State education agency by requiring that funds be allocated to the agency,
and that the agency have a central role in planning and in the operation of the program. In order to foster coordination
at the State level, the Act requires that the Governor and the State education agency agree on the use of funds as part
of the joint development of the education part of the GCSSP. If there is no agreement, the regulations provide that
neither party may use the funds. To foster coordination at the local level, the Act requires the State education agency
to enter into agreements with the JTPA SDA administrative entities. If there is no agreement with the administrative
entity, the Act indicates that the amount of funds specified for the SDA in the State-level agreement may be unilaterally
used by the Governor for meeting the goals of section 123(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised concerns regarding the definition of State education agency. The commenters requested
that the final regulations specify that the Governor may allocate the 8 percent funds only to the State Education Agency,
as defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Department believes that clarification is needed.
The commenters argued that the definition of ``state educational agency'' in section 4(23) of the Act specifically
refers to the agency defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as the state education agency for JTPA purposes.
The Department interprets the Act differently. The term ``state educational agency'' is a different term from the
term ``state education agency,'' which is used in section 123(a) of the Act. The term defined in section 4 of the Act
is used in section 122(a)(3)(B)(1) of the Act to describe membership on the SJTCC. Support for the view that the terms
used in sections 4 and 123 of the Act are intended to be different is found in the use of the phrase ``any State education
agency'' in section 123(a). If the Department were to read this phrase to mean a single agency, the reading would render
the word ``any'' redundant. The Department reads section 123(a) to mean that, at a minimum, the Governor may consider
as the State education agency that agency responsible for primary and secondary education, or responsible for vocational
education programs under the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act and the Adult Education
Act. In addition, the Department finds that a number of States have consolidated a number of education functions and
agencies into various cabinet arrangements. For this reason, the Department has determined that the regulations
should retain the statutory language ``any education agency,'' but some changes are made in &sect;628.315(a) of
the final rule. The phrase ``or agencies'' is removed from the final rule because the Department does not intend to
cause confusion or appear to encourage the designation of multiple agencies; however, the rule should not be read
to absolutely prohibit this practice under justifiable circumstances when significant parts of the education function
are not within one agency. As previously reflected in the interim final rule, the Governor is not permitted to designate
any agency for which ``education'' is not the primary and operational function, which means that the entity must actually
be responsible for the operation of educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter questioned the conditions under which the State JTPA entity can be found eligible to be a subrecipient
of the 8-percent monies. The Act envisions the state education agency as receiving and using the section 123 funds.
The State JTPA entity is only eligible to be a subrecipient if the agreement with the Governor and State education agency
stipulates this as a part of the agreement. In response to the question of whether a portion of the funds may be used for

A commenter raised a concern regarding the time limit for negotiation between the Governor and the State education
agency when negotiating the joint agreement in accordance with the provisions found at &sect;628.315(b) of the interim
final regulations. While there is no specific time limit, the Department expects that the agreement would be in place
in time to allow for the expenditure of funds allotted for the designated program period. No change is made to the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether the State JTPA entity or the State education agency was responsible for the development
of the plan for the use of funds. The Department believes that the State education agency has the primary role in development
of the plan, but that the plan is to be developed jointly or in consultation. In practice, most arrangements for development
of the plan which are satisfactory to the parties will be accepted by the Department, so long as there is joint agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised concerns about the provision of the interim final rule that stipulates that when the Governor
and the State education agency fail to agree to develop a joint plan for use of the Education Coordination and Grants
funds ``the Governor shall not allocate funds under section 123(a)(1) to such education agency, nor shall such funds
be available for expenditure by the Governor''. The purpose of the rule is to indicate that neither party should benefit
from a failure to agree on the use of education coordination funds. The Department believes that this position is consistent
with the provisions of the Act that call for joint agreement between the Governor and the State education agency and,
therefore, no change is made to this section of the regulations. The Department wishes to clarify that this agreement
between the Governor and the State education agency is not the same as specified in section 123(e) between the State
education agency and the SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested that the barriers discussed in &sect;628.315(d) be defined. The barriers discussed in this
section are the same barriers that are specified under title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C of the Act or any additional barriers
the Governor may specify. No changes are made to this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter pointed out that &sect;628.315(d)(1)(i) of the interim final rule did not contain a citation to the provision
of title II&hyph;C authorizing funds for section 123 programs. The Department agrees and the final rule contains
that citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters inquired whether youth who are in compensatory education programs under chapter I of title I of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, who are found to meet the eligibility requirements for free lunch
under the National School Lunch Act, or who are in school-wide projects would fall within the meaning of economically
disadvantaged to satisfy the requirement to serve the disadvantaged. The Department believes that they do, and has
drafted the regulations to reflect the applicability of the eligibility criteria from one section or part of the Act
to other parts wherever practicable. So, for example, the final rule is revised, in &sect;628.315(d)(1)(ii), to
indicate that the criteria discussed above apply to the education coordination grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether &sect;628.315(d)(1)(iii) should refer directly to the non-economically disadvantaged.
Additionally, the commenters expressed concern that priority for these funds should be given to in-school projects
as opposed to Title III eligible participants. The interim final rule referenced non-economically disadvantaged.
The final rule is revised to reflect the statutory language, although the meaning is not changed. No change is made
to the regulations regarding the priority for Title III eligible participants since that priority is statutory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that the regulations should allow for direct allocation of State education coordination
and grants funds to the SDA. No change is made in the regulations since the Act is specific as it relates to the Governor
allocating funds to the State education agency and the State education agency being the entity that determines how
and where the funds will be distributed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned with the State matching requirements which changed the requirement from an 80
percent to a 100 percent match for Federal funds received for the State education coordination grants. These comments
do not appear to have recognized the change in statutory language wrought by the amendments. Prior to the amendments,
section 123(c) of the Act required only that matching funds be provided for three of the four kinds of projects specified
in section 123(a). The amended law, in section 123(a)(3), requires matching funds for all the kinds of projects specified.
Thus, while the matching requirement originally applied only to the kinds of projects to which 80 percent of the funds
available under section 123 were allotted, the law has been changed so that all funds are required to be matched. Similarly,
the language in section 123 describing the ``20%'' projects has been changed. The original language was that Federal
funds could be used to pay the cost of ``20%'' projects based on JTPA section 123(c)(2)(A). The new language is that
Federal funds may be used to pay the Federal share of ``20%'' projects based on JTPA section 123(d)(2)(A). The final
rule is revised to clarify that the matching requirement for the State is for an amount equal to the total of section
123 funds. Further, the rule clarifies that if there is no agreement between the State education agency and the administrative
entity in the SDA, the matching requirement does not apply.

Services to Older Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State set-aside program for older workers was incorporated into section 204(d) of the Act. Requirements for the
older workers program are set forth in &sect;628.320 of the interim final rule. The Governor continues to be responsible
for carrying out these programs pursuant to agreements with public agencies, PIC's, SDA's, non-profits or private
businesses. The Amendments require that, in entering into these agreements, the Governor is to give priority to organizations
which have a record of demonstrated effectiveness in serving older individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the final rule, the Older Americans Act was amended by Public Law 103&hyph;171 to revise
the eligibility criteria as they pertain to older workers served in JTPA programs. It provides, as had been the case
for the regular title II program (and as is reflected at &sect;628.605(e) of this rule), that older individuals participating
in joint programs with sponsors under title V of the Older Americans Act who are eligible under title V are deemed to
satisfy the requirements of section 203(a) of the Act. A new paragraph (d)(2) is added to &sect;628.320 to reflect
this amendment. It is important to recognize that a purpose of the Older Americans Act Amendments is to enable Senior
Community Service Employment Program participants who are in joint programs to participate in JTPA activities.
In response to questions concerning the nature of an agreement for a joint program between JTPA and the title V program
sponsor, the Department notes that, for purposes of both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;628.320(d)(2) and 628.605(e), the written agreement that sets forth the joint program should be structured
so that both the JTPA and the title V program provide services to participants consistent with the objective of the
participant and the resources of the participating program. For JTPA participants, services will be provided under
the ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned that the inclusion of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income in the
definition of ``family income'' severely limits the number of older individuals who are eligible for the program.
This issue is addressed under the definition of ``family income'' in &sect;626.5 of the final rule. The revised definition
clarifies the treatment of Social Security income and that Supplemental Security Income is not considered in the
calculation of family income. No change is made in this section of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters recommended the removal of limitations on job search assistance in &sect;628.535 as they might apply
to older workers. Job search assistance, including the application of the job search limitation restrictions as
they apply to older workers, is covered in the discussion of the job search limitations under &sect;628.535 elsewhere
in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters recommended that the Department define ``equitable basis'' as it relates to fund availability for
older worker services. The Department's view is that the definition of ``equitable basis'' will vary from State to
State based upon local circumstances and, therefore, the Governor should determine the basis upon which funds will
be distributed, taking into account the population of eligible older workers, their distribution throughout the
State, and the availability of resources for this population. However, in considering the question of whether funds
are distributed on an ``equitable basis'', the Department does not believe that all circumstances require that each
SDA or area within the State receive funds under this set-aside. Each State is to develop some reasonable measure,
including older individuals' share of the population or share of the labor force, in determining how these funds and
services will be provided throughout the State. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern that the performance standards for the older worker set-aside should be specifically
tailored to the unique needs of this population. As noted earlier in the discussion of the performance standards section,
the Department has convened a technical work group on the development of the new performance standards which includes
representatives of older workers, and will take these and other comments under consideration in developing performance
standards.

Capacity Building and Technical Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The JTPA has been amended to include capacity building and technical assistance as priorities at the national, State
and local levels for JTPA and other related human service programs. Section 453 of the Act calls for the creation of
a national Capacity Building and Information and Dissemination Network and a Replication Grant Program. State and
local priorities are established through sections 202(c)(2)(A) and 262(c)(2)(A) of the Act, which make available
up to 33 percent of the 5 percent incentive funds for capacity building and technical assistance activities. Section
121(a)(3) of the Act, requires that capacity building and technical assistance plans be included in the GCSSP. Greater
emphasis is placed on general technical assistance activities for the development and training of State, SDA, and
service provider staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments received on the interim final regulations supported the use of incentive funds for capacity
building and technical assistance activities and supported the need to develop the capacity of JTPA personnel at
all levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters requested that Private Industry Councils and other job training councils, as well as those who administer
JTPA, be included in capacity building activities. It was also requested that the inclusion of front-line staff be
made more evident. It is the Department's intent that capacity building and technical assistance activities be targeted
to all personnel who staff and administer JTPA at all level of the system. Section 628.325(c)(1) is revised to include
PIC's and other councils, as well as other related human service systems provided for in section 205(a) of the Act.
The word ``administer'' is added to the definition of capacity building at &sect;626.5, and ``front-line'' staff
are included in &sect;628.325(c)(2)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received requesting further clarification on the use of funds for the upgrade of Management Information
Systems (MIS). Section 628.325(c)(2)(iii) provides for the use of the 33 percent of the 5-percent incentive funds
authorized under the JTPA amendments for the purchase of hardware and/or software only if directly related to capacity
building and technical assistance activities of the National Capacity Building and Information Dissemination
Network (Network). These 5-percent funds may not be used exclusively for MIS; &sect;628.325(c)(2)(iii) sets forth
specific guidance on the purchase of hardware/ software. Funding for MIS redesign is addressed in Training and Employment
Information Notice 2&hyph;92, which provides for the use of PY 1992 6-percent incentive funds for MIS upgrading and
re-design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters continued to express concern that the non-duplication provision in section 202(c)(3)(B) of the
Act could seriously hamper State and local flexibility in developing products and delivering training. Section
628.325(c)(2)(iv) of the final regulations specifies that State and local capacity building efforts are to be coordinated
and integrated with the National Capacity Building Information Dissemination Network (Network), pursuant to sections
202(c)(3)(B) and 262(c)(3)(B) of the Act. In order to maximize funds available, the Network will build, to the extent
possible, on what already exists in the system. Through its clearinghouse, it will make information accessible to
the JTPA system on current and planned Network products so that duplication of effort may be avoided as States and SDA's
plan their capacity building agendas. Non-duplication should be viewed by the system as a means for maximizing scarce
resources and not as limiting the flexibility of States and SDA's to tailor Network products to their own needs and/or
to produce and train on similar or related products when local circumstances so dictate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the regulations mandate that the 33 percent of 5 percent incentive grant funds available
to the States for capacity building be passed to the SDA level for capacity building and technical assistance activities.
The final regulations continue to strongly encourage Governors to use these funds for the development of staff capabilities
at all levels, and particularly for front-line staff, through a comprehensive capacity building and technical assistance
strategy. While neither the Act nor the regulations require that funds be passed directly to the SDA's, the final regulations,
at &sect;628.325(c)(2)(ii), offer a variety of State options for ensuring coverage of SDA and front-line staff.
Section 628.205 encourages Governors to share capacity building plans in advance with SDA's and requires that capacity
building plans be included in the GCSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specific information was requested as to what related human service programs are covered under section 453 of
the Act. Section 628.325 (c)(1) and (d) includes those programs listed in section 205(a) of the Act among those human
service programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification on the allowable uses for incentive funds by SDA's, specifically asking
if there is any limit on the amount of incentive funds used for capacity building and if incentive funds can be used solely
for administration. One commenter suggested a maximum limit of 30% on the use of incentive funds for administration
in order to insure that their primary use focuses on training and capacity building. The Department intends to allow
the SDA's flexibility in determining how their incentive funds are best utilized. Section 627.440(c)(2) specifies
that incentive funds may be used without regard to cost limitations. However, a new paragraph (5) is added to &sect;628.325(b)
specifying that SDA's should use incentive funds for capacity building, technical assistance and services to eligible
participants. The former paragraphs (3) and (6) in &sect;628.325(b) which dealt with this topic are removed; the
remaining paragraphs are redesignated accordingly. Further clarification on SDA capacity building responsibilities
is also found in &sect;628.420, the Job Training Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SDA Designation Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final regulations, at &sect;628.405, clarified the SDA designation process. The language in the supplementary
information section indicated that SDA designations are to occur every 2 years, consistent with the preparation
of the 2-year GCSSP and the SDA job training plan. This information is incorrect and will be addressed in the context
of discussing the comments received in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also: established minimum criteria to be used by the Governor in considering discretionary SDA designation
requests under the provisions at section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act; provided clarification on the handling of competing
SDA designation requests under section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act; and defined the terms ``substantial portion'' and
``substantial part'' of a labor market area for the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii)
and (B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted that there was nothing at section 101 of the Act nor &sect;628.405(a) that indicates that SDA
designations are required to occur every two years, as indicated in the preamble of the interim final rule. The concerns
expressed in the comments were that to mandate that SDA's be designated every two years would be disruptive and would
serve to increase the number of SDA's rather than decrease them as intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters are correct that there is nothing in the Act nor the regulations that requires that SDA's be designated
by the Governor every two years. The preamble did not clearly convey the intent of the interim final regulations. The
intent of the preamble was to indicate that SDA designations, when they occurred, were to coincide with the 2-year
cycle for the GCSSP and the local job training plan. This was to clarify that SDA designations could not be made for an
off year of a 2-year period covered by the approved GCSSP and local job training plans. Section 628.405 is amended to
more clearly convey this requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter indicated that SDA designation, under &sect;628.405(a)(3) of the interim final rule, should not be required
for a previously designated SDA which has complied with all of the JTPA mandates and has successfully operated good
training programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is nothing in the Act or interim final regulations that requires existing SDA's to formally apply for designation
or redesignation by the Governor when such designations are to be made within the State. Section 628.405(a)(3) only
indicates that the Governor should address the treatment of existing SDA's in the procedures developed to govern
the SDA designation process within the State. Thus, the Governor may choose to require reapplication for each designation
cycle or to permit existing SDA's to continue without the need for a new application. Section 628.405(a)(2) of the
interim final regulations is redesignated, in part, as (a)(3), and is amended to clarify this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters took exception to the requirement that the Governor establish standards by which to evaluate discretionary
SDA designation requests under section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act which, at a minimum, must include the criteria set
forth at &sect;628.405(d). These requirements are viewed as overly prescriptive, limiting the Governor's discretion
in making SDA designations and establishing a higher standard than that provided for in the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that neither the provisions of the Act nor the interim final regulations, at &sect;628.405(d),
inhibit the Governor from making discretionary SDA designations, pursuant to section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act. The
Department does not believe that the regulatory provisions are overly prescriptive in establishing some uniform
minimum standards for the Governor to evaluate such designation requests. With approximately one-third of the over
640 current SDA's being discretionary designations, it is necessary to ensure the viability of such SDA's to adequately
administer and promote effective delivery of JTPA services to a substantial portion of the eligible population in
the area to be served. The regulations simply formalize the minimum standards that Governors would need to consider
and, in most instances, probably already have established, in making discretionary SDA designations consistent
with the provisions at section 101 of the Act. The Department believes that the regulations in this area are consistent
with the provisions at section 101 of the Act and the Secretary's authority to promulgate regulations to implement
the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters took exception to defining ``substantial part'' and ``substantial portion'' of a labor market
area (LMA) for the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii) and (B) of the Act, respectively.
These commenters argue that the requirement that the prospective SDA serve 10 percent of the population of an LMA is
arbitrary, artificial and exceeds the language in the Act, unduly limiting the Governor's flexibility to determine
SDA's for the State. The commenters recommended that the 10-percent provision be withdrawn from the final rule. A
few of the commenters suggested including a ``grandfather'' provision for existing SDA's in the regulations, if
the 10-percent provision is not removed in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that prospective entities seeking SDA status under the provisions of section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii)
and (B) of the Act serve a substantial portion/part of an LMA as a statutory criteria for designation. In the past, the
Department has deferred to the Governor's definition of ``substantial'' for the purposes of such designations,
which has resulted in a wide range of thresholds being established, from levels significantly below the 10 percent
provided for in the regulations, to a majority of an LMA. The Department reached the 10-percent figure taking into
consideration the need for a rational figure which would assist the Governors in the SDA designation process and still
ensure the statutory mandate for serving a substantial portion or part of an LMA, as appropriate. The regulations
still provide that the Governor defines these terms, with the 10 percent floor as a minimum requirement. The Department
believes that the 10-percent figure is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of the Act and the Secretary's
authority to promulgate regulations implementing the Act, while still maintaining the Governor's flexibility
in designating SDA's. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the suggestion that existing SDA's be ``grandfathered'' notwithstanding the 10-percent requirement, part 627,
Subpart I, Transition Provisions, of the interim final rule addresses this issue. The regulation, at &sect;627.904(l),
indicates that, at the Governor's discretion, SDA's designated prior to July 1, 1992, need not be subject to the provisions
at &sect;628.405. The Department does not believe that further clarification is needed. No change is made to the final
rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 628.410 of the interim final rule set forth requirements relating to the establishment and functioning of
the PIC. Comments on the provisions of this section fell mainly into three areas: PIC recertification, joint agreement
on the plan for Wagner-Peyser activities of the employment service and PIC representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters questioned the requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.410(a)(2) that the Governor recertify the PIC biennially, one year prior to the date of submission of the
job training plan. The commenters indicated that this requirement was an undue administrative burden and appeared
to go beyond the provisions of section 102(g) of the Act, which states: ``The Governor shall certify a private industry
council if the Governor determines that its composition and appointments are consistent with this subsection.''
In response to this concern, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.410(a)(2) is amended to require the Governor to review the PIC certification biennially rather than to
formally recertify the PIC. The review process is intended to afford the Governor a continuing role in ensuring that
the PIC is an effective local policy making body. The requirements specified in &sect;628.410(a)(3) encompass three
areas: the PIC membership and the nomination process, the PIC/chief elected official agreement, and the responsibilities
of the PIC to carry out its role.

Several commenters indicated that the requirement for a new PIC/CEO agreement was beyond the requirements of the
Act and was potentially disruptive of agreements and arrangements that had been carefully and delicately worked
out at the inception of JTPA. There is no requirement to negotiate or renegotiate an otherwise satisfactory agreement
which is in place. The regulations only require the Governor to review the sufficiency of the PIC/CEO agreement in
terms of the requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments on &sect;628.410(a)(3) of the interim final rule which requested clarification of the meaning
of paragraph (a)(3)(iv), this paragraph is removed in the final rule, since it is largely redundant of the contents
of the PIC/CEO agreement and the material that follows in paragraph (b) which the Governor may review in the course
of normal oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked for clarification on the components of the Wagner-Peyser plan which were applicable to SDA's.
The SESA agreement requirements are set forth in the Wagner-Peyser Act, at section 8(b)(1). These requirements generally
deal with employment service operational plans for carrying out the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act which must
be developed jointly with the PIC and local chief elected official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding PIC membership selection, a few comments touched on the selection process for representatives of organized
labor. One comment asked that the regulations define ``labor federation'' to mean the AFL&hyph;CIO at the State and
local levels and that a process be instituted for the Chief Elected Official (CEO) to ensure PIC representation by
the local AFL&hyph;CIO rather than by individual workers. As provided in section 102(c)(3) of the Act, CEO's are to
consult recognized State and local labor federations for recommendations for the labor representatives to the PIC
and not an individual labor organization. For this reason, a description of the nomination process is specifically
required to be included in the PIC certification to be reviewed by the Governor. The Department agrees, however, that
there is a need for clarification as to what constitutes a labor federation and is adding language in the final rule,
at &sect;628.410(a)(3), to indicate that a labor federation is an alliance of two or more labor unions, an example
of which is the AFL&hyph;CIO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to PIC representation in general, several commenters stressed the importance of ensuring that the nomination
process is opened up to balance important interests in the community, including the interests of older individuals
and women. The Department recognizes the importance of balanced demographic and community interest representation
and sensitivity to the diverse populations being served. This sensitivity is best displayed at the local level where
the composition of the community is known. While the Department strongly encourages CEO's and PIC's to make every
effort to assure that PIC membership is broadly representative of the community, the Department does not believe
it is appropriate to require this result through national rules. Thus, the Department has decided not to impose membership
requirements beyond those enumerated in section 102 of the Act. In communities with public housing agencies, given
the similarities in target populations, the Department does, however, encourage chief elected officials to include
such representation in their PIC membership under the category of ``public assistance agency''.

A few commenters were concerned that appointing representatives of certain kinds of organizations to the PIC would
represent an inherent conflict of interest. Conflict of interest rules for PIC members are discussed in Procurement
(&sect;627.420(c)(4)).

Selection of SDA Grant Recipient and Administrative Entity

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that the intent of this section was unclear. The Department believes that the lack of clarity
may pertain to the kinds of criteria that the Governor may establish that would affect the PIC's and CEO's selection
of a grant recipient and administrative entity. The Act, at section 103(b)(1)(B), specifies entities that may be
selected as grant recipient and administrative entity, which may be the PIC, a unit of local government or a non-profit
organization. While the Governor may establish criteria for the selection of grant recipients and administrative
entities, the criteria may not specifically exclude a type of entity specified in the Act from being selected.

Job Training Plan

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 628.420 through 628.430 deal with the submission, review and approval of the job training plan. There were
a few comments regarding the contents of the job training plan which are addressed in &sect;628.420(b)(1), through
a reference to the requirements of section 104(b) of the Act. There were requests for certain specific references
in the text of the regulation. One comment requested that the requirements of the NEW Act be specifically referenced.
As previously discussed in this supplementary information section, the Department agrees and has added a reference
to the requirements of section 104(b)(7) in &sect;628.420(b)(1). Another commenter requested that a specific reference
be made to consultation with public housing agencies. While these agencies are not specifically referenced in section
104 of the Act, they are included among those agencies with which the SDA is to develop the coordination and linkage
arrangements that would be described pursuant to section 104(b)(4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters raised concerns about the requirement in paragraph (e) of &sect;628.420 that modifications are
to be submitted jointly by the PIC and chief elected officials (CEO's) to the Governor. These commenters appear to
be confusing modifications to the SDA job training plan with contract modifications. The commenters stated that
the procurement regulations in &sect;627.420 require that every contract change order, such as a decrease of one
participant, necessitates a contract modification. The procurement process requirements in &sect;627.420 do
not apply to the plan and plan modification process, and &sect;628.420(e) addresses the requirements for the modification
of the job training plan, not contract modifications. Language is added to paragraph (e) to clarify that a ``major''
modification is to be specified by the Governor. In so specifying, the Department suggests that the Governor consider
conditions which result in a variance of 20 percent from the approved plan in the budget, level of participant services,
number of participants served, participant outcomes, or other core elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, there was an inadvertent oversight in the interim final rule in &sect;628.420(d) and (e), concerning the
submission of local plans or plan modifications to the Governor. The interim final rule indicated that the plan or
plan modifications must be jointly submitted but omitted the statutory requirement that such plans or plan modifications
also must be jointly approved as a condition for submittal to the Governor. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of &sect;628.420
are amended to more accurately reflect the statutory provisions of section 103(d) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the time limit provided in &sect;628.426(b) for chief elected officials and the PIC
to correct any deficiencies the Governor identifies in disapproving a job training plan be changed from 20 days to
30 days to allow SDA's adequate time. This change is incorporated into the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a commenter requested that the final rule clarify that the references in the Act and regulations refer to
``working days''. In fact, this is not the case and the references, as is the practice, refer to consecutive calendar
days. No change is made in the final rule.

The Act contains significant requirements in the front-end operations for most SDA's, which will cause major alterations
in the intake structure and will necessitate revisions in the appraisal of each participant's capabilities, needs,
and occupational goals. In the final regulations, the Department has provided necessary direction based on the Amendments
and has clarified and highlighted significant changes from the ``old'' statute.

Eligibility Determination and Intake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two major criteria must be considered in the process of determining which applicants are eligible for title II JTPA
program services. As set forth in &sect;628.505, the first criterion is age. The second is economic disadvantage.
The standard for determining economic disadvantage will be income as described in the annual Department of Health
and Human Services poverty guidelines. The use of these guidelines provides a standardized income determination
across federally funded programs. The Department's approach to the eligibility determination process has been
to attempt to minimize the amount of documentation necessary to establish an individual's eligibility for services,
while maintaining the necessary safeguards to prevent misuse of program funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters encouraged a streamlining of the eligibility documentation process, including use of self-attestation.
Several requested guidance on what documentation would be required for barriers. The Department has issued, in February
1993, and provided training on an eligibility documentation TAG to be used by SDA's in the eligibility determination
process. This should provide clarification of these issues. The procedures in this title II, Eligibility Documentation
TAG, if followed by the SDA's, will protect them from audit disallowances based on inadequate documentation. In response
to several comments that the Department should stick by its guidance, the final rule clarifies the intent of the interim
final rule that when it is determined that the State, SDA or service provider followed the Department's written guidance,
the Grant Officer will not disallow costs related to required documentation of an individual's eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.510 describes the requirements for intake, targeting and referral of applicants. During the intake
process, personal data on individuals are collected and a preliminary determination regarding suitability for
title II services is made. A number of commenters expressed the need for clarification of the suitability issue. Suitability
for program participation is a determination, based on preliminary information, of which eligible applicants should
be considered for JTPA program services. This determination is made against the backdrop of the limited availability
of JTPA resources and services and the practical necessity that the JTPA program must decide which individuals fall
within the 5 to 10 percent of the eligible population that can be served. It includes a determination whether an individual
falls within a category targeted for service by virtue of having a ``barrier'' to employment and whether there are
other programs and services reasonably available to an individual within the community. The JTPA title II program
is not intended or structured to remove all barriers to employment that applicants for services may have. Therefore,
the suitability determination also should consider which eligible applicants, with the provision of locally available
supportive services, can best be served and benefit from JTPA participation by acquisition of educational and occupational
skills or competencies and eventual employment. The regulations provide that some limited assessment activities
may be undertaken, the results of which may be used in connection with a determination of suitability. A determination
that an individual may be eligible but not suitable results in referrals to other sources of assistance, provision
of information on other programs, or in the case of a service provider, in referral to the SDA for further consideration.
In making suitability determinations, SDA's should keep in mind their obligations under applicable civil rights
and equal opportunity laws. SDA's should consider advising applicants of the process and possible results of intake,
assessment and suitability determinations and, particularly, that not all eligible applicants can be served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to focus program services on harder to serve individuals, not less than 65 percent of participants must have
one or more barriers to employment, as specified at section 203(b) of the Act. SDA's may also specify an additional
barrier for each of the title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C programs. An example of an appropriate ``additional barrier''
under section 203(b)(7) of the Act was requested. In response to this request, the Department is providing several
examples, however, SDA's are not limited to these and are encouraged to develop ``additional barrier'' guidelines
tailored to local population and labor market needs. For communities with public housing, the Department believes
that ``public housing assistance recipients'' who are otherwise income eligible would constitute an appropriate
``additional barrier''. An employment-authorized refugee might be included, as well as a displaced homemaker,
or substance abuser. Finally, the Department counsels that a member of a group protected under the civil rights statutes
may not be designated as having a barrier to employment solely on the basis of the characteristics that cause them to
fall under the civil rights legislation. So, for example, a racial group could not be designated under the additional
barrier provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification of the documentation requirements for referrals in &sect;628.510(d).
The Department describes the minimum required documentation at &sect;628.510(d) and at &sect;628.530(c). The
Department expects that SDA's will develop standardized information on programs and services available in the community.
This information may be provided in written form to the eligible applicant. A record of the referral will be maintained
and may take the form of an incomplete ISS. No further followup is required beyond referral. Section 628.510(d) is
revised to incorporate this principle. The idea is that the SDA must assume some limited responsibility to eligible
applicants who come for services even though the Act recognizes that not all will be served. The SDA should be in a better
position than an individual applicant to be aware of the services available within the community and to make referrals
so that the applicant can benefit from these other sources. In part, this is a principle behind recent initiatives
by States, SDA's and the Department to facilitate a concept of ``one-stop'' service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;628.510(d) is amended to specifically mention referrals to Job Corps to parallel the amendment
to &sect;628.803(d)(2). This change is made to foster JTPA/Job Corps coordination.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 628.510(e) describes the requirement for service providers to refer eligible applicants or participants
who cannot be served by its program back to the SDA for further assessment, if necessary, and suitable referral to other
appropriate programs. Several commenters questioned whether there is a requirement for centralized intake. There
is no such requirement. The requirement is that the SDA put in place a system that works independently of an individual
service provider. This ``system'' would also cover situations described by commenters in which the SDA administrative
entity does not perform intake. In other words, an SDA must have some mechanism by which an eligible applicant or participant
can be considered for enrollment in all of the services available through the SDA, not just those of a single service
provider. The Department believes that this is a program design issue for local discretion and that there will be a
number of effective approaches to meet these requirements. The intent of the regulation is simply to assure that participants
will be exposed to the full range of available services and that they will have a fair opportunity to receive services
appropriate to their individual needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States and/or SDA's will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the targeting requirements of sections
203 and 263 of the Act and to determine actions to address noncompliance with the requirements. Many commenters questioned
how compliance would be calculated. Some noted that a strict reading of the Act would provide that any ``participant''
(i.e., any individual who has been determined eligible and received a service, including objective assessment)
could be included in the calculation to meet the targeting requirement. Others observed that while assessment was
an important activity, it did not necessarily constitute a training or employment service that would result in a measurable
outcome of the effectiveness of the program. In considering the comments, the Department recognizes that, at the
suggestion of individuals identifying implementation issues, it was determined that only individuals enrolled
in an activity subsequent to objective assessment would be included in performance standards calculations. The
rationale for that decision was that many individuals had not made a final decision to participate in the program and
have dropped out before any meaningful intervention. Therefore, for consistency, the Department has determined
that the 65-percent requirement also is to be calculated on those participants who receive services or training subsequent
to the objective assessment. Section 628.510 is revised to add a new paragraph (f)(2) to this effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Objective Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Objective assessment should be a continuous, customer-centered and flexible process. The objective assessment
should not be viewed as a discrete activity that begins and ends early in the stages of program participation, but rather
as one that will continue throughout participation in JTPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments received on the front-end design of the JTPA program discussed the assessment process. All supported
the concept and the intent of individualized program services. A few commenters expressed concern over staff development
needs for implementing assessment. Many commenters requested guidance in the development of assessment and service
strategies. While the Department expects that States and SDA's will retain authority for program design, technical
assistance has and will continue to be provided on assessment and development of the ISS. The Department encourages
use of funds for the capacity building of staff (see &sect;628.325), including staff training in objective assessment
techniques; however, the Department declines to establish credentialing standards as one commenter suggested.
The Department believes that staffing and standards should be a State and local decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters addressed confidentiality issues arising in the intake, assessment and referral processes. The
same kinds of concerns over disclosure of information were expressed in connection with the discussion of &sect;627.463.
The Department has not addressed confidentiality in &sect;627.515 because confidentiality issues are not new.
The Department thinks that traditional standards of professional conduct on confidentiality issues should be continued.
Further, the Department expects that protections against the disclosure of information that would constitute a
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, as permitted by section 165(a)(4)(B)(i) of the Act, will protect
the confidentiality of customer information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters expressed confusion over the determination of when an applicant becomes a participant, how
much assessment could be provided at the intake/ eligibility stage prior to enrollment of an eligible applicant and
to which cost category this would be charged. Costs incurred on behalf of an applicant, including intake, eligibility
and suitability determination (which may include some limited assessment of an applicant), and any assessment necessary
to facilitate the eligibility determination, consistent with the provisions of &sect;627.440(d)(3)(i) are to
be charged to the training-related and supportive services cost category. Once an applicant is determined to be eligible
and the decision made to enroll the applicant, a full objective assessment may begin and the applicant may receive
other program services. As specified in &sect;627.440(d)(1)(i), assessment at this stage may be charged to the direct
training cost category. Receipt of objective assessment or other services would confer participant status consistent
with the definition of participant in section 4(37) of the Act. The Department believes that the preoccupation with
participant status may be misplaced because the principal issue of program credit has been addressed in the context
of when the performance standards are to be applied.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department expects assessment of eligible applicants to be used only in those cases when an eligible applicant's
suitability for enrollment is unclear. While the regulations afford an opportunity to charge the costs of preliminary
assessment functions to the training-related and supportive services cost category to aid in the determination
of an applicant's suitability, the Department expects the restriction on the cost categories to act as a natural control
on SDA's while still allowing the flexibility for individual decisions. The Department would like to emphasize that
the limited availability of funds will restrict over-use of preliminary assessment as part of the decision to enroll.
SDA's are expected to finance intensive services expected to enable participants to complete successfully the longer
term JTPA service strategies within this cost category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.515 sets forth the requirements of the objective assessment. The scope of the objective assessment should
not be limited to only services or training programs already available in an SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether basic skills evaluation was required as part of the objective assessment. The
Department intends the evaluation to be of both basic and occupational skills. The definition of ``objective assessment''
in &sect;628.515(b)(1) is revised, therefore, to include basic as well as occupational skills evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective assessment is ongoing and should not be viewed as a one-time event. It should be a multi-faceted process
which includes a full array of options including items such as structured interviews, paper and pencil tests, performance
tests, behavioral observations, interest inventories, career guidance instruments, aptitude tests, and basic
skills tests. From these options, and others, assessment staff may select the most appropriate tools for each participant
to measure skills, abilities, aptitudes, interests, supportive service and financial needs, and to counsel participants
on how their assessment results relate to local labor market demands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SDA's are strongly encouraged to prudently select appropriate measuring tools that will provide necessary information
for the reasonable development of an individual service strategy leading to a realistic employment goal. JTPA resources
are limited and JTPA is not an entitlement program. The Department expects SDA's to develop practical applications
for career counseling and assessments for basic skills and occupational training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective assessment process should be sensitive to the testing and evaluation environment and the comfort and
confidence level of the participant. The temptation to over-test or over-evaluate, providing excess information
for which there is no immediate application, does not serve the customer's best interest, is detrimental to the customer/
counselor relationship, and is costly to the SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective assessment is to be revisited regularly and the resulting information used to amend the ISS, as appropriate,
when additional needs are identified or goals achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessments recently conducted by other human service programs or schools are viable options and their use is encouraged,
where appropriate, rather than requiring the customer to undergo additional assessments that duplicate information
already obtained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department notes that the objective assessment process for title II&hyph;B may be different in scope
than that for the regular title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C program, as indicated in &sect;628.515(b)(2). This may also
be the case for limited function programs (such as literacy programs) mounted under section 123, although this is
clearly an exception to the normal expectation in conducting an assessment.

Individual Service Strategy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 628.520 establishes the requirements for the Individual Service Strategy (ISS). The ISS is an individual
plan that is developed based on information obtained through the objective assessment. It is the framework within
which decisions regarding individual participants are recorded. It should be considered a living document that
reflects decisions concerning the appropriate mix and sequence of services to be provided leading to, and including,
a realistic employment goal. Several commenters requested clarification of the outcomes to be sought in the development
of the ISS for youth. The Department agrees that there is a need to focus on youth returning to or remaining in school
and, thus, that the ISS should focus more on education as it relates to a long term career. In title II&hyph;B and II&hyph;C,
the employment goal should be interpreted broadly for those individuals returning to school and may reflect long-term
career goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked for clarification of what had to be listed in the ISS. The ISS should briefly note any need for
financial resources or supportive services and record the amount of each. The expected outcome of each activity should
be indicated with a notation of the provision and schedule for each. Referral to other programs, and referral out of
title II must be noted on the ISS. The rationale or justification for other decisions may be referenced in the ISS, but
need not be recorded there. The Department provides further clarification of the use of the ISS for recording referrals
out of title II by revising &sect;628.530(c), as was requested by several commenters. This section now states that
further tracking or follow-up is not required for referrals out of title II. This section is also revised to correct
language in the interim final regulations that indicated referrals out of title II would not be calculated in performance
standards only if an ISS had not been completed. Since, as commenters noted, an ISS is to be developed for each participant,
this section now allows recording the referral in a partial ISS without any effect on performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters indicated confusion over counseling and the development of the job goal in the ISS. The provisions
of this section reflect the need for program-related application of career counseling, but the Department cautions
program operators to prudently provide career counseling related to the realistic goals of the JTPA program. While
the objective assessment/individual service strategy process is customer-centered, JTPA services are expected
to guide participants toward realistic employment goals for which training and job demand are available in the community.
Pure career counseling for its own sake should be left to other, more appropriate, sources. Development of a final
employment goal may be delayed where the objective assessment indicates a need for further career exploration or
assessment. In this case, a career cluster should temporarily be indicated in place of the employment goal. The ISS
should be revised to reflect the employment goal prior to the start of specific occupational skills training. The
employment goal may be revised if the continuing objective assessment indicates a need to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments were received concerning participant signatures on the ISS. This requirement was perceived
as an unnecessary administrative burden. Section 628.520(c) is revised to indicate that there is not a requirement
for a participant signature. However, the decisions reflected in the service strategy about goals, objectives and
services to be provided are to be made in partnership with the participant and are to be determined in conformance with
applicable civil rights provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Participant signatures on the ISS may be requested, but are not required to indicate the joint development of the document.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department encourages communication with participants and reminds program operators, especially program
monitors and auditors, that the intent of the ISS is to be a program tool and not a compliance document that forms the
basis for cost disallowance. The Department does not doubt that participant records, including the ISS, will be reviewed
to determine whether SDA's and others have adhered to certain requirements of the Act. This is unavoidable. However,
for the ISS to have the anticipated value as a program tool, it must not be developed and used with compliance in mind,
but rather with the needs of the customer as its focus. One commenter suggested that if documentation is required,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to document a payment decision, that it be recorded elsewhere in the participant record so that the ISS and compliance
documentation can be kept separate. While somewhat artificial, if this concept helps, the Department has no objection
to using it. Ultimately, however, the decision on how much detailed information to record on the ISS is one for States
and SDA's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule is revised by adding a new paragraph (h) in &sect;628.520 to emphasize that the ISS is a working record
of progress and references to ``documentation'' are revised to read ``record.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISS, to be effective, must be regularly reviewed and adjusted to reflect the progress and to meet the continuing
needs of each participant. The ISS will serve as the basis for the entire case management strategy. Case management
is an allowable direct training activity and the Department encourages its use as an effective strategy for providing
quality services to the participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters indicated confusion over the application of case management to the JTPA program. The Department
encourages application of case management principles to participant services. In section 4(32) of the Act, the term
case management is defined to mean the provision of a customer-centered approach in the delivery of services, designed
to prepare and coordinate comprehensive employment plans to ensure access to the necessary training and supportive
services, and to provide job and career counseling during program participation and after job placement. The Department
expects SDA's to make every reasonable effort to provide the services and training indicated by the assessment and
ISS and, where possible, to apply standard case management principles. The Department recognizes, however, that
JTPA is not an entitlement program and that not all services and training will be available regardless of the level
of coordination in an area. Case management is an administrative management tool, not an individual service to be
delivered to participants. There is no change in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters expressed concern over the ability to provide all services indicated by the objective assessment
and the ISS. Section 628.520(e) recognizes that an SDA may not always be able to provide the full array of services indicated
by the objective assessment and recorded in the ISS. In arranging for the mix and sequence of appropriate services,
it is fully expected that SDA's will refer participants to other programs for certain specified activities as part
of the JTPA service strategy. In those cases, particularly in rural areas, where services required are indicated
on the ISS and not available from any source in the SDA, such information is to be recorded in the ISS and an alternate
plan developed which may include referral to another program. SDA's are expected to make every reasonable effort
to make available the recommended training or services to each participant; however, consistent with &sect;628.525,
it is understood that the objective assessment and ISS do not give legal or entitlement rights to participants for
services. JTPA is not an entitlement program and available resources are limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters thought that language in the preamble to the interim final regulations authorized States and SDA's
not to serve the disabled or other hard-to-serve persons, if they needed substantial supportive services. The Department
acknowledges that it may have inadvertently suggested that an individual, with excessive supportive service needs,
such as a person with a disability, could automatically be referred out of the program to other sources. This is not
the case. Such decisions must be made on the basis of the individual's and the program's circumstances. While JTPA
is not required to directly serve every person, including every person with a disability, it is intended to focus more
on the hard-to-serve. The fact that an individual may be difficult or costly to serve should not, in itself, preclude
serving that person.

Consistent with &sect;628.520(f), service providers and contractors may conduct the objective assessment and
develop the ISS. It is the responsibility of the SDA administrative entity to ensure that the objective assessment
and the development of the ISS reflect the customer-centered approach required by law are provided to each participant
whether they are provided in-house or by service providers.

In response to comments on the provisions of &sect;628.510 and &sect;628.530, &sect;628.525 is also revised for

Referrals of Eligible Applicants and Participants to Other Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final regulations further clarify the subject of referrals of both eligible applicants and participants due
to confusion expressed by a number of commenters. The regulations, at &sect;628.510(d) and at &sect;628.530(c),
specify the requirements for referral of eligible applicants and participants for whom available title II services
are not deemed suitable or adequate to appropriate human service programs in the community. Section 628.510(d) deals
with the situation in which an eligible applicant is referred to non-title II services during the intake process.
Section 628.530 refers to referrals of participants, those individuals who have been determined to be eligible and
have begun to receive objective assessment or other services. In the final regulations, both provisions are revised
for clarity and to reduce the burden of documenting the referrals. Section 628.510(d) allows the SDA to conduct limited
assessment of eligible applicants as a part of a determination of suitability, before they are enrolled as participants.
The purpose of this pre-participation assessment is to enable SDA's to make more precise judgments as to the suitability
of the applicant for participation in JTPA and/or additional services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsibility of the SDA at this point in the intake process is to assure that eligible applicants not suitable
for title II participation are ``provided information on the full array of applicable or appropriate services that
are available.'' (Section 204(a)(2)(A) of the Act) and that necessary arrangements are made for individuals to make
contact with those services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.530(c) addresses referral of participants out of title II services. A number of commenters indicated
concern over burdensome paperwork requirements for referral of participants to other than title II programs. The
Department has addressed these concerns by amending &sect;628.320(c) to permit referral decisions for participants
with whom there will be no continuing relationship to be recorded in a partial ISS. No further tracking of such referred
participants is required. Of course, where there will be a continuing relationship with the referred participant,
&sect;628.530(a) provides that the referral decision should be recorded in the ISS and that the participant's progress
should be tracked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of service providers who discover that an eligible applicant cannot be served by its program, &sect;628.510(e)
requires that service providers refer such individuals to the SDA for further assessment and referral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clarification of referral responsibilities was requested by a number of commenters. In addition to the above explanations,
&sect;628.510(d) and &sect;628.530(c) are revised to specify that no follow-up is required for referrals of eligible
applicants or participants with whom there will not be a continuing relationship. Further, the Department wishes
to point out that either an applicant or a participant may be referred out of JTPA at any time, if warranted by customer
need or preference. Some commenters seemed to think that both an objective assessment and ISS ``must be completed''
prior to referral outside the program. Since both assessment and the ISS are presumed to be continually reviewed and
evolving during participation, this assumption is not warranted.

Job Search Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fundamental change in section 204(c)(2) of the Act regarding program design is the requirement that job search,
job clubs, and work experience activities be accompanied by other services that increase a participant's educational
and occupational skills. This change reflects evidence that, in some cases, suggests that quick turnaround placement
programs have minimal long-term impact when provided in isolation from other more comprehensive and intensive services.
The Department's Inspector General, in a 1988 report, concluded that the number of JTPA participants on public assistance
was only slightly reduced after completion of JTPA programs. On the other hand, The National JTPA Study found a 39%
earnings gain for adult women from the provision of stand alone job search services. This new limitation reflects
an overall thrust of JTPA to provide quality services to participants. For example, short-term job search assistance
alone might result in a job placement for low-skilled individuals, but job retention is not likely without concomitant
services aimed at increasing participants' needed basic or occupational skills. Accordingly, &sect;628.535 codifies
section 204(c)(2)(B) of the Act which limits the provision of stand-alone job search assistance, job search skills
training, and job club activities to title II participants. ``Job search assistance'' itself is defined in &sect;626.5.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments generally addressed two issues: Interfacing with the Employment Service (ES), and the preference of older
individuals for immediate job placement. With regard to the Employment Service, many questioned the ability of the
local ES office to provide adequate services to JTPA participants. They were concerned that ES may lack in-house expertise
to provide sufficient assistance for groups with special needs. Citing the provisions in the Act governing the determination
of duplicative services, several commenters believed that the ability of the ES office to provide assistance to special
needs groups should be a criterion for this determination. Others pointed out that, since job search activities are
a critical part of any ISS, and service providers have already established successful networks of employer contacts,
ES offices should not be the presumptive deliverer for providing adequate job search activities for all participants.
These commenters suggested that &sect;628.535(d) be either deleted or revised to permit SDA's to determine whether
to use the ES to provide job search services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, several commenters stated that allowing SDA's to determine unilaterally whether adequate job
search assistance is available through the local ES office (&sect;628.535(c)(2)) defeats one of the basic goals
of the Amendments: To focus JTPA on providing more training and less stand-alone job placement. Unless there is a mechanism
for ES input into the determination as to whether job search services are available, the concern is that an SDA could
simply assert that services are not available to avoid coordinating with the ES, leading to duplication. One suggestion
was that the Governor decide the criteria for the availability of job search assistance. Another commenter stated
that any requirement to document that job search services are unavailable from the ES for each participant or training
program should be done only once per program year or Job Training Plan cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter pointed out that because job search assistance was defined as a service ``designed to give a participant
skills in acquiring full-time employment,'' and the local job service office was considered the appropriate purveyor
of these skills (&sect;628.535(d)), this provision should be removed because ES offices may not always be able to
provide such services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department decided not to remove &sect;628.535(d) because it interprets section 204(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act
to accord the employment service a special status in terms of providing job search. Also, this provision of the Act
is not substantially different from the provisions of sections 107 and 141 of the Act which prohibit duplication of
services. It remains to be determined whether job search assistance is universally available within each community
from the Employment Service. The SDA may look at whether local employment service resources are sufficient to provide
the job search assistance for all potential JTPA referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, at &sect;628.535(d), is amended to indicate that a determination is to be made by the SDA in active consultation
with the employment service and other public agencies. These determinations must be documented in the SDA's job training
plan since the employment service is on the PIC and coordination with the employment service is among the topics to
be included in the plan. Standardized inquiries regarding local job search assistance availability from the employment
service may be developed by the Governor in consultation with the State ES Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters representing older workers recommended either a waiver of the stand-alone job search limitations
for this population or a provision allowing the Governor to request a waiver when sufficient evidence demonstrates
that the interests of older workers would not be well served by these limitations. These commenters recognized the
priority placed on training for younger individuals but expressed doubts that career training was a realistic and
relevant goal for older workers who, generally are not attracted to long-term assistance that mandates skills training,
who do not thrive in classroom training designed for youth and young adults, and who do not tend to seek assistance from
the ES or other public agency environments. For these reasons, several commenters asked that older workers, or the
older worker set-aside program, be exempted from this section altogether and that job search assistance be a service
strategy for this population without justification in the ISS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered these comments carefully and has decided that, like all title II&hyph;A participants,
older worker participants require assessment and need a justification in the ISS for stand-alone job search activities.
However, a new &sect;628.535(e) is added in the final regulations to recognize the preference of older individuals
for immediate job placement and to provide some flexibility in recognition of the special characteristics of older
workers. The Department's view is that this provision should not establish a routine practice to avoid the provision
of needed training services. The intent of the JTPA program remains to provide needed services to the hard to serve,
including older workers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters noted an ambiguity in the interim final regulations, that &sect;628.804(d) and (e) limit the provision
of preemployment and work maturity skills training and work experience, in addition to job search assistance, unless
they are accompanied by additional services; while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.535(b)(2) states, as an example, that work experience can be combined with job search training. Accordingly,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.535(b)(2) is revised to specifically exclude this example as well as other services which may not be used
to meet the combination requirement. Additional services which may be provided in conjunction with job search may
include the training services specified in JTPA section 204(b)(1), except stand-alone skill assessment, counseling,
work experience and case management, and the direct training services listed in 264(b) of the Act excluding tutoring,
stand-alone skill assessment, counseling, work experience and case management. Commenters also pointed out that
the title II&hyph;C program does not contain an ``exceptions'' provision to this requirement as section 204(c)(2)(B)(ii)
of the Act does for the title II&hyph;A program. To address this inconsistency, &sect;628.535(c) is amended to state
that the exceptions are not applicable to title II&hyph;C. On the other hand, it is important to note that, for the purposes
of this section, because title II&hyph;C in-school youth are enrolled in educational programs, they meet the requirement
of being enrolled in ``other additional services'' (&sect;628.804(d) and (e)).

Several commenters felt that the requirements at &sect;628.540 were too restrictive and burdensome. In response,
and in consideration of the principle that a volunteer program should, in fact, be voluntary for former participants,
the Department is removing the goals, objectives and documentation requirements in the final rule. Section 628.540,
as revised, merely repeats the statutory requirement which the Department believes is self-explanatory. The Department
encourages the SDA's to work with former participants to have them share their experiences in the program and in the
workplace with current participants. The Department also advises the SDA's to document any use of JTPA funds for this
volunteer program.

Sections 205 and 265 of the Act require that SDA's operating adult and year-round youth programs establish appropriate
linkages with other Federal human resource programs, including Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) JOBS
program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Comprehensive Modernization Program, the Department
of Energy's (DOE) Low Income Weatherization Grant program and programs under the National Service Act. Other linkages
may also be established with appropriate State and local educational, social service, and public housing agencies,
including CBO's, business and labor organizations, volunteer groups and others, such as women and older worker organizations,
to avoid duplication and to enhance the delivery of services. In addition, youth programs are required to establish
linkages with appropriate educational agencies which include formal agreements for procedures for referring and
serving in-school youth, methods of assessment, notification when students drop out of school, and arrangements
with educational agencies for services for in-school and out-of-school youth. These provisions are reflected in
&sect;628.545. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters urged that coordination should begin at the Federal level. The Department agrees and has begun
discussions with a number of other Federal agencies to increase coordination at the Federal level and, as the commenters
requested, to seek ways to develop common definitions and procedures applicable across program lines. The commenters
were concerned that all the responsibility for coordination rests on the JTPA system. It is, of course, true that the
Act and these regulations, since they focus on the JTPA system place a burden on the system to be a prime mover in the process
of developing coordinated program relationships. A State or SDA is required to make good faith efforts to seek coordination
and cooperation where it is possible to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned the ability of SDA's to establish appropriate linkages if other agencies are not operating
under similar mandates. Some comments recommended that the Governor encourage coordination efforts through the
SJTCC and, where feasible, develop agreements at the State level which would provide the basis and authority for local
agreements and ensure the best utilization of funds between agencies. The Department agrees that these recommendations
are a good way to establish effective and systematic coordination and language to this effect is added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;628.545(a). The new language recognizes both the SJTCC and the HRIC, whichever is in place in a State, as useful
focus points for coordination efforts. In addition, a few comments referred to the importance of the SDA's documenting
instances of attempted coordination efforts and of sharing this information with the Governor's office. This provision
also is included in &sect;628.545(a) to link State coordination agreements with local achievements by means of the
job training plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to emphasize the importance of ``one-stop shop'' career centers and seamless ``single point of contact''
delivery systems, which was the concern of several commenters, a new &sect;628.545(b) is added. SDA's are encouraged
to facilitate such delivery systems in coordination with other agencies, which may include both the development
of ISS plans and of a common program application, as well as a unified job development effort and comprehensive program
design. Such linkages may provide for a JTPA entity jointly funding or administering a program with funds from another
agency, such as an SDA jointly funding aspects of a public housing agency's Comprehensive Modernization Program
or the local JOBS program. Alternatively, when appropriate, the SDA could earmark funds to be spent within public
housing areas for services to residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other coordination issues discussed were the difficulty of defining and receiving information on dropouts from
some local educational agencies and the fact that agreements should be limited to those education agencies which
plan in-school activities. With regard to obtaining information on school dropouts, the Department has initiated
discussions with the Department of Education with the goal of working out a common definition and systematic approach
for identifying and serving dropouts. In the meantime, States are encouraged to negotiate agreements with State
educational agencies to facilitate this task. With regard to limiting the agreements required at the local level
with educational agencies, &sect;628.545(c) is amended to reflect these concerns by the addition of the qualifying
terms ``appropriate'' and ``which participate in JTPA programs.''

Transfer of Funds

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters raised questions concerning timing issues not addressed in &sect;628.550 of the interim final rule:
whether transfers must occur at the beginning of the program year; whether they may occur at any time during the 3-year
funding period; and whether the provisions are applicable to the 1993 title II&hyph;B program. The Department does
not address these issues in the final rule, leaving the first two issues to be addressed at the Governor's discretion.
In response to the third issue, the provisions are applicable to the 1993 title II&hyph;B program; this issue is addressed
in the transition provisions at &sect;627.904(k)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, paragraph (b) is revised to permit transfers of up to 20% of the title II B funds allocated to an SDA under
section 252(b) of the Act to title II C. This change is consistent with the amendment made to section 256 of the Act by
the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;227.

Title II&hyph;A_The Adult Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the general requirements of title II&hyph;A appear in subpart E of part 628 of the interim final rule. There
are a few specific requirements of title II&hyph;A which appear in part 628, subpart F. These include sections on eligibility;
requirements to assist hard-to-serve individuals; types of training services, counseling and supportive services;
and linkages and coordination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who were confused about whether the provisions of the formula for allocation of funds set
a maximum age of participation at 72 years, &sect;628.605(a) is amended to clarify that there is no maximum age of participation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked for clarification on the determination of the 65-percent threshold of serving the hard-to-serve.
Section 628.605(c)(1) is amended to clarify that all participants, including the non-disadvantaged (10 percent
window), are considered in determining the 65 percent who are hard-to-serve. Section 628.605(c)(2) now addresses
the question of when, in the service continuum, an individual is counted for determining compliance with the 65-percent
barrier requirement by clarifying, as discussed earlier, that it is calculated upon participants who have received
a service subsequent to objective assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned the inconsistency in the provisions regarding the ten-percent window in section
204(d) of the Act and the provisions for eligibility in the basic title II&hyph;A program, set forth in &sect;628.605(e),
when an older worker is in a joint program between JTPA and title V of the Older Americans Act. As discussed in connection
with the provisions of &sect;628.320, this inconsistency has been addressed by the Congress in amendments to the
Older Americans Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, on the regulatory provisions of &sect;628.605(c) and &sect;628.803(d) addressing the 65-percent requirement,
several commenters asked what would be the ramifications of non-compliance. Of course, the Department does not expect
difficulty in meeting these requirements. Since the Act imposes these percentage service requirements, as well
as the requirement on the in-school, out-of-school 50/50-percent ratio, on participants and not to funds, the Department
believes that they would be the subject of administrative corrective action by the SDA and, subsequent action by the
Governor under the provisions of section 164(b)(1) of the Act and part 628, subpart G of the final rule, as appropriate.

Summer Youth Employment and Training Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart G of part 628 covers the Summer Youth Employment and Training Program (SYETP under title II&hyph;B, effective
with calendar year 1994. It reflects the policy of closer integration for youth between academic fundamentals (such
as reading and mathematics) and work requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters raised issues related to the SYETP authorized under title II&hyph;B. Several commenters requested
broad flexibility in the scope of the objective assessment and ISS required for summer program participants. Some
expressed the fear that these requirements will result in a reduction of the number of SYETP participants due to the
increased burden on current staff. The Department recognizes that the achievement objectives and resulting service
strategies for summer youth differ from what might be expected in the adult program and that the corresponding assessment
processes would vary accordingly. Section 253(c)(1)(A) of the Act states that SYETP programs shall include objective
assessment of the basic skills and the supportive service needs of each participant. The SDA may use school records
on math and reading levels to determine basic skills. Similarly, the fully developed ISS, described in subpart E,
is not required for a participant who is enrolled only in the SYETP, as is reflected in &sect;628.515(b)(2). For those
participants transferring to the year-round program under title II&hyph;C, the full objective assessment and ISS
would be required. The results of any post-title II&hyph;B participation test should be used as part of the assessment
process when transferring the individual to a program under title II&hyph;C. Within the limits imposed by any applicable
state or local privacy laws or rules, SDA's are encouraged to make as much use as possible of existing information from
schools and from title II&hyph;B participation in developing the full objective assessment for a transferring participant,
as well as sharing available JTPA information with school counselors and other appropriate school officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters addressed the inability of SDA's to provide the required basic and remedial education services without
reducing the number of youth served or other services to youth. While this is a difficult tradeoff in some areas, the
Department is bound by the emphasis in the amendments to provide educational services to participants. In some instances,
it may be necessary to reduce the number of participants served in order to get high-quality experiences under title
II&hyph;B. Coordination and leveraging of resources is recommended to allow more participants to receive educational
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to more closely conform to sections 251 and 253(a) of the Act, &sect;628.701(a), on Program Goals and Objectives,
is amended. The ``enhancement of basic educational skills'' is added to the list of possible SDA goals and objectives.
Other additions include ``encouragement of school completion or enrollment in supplementary or alternative school
programs'' and ``improvement of employability skills including provision of vocational exploration opportunities
and exposure to the world of work, and enhancement of youth citizenship skills.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters spoke of various difficulties involved with the determination and documentation of eligibility
under the National School Lunch Act. Guidance on eligibility verification pertaining to the determination and documentation
of eligibility under the National School Lunch Act will be developed in consultation with the Department of Agriculture
and will be provided outside of these regulations. See the further discussion of this subject in the section pertaining
to programs under title II&hyph;C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed previously, in connection with eligibility for the education coordination grant program,
the Department has determined that the criteria for eligibility, as they relate to the ``economically disadvantaged''
eligibility criterion and alternatives for in-school youth, should be consistently applied across programs under
parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act. Therefore, in addition to eligibility for free lunch under the National School
Lunch Act, the Department adds participation in a compensatory education program under title I chapter I of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act and in a schoolwide program, as specified at section 263(g) of the Act, to the criteria
at &sect;628.702 of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who raised the issue of the perceived limitation of 500 hours on the duration of work experience
for youth and its effect on the summer program, the Department refers to the discussion of work experience that appears
in connection with &sect;627.245 and the fact that the limitations on duration of work experience are removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.705(d), dealing with concurrent enrollment, is amended to clarify that 65 percent of the total number
of title II&hyph;C participants shall have one or more barriers to employment. This is necessary because no such additional
barrier to employment requirement exists in title II&hyph;B. The SDA must decide who is enrolled in title II&hyph;C
programs from title II&hyph;B or elsewhere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (e) on follow-up services is added to &sect;628.705. Section 253(d) of the Act requires that followup
services be provided for participants if the ISS indicates that such services are appropriate. Title II&hyph;B funds
may be used such follow-up services up to one year after program participation, including when this coincides with
title II&hyph;C participation when determined appropriate during participation in the title II&hyph;B program
and recorded in the participant record. All supportive services in section 4(24), except financial assistance,
are included in followup services. Appropriate followup activities for title II&hyph;B participants include counseling,
mentoring, or tutoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with the enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, there were amendments to the program under Title
II&hyph;B. The Department believes that these are important changes and wishes to call attention to them in this rulemaking
process. Therefore, some of the statutory provisions have been directly included in this final rule at &sect;628.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters suggested that the term ``out-of-school youth'' be clarified or defined in &sect;628.803(h).
Several commenters specifically cited attendance in an alternative school or education program as a criterion.
A few commenters specifically said that the Congressional Conference Committee Report makes clear that this definition
encompasses youth enrolled in alternative education programs. They encouraged the inclusion of alternative education
programs in the definition of ``out-of-school youth''. Other comments stressed a combination of options including
students attending area learning centers, adult basic education classes, general educational development (GED)
preparation, vocational schools, or colleges. Others wanted truants, dropouts, and those on suspension status
specifically included. One recommended that the State define out-of-school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wanted the term ``in-school youth'' clarified or defined. Some commenters had specific suggestions
such as leaving the definition up to the Governor or placing it in &sect;625.5, Definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an earlier attempt to provide administrative clarification in this area, the Department had provided guidance
to the Regional Offices on the definition of ``in-school youth'' and out-of-school youth'' in Field Memorandum No.
34&hyph;93. This guidance indicated that an in-school youth was a youth who had not received a high school degree and
was attending school on a full-time compulsory basis. An out-of-school youth was a youth who was not in school, or as
suggested by the report of the Conferees, was attending alternative school or was habitually truant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comments to the Department, it was indicated that the interim guidance was problematic for two reasons. First,
a 14 or 15-year-old youth attending alternative school would not be eligible to participate if defined as out-of-school
since a 14 or 15-year-old could only be eligible as in-school youth. Second, if a youth was in alternative school and
considered in-school by the school system, but defined as out-of-school for JTPA, the eligibility criteria of participation
in a compensatory education program or eligibility for free lunch could not be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue is of some interest to the JTPA system, especially in light of the requirement that at least 50 percent of the
youth served be out-of-school youth. The Department has given careful consideration to this matter and has determined
to take a slightly different course. The regulations define ``in-school youth'' at &sect;628.803(b). The Department
has not included the concept of being subject to compulsory attendance requirements because in some States these
requirements end at an age before a youth has attained a diploma and the Department believes that attainment of a diploma
is key to the criteria for being in school. The word ``diploma'' is substituted for ``degree'' to distinguish from
post-secondary attainment. Any other youth is out-of-school. Rather than further define ``out-of-school'' in
a way that would create the problems noted above or create a number of unnecessary exceptions, the Department has decided
to adopt, in &sect;628.803(h), the exceptions suggested in the Conference Report which set forth the requirement
that 50-percent of youth served must be out-of-school. The Conference Report indicates that youth in alternative
schools or who are ``habitually truant'' may be considered as out-of-school for purposes of meeting the statutory
requirement. ``Alternative school'' also is defined. Section 628.803(h) is revised accordingly so that paragraph
(h)(2) is redesignated as paragraph (h)(3) and a new paragraph (h)(2) is added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned that the status of high school graduates was unclear. The intent of the revision
of the definitions in the final rule is to make it clear that all youth who are not in-school are out-of-school. Thus,
high school graduates or GED recipients, who are not enrolled in post-secondary education programs, would qualify
as out-of-school youth. It should be stressed, however, that the primary intent of including the ``out-of-school''
eligibility category in title II&hyph;C was to stress services to high school dropouts. SDA's should focus their
services on this group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted the problems with documenting the free lunch program as an eligibility criterion for youth.
That program has strict confidentiality provisions. One urged the Department to work with the appropriate agency
to improve the existing process. While section 9 of the National School Lunch Act assures confidentiality, schools
may release summary information such as the number of eligible children in a school. Parents may sign waivers of confidentiality
for specific programs. Households may voluntarily provide evidence of eligibility. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) is requesting that their regional offices notify State agencies of these regulations and suggest they share
this information with local school administrators. The Department plans to work with USDA staff to coordinate this
effort. Section 628.803(c) is amended to reflect that the Department will provide further guidance on the verification
of documentation regarding the free lunch program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the requirement to serve hard-to-serve individuals, &sect;628.803(d)(2) is amended to state that all
Job Corps participants shall be considered as out-of-school and shall be automatically considered to have a barrier
to employment. This change is made to foster JTPA/Job Corps coordination. SDA's now will have an incentive to provide
job development and placement services for Job Corps participants. All positive program terminations will be enjoyed
by both systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter sought clarification as to whether non-economically disadvantaged youth enrolled as a part of a schoolwide
project are to be counted as part of the 10 percent non-economically disadvantaged stated in &sect;628.803(f). As
stated in &sect;628.803(h)(2), these youth do not count against the 10-percent window. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters sought clarification of the provisions of the regulations regarding title II&hyph;C eligibility based
on schoolwide project participation. Section 628.803 is amended to add a paragraph (g)(3) to restate the provisions
of the Act on the criteria for schools that qualify for schoolwide projects, and a paragraph (g)(4) which states that
the SDA determines its schoolwide projects and provides a list of examples of possible projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter pointed out that section 263(g)(1)(C) of the Act requires that projects be in schools in which not less
than 70 per cent are hard-to-serve and that the regulations should define a reasonable standard to determine this.
This is addressed in DOL's Technical Assistance Guide on Eligibility which specifies that the school makes the certification
that 70 percent of its students meet the criteria. The SDA may rely upon the school's certification for purposes of
compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters suggested that for a school-wide project, an entire school district should be allowed to qualify
and not just an individual school. The Department believes that the provisions of the Act clearly apply to an individual
school. No change is made to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters sought clarification of when SDAs would be required to have complied with the requirement to serve
50-percent youth who are out-of-school. Section 628.803(h)(1) is amended to state that the Governor has the responsibility
to determine the period for which the 50 percent out-of-school requirement will be calculated based either on the
period covered by the job training plan or on a program year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters maintained that the term ``dropout'' needed clarification. ``School dropout'' is defined at section
4(38) of the Act as an individual who is no longer attending any school and who has not received a secondary school diploma
or a certificate from a program of equivalency for such a diploma. That definition is now referenced at &sect;628.804(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were many comments on title II&hyph;C authorized services including limited internships, entry employment
experiences, cooperative education, tryout employment, youth work experience, youth OJT, and others. Most of these
comments indicated confusion and asked for clarification in a variety of ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters wanted limited internships clarified. A few commenters expressed surprise at how open limited internships
were compared to OJT with 100-percent wage reimbursement at a private-for-profit employer and no classroom training
component. A few commenters thought the provision on entry employment experience was poorly written and confusing.
Some wanted clarification on cooperative education. Entry employment experience, cooperative education, and
limited internship offer work-based training experiences in a work setting. The Department believes that the particulars
of how they are designed and carried out should be a matter of State and local policy, so long as they are consistent with
general provisions of the regulations. The Department encourages the development of such work-based training programs
in conjunction with education components that reinforce the experience. The 500-hour limitation on entry employment
experience and limited internship is removed and &sect;628.804(h)(2) of the final rule is amended accordingly.
With regard to cooperative education programs, the Department wishes to emphasize that, as has been the practice,
no subsidized wages may be paid to participants in this activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who sought clarification of what constituted an alternative course of study, the &sect;628.803(h)(2)
includes examples of an alternative school program including an alternative course of study in connection with the
in-school, out-of-school ratio. Section 628.804(b) indicates that the alternative course of study shall be approved
by the local educational authority and may be delivered by a CBO. The Department believes that the JTPA rules should
not specify the characteristics of an alternative course of study when, in almost all instances, this falls within
the responsibility of the local educational authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked whether tryout employment is allowable under title II&hyph;C. Tryout employment previously was
described in section 205 of the Act. If conducted under the provisions of title II&hyph;C, it would be a kind of entry
employment experience. The design of such an activity and the decision to use it is made at the local level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters stressed that youth work experience should not be limited to 500 hours. As previously discussed,
the final rule is revised to clarify that work experience has no duration limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed alarm over the title II&hyph;C OJT requirement that the youth OJT wage equal or exceed
the average wage at placement of title II&hyph;A wage. Commenters stated, in various ways, that the new provisions
on OJT for youth will eliminate youth OJT as a program option and that JTPA will lose its ability to serve this special
needs population. There were several recommendations on how to compute wage. Several wanted the wage to be computed
based totally on youth wages. It is clear that the language at section 264(d)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act intends the youth
OJT wage to be based on the adult wage in title II&hyph;A. Section 628.804(j)(1)(i) is amended to clarify that wages
for OJT positions meet or exceed the average wage at placement in the SDA for participants under title II&hyph;A ``based
on the most recent available data.'' This replaces the language in the interim final rule of ``in the preceding program
year.'' Some may still view these provisions as eliminating private sector work for youth. The Act, however, provides
other opportunities for youth in the private sector, such as entry employment experience, limited internships,
and cooperative education. A few commenters expressed concern that disabled youth will be hurt by the new wage restrictions
for youth OJT. These new training options may be developed with the disabled in mind. These options can be used to provide
sheltered or supported work experiences for disabled youth similar to those available under OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 628.804(k) is amended to clarify that supportive services may be provided after termination. They include
the full range of supportive services defined at section 4(24) of the Act, except for financial assistance, for up
to a year after termination. In the title II&hyph;B section of this Preamble, ``follow-up services'' that would help
bring JTPA closer to the goal of a year round program for youth are discussed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments received by the Department in response to the December 29, 1992, interim final rule specifically
addressed title III issues and concerns. The revisions to the regulations for part 631, Programs under Title III of
the Job Training Partnership Act, were driven by changes to the legislative provisions contained in the Job Training
Amendments of 1992 and the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. Only those comments pertaining to the proposed
regulatory revisions stemming from the legislative changes were considered. After the issuance of the interim final
rule, the enactment of the NAFTA Worker Security Act required additional revisions to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended editorial changes to the proposed regulatory language. These suggestions were
incorporated depending on their accuracy and usefulness. Major comments on the proposed revisions to Part 631, the
Department's analysis of and reaction to those comments, and major changes to the final rule are discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim final rule at &sect;631.2 added an additional definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response
assistance)'', which establishes a minimum threshold for the provision of rapid response assistance. This minimum
threshold cannot be waived, but a new provision, at &sect;631.30(b)(6), which provides the Governor with alternatives
for complying with the threshold and providing rapid response assistance in exceptional circumstances has been
clarified. In addition, that provision has been expanded to reflect a requirement of the NAFTA Worker Security Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned whether the ``employment loss'' in this new definition relates to a single business or
to the geographic area. To maintain consistency with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act,
``employment loss'' in this context relates to a single site of employment . 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the new definition of ``substantial layoff'', another commenter stated that employers periodically
lay off, temporarily, 50 or more employees during a 30-day period and then recall these individuals. Therefore, the
commenter recommends that rapid response assistance should only be authorized if the duration of a layoff is expected
to last for 6 months or more. The Department believes that, after determining a layoff meets the definition of substantial
layoff for rapid response assistance purposes, a State is still required to determine, among other things, the expected
duration of the layoff, the level of need of the affected individuals and their individual eligibility for services.
Ascertaining their need for assistance should include contacting the employer and a representative of the workers.
The State should then decide whether or not to offer services based on these determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters believed the new definition would exclude rapid response assistance for numerous small scale reductions
and stated that, if the definition could not be altered, more latitude should be given to the States under the ``exceptional
circumstances'' provision to respond to smaller layoffs. A commenter suggested expanding ``exceptional circumstances''
to include other situations, and another commenter suggested alternative language for &sect;631.30(b)(6) to allow
the Governor to establish a threshold below 50 for rapid response assistance purposes. Finally, one commenter thought
&sect;631.30(b)(6) directly contradicted the definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response assistance)''
and questioned the legislative basis for this new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a statutory provision, the minimum threshold of 50 employees established by the new definition of substantial
layoff cannot be waived. However, through &sect;631.30(b)(6), the regulations do provide flexibility to States
to establish policies that allow rapid response assistance to be provided to layoffs of less than 50 workers at a single
site. The Governor must establish guidelines defining parameters for ``impact on a local community.'' The only limitation
is that States must maintain a capability to respond to single site layoffs of 50 workers or more. In other words, States
cannot establish policies which would exhaust their ability to provide effective and timely rapid response to layoffs
of at least 50 workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few comments reflected concerns with both definitions of substantial layoff or with having two separate definitions.
One commenter believed the Governor should have the discretion to reduce the worker threshold below 50, while another
believed the definitions must be flexible enough to accommodate local circumstances. A few commenters stated that
having two different definitions was administratively confusing and could lead to disallowed costs as a result of
the difficulty of ascertaining if the 33 percent threshold had been met. To promote consistency, they recommended
using the definition of ``substantial layoff for rapid response purposes'' as the sole definition of the term. Other
commenters believed having two distinct definitions established a possible conflict (i.e., individuals who receive
services through rapid response assistance may not meet the title III eligibility criteria), and indicated that
a single definition of rapid response was preferable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of ``substantial layoff for participant eligibility'' and of ``substantial layoff for rapid response
purposes'' are different as a result of responsive title III policy evolution. Originally, the Department used the
WARN definition of ``mass layoff'' to establish a linkage between title III programs and WARN, and to set forth a minimum
threshold for the provision of State rapid response services. To provide greater flexibility for State rapid response
assistance, Congress provided an additional definition of substantial layoff, but clearly made it exclusively
for rapid response purposes. Therefore, the two definitions of substantial layoff will remain intact.

&sect;631.3(b) for the receipt of selected readjustment and retraining services in instances where an employer
makes a public announcement of a plant closure, pursuant to section 314(h) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked what constitutes a public announcement of a planned closure. One commenter specifically asked
what constitutes a public announcement for the State, and if a WARN notice or a letter to the Governor or locally elected
official from the employer would suffice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.3(b)(4) states that ``the Governor shall establish criteria defining `public announcement'. Such
criteria shall include provisions that the public announcement shall be made by the employer and shall indicate a
planned closure date for the facility (section 314(h) of the Act).'' The Department believes a WARN notice, and most
likely a less formal declaration by an employer, would meet these criteria. However, within the parameters established
in the regulations, the Governor ultimately determines what constitutes a public announcement of a planned closure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters questioned what would happen if a decision to close a plant was changed. A few commenters specifically
asked what would occur if a decision was reversed (e.g., Would the project be canceled? What happens to the workers
who were determined eligible and enrolled? Are they terminated? What impact would a reversal have on cost category
limitation, performance standards and outcomes?). They recommended the institution of a hold harmless provision.
One commenter asked if an individual would remain eligible for retraining should a closure date be delayed or if an
individual in classroom training never received a notice of layoff. Finally, another commenter stated that the participants
should not be denied service or experience an interruption in enrollment due to delays in closing dates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination of EDWAA eligibility for any of the program's services and activities is determined based on the
best information available at the time. If the circumstances upon which the eligibility decision(s) were based change,
a reevaluation of the continued need for the services/activities is appropriate. It is expected that consideration
would be given to such factors as the exact nature of the employer action (postponement or reversal), where the participant
is in the system (e.g., whether the participant is enrolled and participating in a retraining activity), and the impact
of a termination on the individual. However, title III expenditures for services/activities to a participant who
was correctly determined to be eligible are not, in and of themselves, disallowed costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked how States should define ``plant or facility closing'' within the context of &sect;631.3(b). Specifically,
they asked if WARN rules should be used in defining these terms (i.e., whether line closings within a plant or the elimination
of a shift should be considered a plant closing). While the Department believes the WARN rules provide helpful guidance,
this determination is left to the discretion of the Governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requested the addition of language requiring the availability of ``rapid response-like activities''
to a firm entering bankruptcy, whether or not a formal public announcement has been made. Section 631.3(b)(1) provides
for participant eligibility in the event of a formal public announcement of a plant closure. While no change is made
in the final rule, a State may, pursuant to section 314(b) of the Act, provide rapid response assistance after becoming
aware of a current or projected permanent closure or substantial layoff. Moreover, the firm's employees may receive
the services authorized in section 314 of the Act if they meet the eligibility criteria established at section 301.
In assessing the circumstances of an impending bankruptcy, it is expected that the Governor would determine whether
the filing would result in a closing, a layoff, or a Chapter 11 restructuring with no contemplated change in manpower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter questioned whether or not a participant had to be enrolled to receive basic readjustment services and
if limited basic readjustment services could be provided to eligible workers prior to enrollment into a title III
program. Section 314(c) of the Act (Basic Readjustment Services), of course, includes outreach and intake. The Department
believes that outreach and intake services include limited assessment of an eligible applicant to allow service
providers to evaluate an applicant's suitability for JTPA training and services. The definition of ``participant''
at section 4 of the Act provides that: ``Participation shall be deemed to commence on the first day, following determination
of eligibility, on which the participant began receiving subsidized employment, training or other services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters felt that &sect;631.3(b)(3) inappropriately excluded certain groups from consideration as ``eligible
dislocated workers'' pursuant to &sect;631.3(b). A few believed involuntary, forced and early retirements should
be excepted from this provision, since many individuals falling into this category have lost jobs through no fault
of their own. Stating that individuals are often forced or ``seduced'' into early retirement, another commenter
wished to except any individual who is likely to retire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion of individuals ``likely to retire instead of seeking new employment'' is statutorily required at section
314(h)(1) of the Act and, therefore, will remain. The Department interprets the Act to preclude services to those
who are unlikely to need them because they will remain employed with the employer or because they will retire. The decision
about whether any individual who has ``voluntarily'' retired does, in fact, intend to remain unemployed must be made
on a case-by-case basis. This decision is best made at the state or local level. Therefore, the Governor is responsible
for the interpretation of this phrase and its subsequent application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter questioned what was acceptable documentation that a person is ``likely to remain employed with
the employer or to retire'' when no individual notice is provided. It is within the Governor's discretion to determine
what would be acceptable documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;631.3(j) is added to set forth the requirements of section 250(b)(2)(C) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.
2271, et seq.), as amended by the NAFTA Worker Security Act (Title V of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 314(f)(2) of the Act states that eligible individuals participating in title III programs may receive unemployment
compensation benefits consistent with State policies under the Approved Training Rule and defines eligible workers
as those ``participating in training (except on-the-job training).'' The language in the final rule at &sect;631.4
is revised from participation in ``any of the programs'' to ``any retraining activity, except on-the-job training.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter thought that limiting the receipt of unemployment compensation benefits to only those trainees participating
in a retraining activity was inappropriate. Specifically, the commenter believed trainees in a class providing
assessment and the preparation of an individual service strategy (ISS) are not available and looking for work, and
they too need compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objective assessment and preparation of an individual readjustment plan are defined in section 314(c) of the Act
as basic readjustment services and, therefore, individuals participating solely in these activities fail to meet
the criteria established under section 314(f)(2) of the Act and &sect;631.4.

Section 631.13 was not altered in the interim final regulations. However, a few commenters suggested redefining
``retraining'' to be consistent with ``direct training services'' under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and ``basic
readjustment services'' to be consistent with ``training-related services'' under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department acknowledges that statutory requirements often present barriers to coordination, it must
be pointed out that titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and title III authorize separate programs with distinct goals,
structures, services and requirements. For example, objective assessment is defined in titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C
as a direct training service while it is defined in title III as a basic readjustment service. The statute and, in turn,
the regulations reflect this fact. Therefore, the different terms with their distinct definitions remain intact
in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis for computing the cost limitations which apply to expenditures of title III funds has been changed from annual
expenditures to program year allocation (for substate grantees), or to funds reserved by the Governor from the program
year allotment (for States). This change reflects the amendments to section 315 and recognizes that grantees are
permitted to have up to 3 years in which to spend allotted funds, subject to certain adjustments applied through the
reallotment process for under-expenditure. Other major changes to this subject area include the addition of &sect;631.14(i)
to clarify that the funds allocated (or distributed) to a substate grantee under the provisions of section 302(c)(1)(E)
of the Act shall be included in the substate areas formula allocation for purposes of applying the cost limits, and
the addition of &sect;631.14(h) to allow neighboring substate grantees to combine funds to serve dislocated workers
from two or more substate areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked if it is allowable to provide funds to substate grantees under the provisions of section 302(c)(1)(A)&hyph;(D)
of the Act and, if so, whether these funds must be considered funds allocated to a substate grantee for the program year
of the funds' initial allotment to the State and included in the cost limitations of &sect;631.14(a)&hyph;(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While funds reserved by a State for activities under section 302(c)(1)(A)&hyph;(D) of the Act may be expended through
a subgrant or contract with a substate grantee, these funds would still be considered funds allocated to the Governor,
as defined at &sect;631.14(i)(3), for the program year of the funds' initial allotment to the State and included in
the cost limitations applicable to the Governor. As the statute allocates these funds to the Governor for the explicit
purpose of carrying out responsibilities assigned to the State, expenditures of these funds are to be treated as State-level
expenditures, regardless of the operator incurring those expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked whether TEGL No. 1&hyph;90, Change 1, which specified that cost limitations would be calculated
based on ``total maximum allowable expenditures'', would remain in effect after July 1, 1993 and if new guidelines
would be issued for calculating/determining title III cost limitation compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TEGL 1&hyph;90, Change 1 was issued on June 18, 1991, and its content was based on the statutory and regulatory provisions
effective at that time. The Department will review this TEGL and issue appropriate guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter also asked if the minimum/maximum percentage requirements would be applied to the total final
expenditures for each cost category to determine the minimum/maximum amounts after July 1, 1993. In a separate issuance,
the Department will issue reporting requirements which will clarify the application of the cost limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter discussed the inconsistency between the 15 percent cap on administrative costs under the title III
program and the 20 percent cap on administrative costs under the title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, section 108 of the Act established a revised limit of 20 percent of funds that may
be expended for administration. However, as noted above, while the basis for computing the cost limitations which
apply to expenditures of title III funds has changed, the statutory provision requiring a 15 percent cap on administrative
cost has not. Therefore, this difference between the programs shall remain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questioning the application of &sect;631.14(g), one commenter asked if cost limitations must be complied with immediately
if funds are deobligated and, therefore, are no longer available. Cost limitations are applied at the time funds are
no longer available for expenditure, in other words, when the 3-year availability period ends. When funds are deobligated,
the total pool of funds which is available for expenditure is reduced and becomes the new base on which cost limitations
will be applied. However, a State or substate grantee still has the entire period of fund availability to comply with
the cost limitations as they apply to this new base.

Federal Reporting Requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new provision was added in the interim final regulations, at &sect;631.15, requiring the State to provide a breakdown
of all administrative expenditures by the dislocated worker unit, pursuant to section 311(b)(11) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters asked what cost breakdowns and line items are required in the reports. As indicated in &sect;631.15,
the specifics regarding the reports' content and format will be addressed through instructions to be issued by the
Secretary. These were included in the reporting instructions for title III programs for PY 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new provision is added, at &sect;631.17, clarifying the Secretary's authority to oversee the State's provision
of rapid response assistance and to require corrective action as necessary, as provided for in section 314(b)(3)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned why the word ``may'' was used in &sect;631.17 in lieu of the word ``shall'' which is found
in the language of section 314(b)(3) of the Act. This section is revised to reflect the language of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prescribing how rapid response is to occur, another commenter thought this new provision, along with other sections
of the regulations, resulted in ``micro-management by the Department'' and reduced the flexibility available to
the States and local areas. The Amendments direct the Secretary to conduct oversight of rapid response to ensure the
``effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness'' of these actions. It remains the responsibility of the State to manage
its program in accordance with the Act and the regulations.

Needs-Related Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An amended provision in section 314(e)(1) regarding eligibility for needs-related payments requires that a participant
be unemployed, and this requirement is incorporated in &sect;631.20(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter disapproved of the change since it denies needs-related payments to participants working any number
of hours. This commenter indicated that not only were they able to keep the costs of these payments down by having participants
work part-time, but full-time students could work part-time and have these earnings supplemented by the payments
to allow them to complete their program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, section 314(e)(1) of the Act clearly states that a participant must be unemployed to receive needs-related
payments. As a result, the final rule remains unchanged.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A provision at &sect;631.30(a)(8) requires the State to immediately (within 48 hours) notify the substate grantee
of current or projected layoffs and closures in the local area for the purpose of continuing and expanding upon the
services initiated by the rapid response team, as required in section 311(b)(3)(D) of the Act. Moreover, section
311(b)(12) of the Act stipulates that accountability for rapid response assistance resides in the dislocated worker
unit (DWU), although the DWU may contract with other entities for the provision of these services. This is reflected
in the provisions at &sect;631.30(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned whether 48 hours meant 48 working hours and what would happen if the information was made
available on a Friday afternoon. The Department believes the Governor is responsible for the interpretation and
application of the term ``48 hours.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter indicated stronger language needed to be incorporated into the regulations to ensure that the
State did not pass off its rapid response responsibilities to the substate grantees. After reviewing &sect;631.30(b),
the Department feels the language adequately addresses this concern. The regulatory provision remains unchanged.

Allocation of Funds by the Governor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Interim Final Regulations, a provision was added to &sect;631.32(b)(2) to clarify that Governors must give
consideration to each of the substate allocation formula factors required by section 302(d) of the Act unless the
factor is not relevant to economic dislocation conditions of the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters had questions regarding the formula for making substate allocations. One commenter indicated that
&sect;631.32(b)(3) should also allow a zero weight factor to be used where data are not adequate or not provided or
funded by a Federal partner. Specifically, they mentioned that plant closing and mass layoff data are no longer funded
and farmer-rancher economic hardship data have never been provided by the Department and the USDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mass Layoff Statistics program was temporarily suspended by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Department intends
to resume the Mass Layoff Statistics Program early in 1995. During the interim period, however, States will have to
develop their own data and proxies for mass layoffs. Similarly, States have been responsible for developing their
own data and proxies for farmer-rancher economic hardship data. It is inconceivable that a State government would
have no idea as to economic circumstances in its own State. If ``a review of the available data indicates that the factor
is not relevant to determining the incidence of need for worker dislocation assistance within the State'', then a
zero weight may be assigned (&sect;631.32(b)(3)). However, current lack of data is not an adequate reason for invalidating
a factor which is relevant to dislocation activity in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter wondered if the Governor had an obligation beyond the requirements of &sect;627.463 (public access
to records) to publicize the elements of the formula or describe the rationales for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department requires each State Plan to include a description of the State's substate allocation formula methodology,
including the data elements and allocation formula to be used. Moreover, pursuant to section 311(b)(9) of the Act,
the Plan must be made available to the State job training coordinating council to review and comment on prior to its
submittal to the Department. Therefore, through this process, both the State Council and the Department will have
an opportunity to examine the within-State distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While no significant revisions were made to &sect;631.50 of the regulations, one commenter stated that the interim
final rule omits any requirement for SSG's to meet program goals, develop an oversight plan and build capacity and
noted that comparable provisions for SDA's are at &sect;628.420(b)(2), (3) and (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, the proposed revisions to the regulations for part 631 were driven by changes to the legislative
provisions contained in the Job Training Amendments of 1992 and the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993.
The Department has chosen not to regulate in areas unaffected by statutory change. Only those comments pertaining
to the proposed regulatory revisions stemming from the legislative changes were considered for incorporation into
the final rule. Therefore, &sect;631.50 remains unchanged.

Cost Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 631.62 of the interim final rule stipulated that the cost limitations under part A of title III will apply to
projects operated under part B of title III, except when waived or altered by the application guidelines, or by the
Grant Officer in the terms of the grant. In response to comments, the Department has modified this provision in the
final rule. The Department still intends to use the title III&hyph;A cost limitations in cases where applicants for
grants do not ask for a different allocation of costs among the cost categories, but the Department does not wish to
discourage applicants from designing their programs in the manner that will best serve the affected population.
The final rule is revised to make it clear that applicants for grants can propose costs and that the Grant Officer has
the discretion to accept them. It is the Department's intent to provide grant applicants flexibility in designing
the mix of services in their programs. However, the Department will agree to proposals with administrative cost in
excess of 15% only in extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked if this provision will apply to the Defense Conversion Adjustment (DCA) Program projects currently
in operation or whether these projects will continue to operate under the regulations in effect at the time of award.
Each discretionary project is subject to the grant agreement and modifications as approved by the Grant Officer.
Modifications to an existing grant may be requested by the grantee and agreed to by the Grant Officer according to the
provisions of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, three commenters discussed the difficulty of applying the Act's section 315 cost limitations to Clean Air
Employment Transition Assistance projects. As stated above, the cost limitations in the grant agreement control,
however, modifications to existing grants may be requested. For future grants, applicants are free to apply for other
cost limits that fit their programs.

One commenter thought the process for notifying the Secretary regarding significant developments concerning the
grant or subgrant was too complicated and could delay the implementation of the project and workers' access to services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.63(b) simply requires the grantees to provide information to the Department on any significant developments
that impact the project. This reporting requirement should not affect or delay the project's execution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 631.60 has been clarified to state that Subpart G relates to programs and funds reserved to the Secretary for
use under part B of title III of the Act: Including section 323 (20% discretionary funds); section 324 (Demonstration
Programs); section 325 (Defense Conversion Adjustment Program); section 325A (Defense Diversification Program);
and section 326 (Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Defense Authorization Act for 1993 authorized the Defense Diversification Program (DDP) as an amendment
to JTPA, at section 325A. Its purpose is to provide retraining and readjustment assistance to workers and military
personnel dislocated by defense cutbacks and closures of military facilities; and to provide planning support and
conversion assistance for diversification of affected facilities within an area impacted by reductions in military
expenditures or closure of military facilities. Section 631.65(c) of this final rule prescribes the needs-related
payments procedure in accordance with the requirements in section 326(f) of the Act, as required by section 325A(i)
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency; however, the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, at section 110(a), amended the Job Training Partnership Act by adding a new section 326,
establishing the Clean Air Employment Transition Assistance (CAETA) program. Section 326 is designed to assure
the establishment of programs to provide assistance to workers dislocated as a result of a firm's compliance with
the Clean Air Act. The purpose of these programs is to provide readjustment and retraining assistance to eligible
workers to enable such workers to return to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department published proposed CAETA regulations for comment on March 24, 1992 (57 FR 10232). Thirteen State,
substate entities and other organizations submitted comments. Upon review, the Department has determined that
there is no programmatic justification to have separate regulations for Clean Air. It is necessary, however, to make
specific provision in the JTPA regulations for specific statutory requirements applicable to the CAETA program.
The specific statutory requirements for that program are implemented herein at &sect;631.65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comments received pursuant to the proposed regulations requested clarification of general JTPA title
III areas that were subsequently addressed in the Interim Final Regulations on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 62004). The
following discussion relates to comments on issues specific to the Clean Air Act.

Agency. DOL agrees with this comment and has added this statement in the preamble.

Needs-Related Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received on the provisions of needs-related payments. One commenter indicated that the language
in the proposed regulations might discourage grant applicants from serving those eligible for payments so they can
conserve funds for training, and that applicants could perceive ETA as biased toward proposed grants with limited
needs-related payments (NRP's). It was also believed that grant applicants should be encouraged to seek eligible
dislocated workers most-in-need, particularly those requiring income support during training. The language at
&sect;631.65(c) of the final rule is intended to reflect the statutory requirement that CAETA programs provide for
adequate needs-related payments. The language is not intended to permit a programmatic restriction against those
dislocated workers who are eligible to receive NRP's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter raised a question about when grantees should start using family income to determine eligibility
for needs-related payments. The Department agrees that there should be a time frame; it is only upon actual enrollment
in a training and/or education program that one becomes eligible for consideration to receive needs-related payments.
Individual or family income for the six-month period immediately prior to a participant's enrollment in training
and education programs is to be annualized to determine eligibility for needs-related payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the determination of family income at the time of eligibility determination, and that the
three-month re-determination requirement in the proposed rule would create administrative burdens. The determination
of family income only applies to those dislocated workers who (1) have been determined eligible pursuant to section
326(a) of the Act, (2) have exhausted or are not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, and (3) have been
enrolled in training and education programs pursuant to section 326(f) of the Act. Section 326(f)(4) of the Act requires
adjustments reflecting changes in family income. The final rule is revised to require that eligibility determinations
``shall be reviewed periodically;'' however, it is expected that an equitable system would be outlined in a grant
application. It is expected that a grantee's system would be sensitive to participants' probable decreasing family
income (depending upon the date of layoff) under the six-month income determination rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested clarifying restrictions on needs-related payments to participants when relocation,
out-of-area job search, or TAA allowances have ceased, or when OJT has been completed. The statute requires that needs-related
payments be available to enable participants to complete training or education programs. Relocation and out-of-area
job search allowances would normally be provided to participants who possess marketable skills, and, therefore,
are not enrolled in training or education. If TAA allowances were being provided for training or education, needs-related
payments may be used when TAA allowances are exhausted (if a participant is otherwise eligible for and enrolled in
an education or training program under CAETA). After OJT, a participant ordinarily is employed and receives wages
from the employer. If the participant is not employed, NRP's could only be made if the participant is enrolled in other
training.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters asked what constitutes ``satisfactory progress'' in order for a participant to continue to receive
NRP's, and how often this determination must be made. The Department expects a grant application to define a system
to address this issue, based upon the training to be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter believed that the wording in the proposed rule, that grantees must provide needs-related payments, seemed
less definitive and suggested stating whether the projects will be funded without providing for payments to any participant.
Another commenter suggested having States check the needs-related payment policies of SDA's before initiating
the needs-related payments requirement. Two commenters suggested using the same eligibility criteria for needs-related
payments for CAETA as are used in other title III programs. Two commenters suggested allowing State or local flexibility
in determining who receives payments and payments policy. Another commenter suggested that it would be confusing
to make the needs-related payment rate applicable to the weekly unemployment compensation payment level or to the
poverty level, which the commenter believed would limit the number of eligible individuals in classroom training.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is unable to accede to the requests of these commenters. Needs-related payments are discretionary
under title III of JTPA, and grantees have some flexibility in providing such payments. However, under section 326(c)(2)
of the Act, CAETA funds must be used to provide needs-related payments in accordance with the requirements set forth
at section 326(f) of the Act. Similarly, section 325A(i) of the Act provides that in DDP programs, needs-related payments
must be made in accordance with section 326(f). The Act requires that the Secretary prescribe regulations with respect
to needs-related payments for CAETA and DDP. The needs-related payments regulations at &sect;631.65(c) follow
the statutory requirements at section 326(f) of the Act. Because of these statutory requirements of CAETA and DDP,
grantees have little discretion and must provide needs-related payments in the manner set forth in &sect;631.65(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested developing regulations that require grantees to document reasons for denial of payments
and give opportunities for participants who had payments suspended to seek redress up to and including the federal
level. The Department agrees that grantees should include descriptions of systems in grant applications which document
payments, reasons for denial of payments and suspensions. In addition, the regulations at &sect;631.64 require
each grantee to establish and to maintain a grievance procedure which, among other things, would handle grievances
related to needs-related payments. The regulations at subpart F of 20 CFR part 627 provide procedures for the federal
handling of allegations of violations of the Act or regulations.

Participant Eligibility

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine commenters raised questions regarding participant eligibility provisions for dislocated workers under CAETA.
One commenter suggested expanding the eligible population to workers needing skills upgrading or retraining on
new or modified equipment. Sections 301 and 326(a) of the Act establish eligibility criteria for CAETA. Dislocated
workers may receive skills training in the same occupation in which they were previously employed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 their current skills are obsolete, and such training is required for them to meet the local labor market hiring requirements
for that occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested including a statement regarding the eligibility of workers who had been laid off from mines
that supply coal to plants. The Department agrees that workers dislocated from mines as a result of compliance with
the Clean Air Act would be eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter raised the question of how one determines that an individual's dislocation is the consequence
of compliance with the Act if the layoff notice does not specifically mention the impact of the Clean Air Act, and whether
the grantee has to assure verification is done for each applicant. The CAETA grantee must determine and document that
a layoff is Clean Air Act-related and must verify that each applicant was a part of such layoff. The application guidelines
will provide for reasonable documentation which could establish that the layoff was related to the Clean Air Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested allowing temporary employment with the employer from which the worker was dislocated.
Participant eligibility for enrollment in CAETA is specified at section 326(a) of the Act. The Department believes
that temporary employment with the same employer is inconsistent with the definition of dislocation and is restricted

The Department received seven comments regarding entities eligible to apply for grants under CAETA. Three commenters
indicated that submitting applications directly to the Department of Labor, rather than through the State, could
lead to such problems as a lack of coordination, and duplication. Another commenter suggested that recipients should
provide assurances that they are administratively capable of operating the program. Two commenters suggested that
limiting eligible grantees to States and territories of the United States would ensure coordination with State entities
and SSGs. Section 326(b) of the Act permits the Secretary to recognize five types of eligible grantees, and it does
not require applicants to apply through the State. The Department recognizes that there would be benefits to submitting
all applications through the States, and encourages such action. It should be noted, however, that an ``eligible
grantee'' may not be an appropriate applicant for a particular project. The nature and extent of the proposed project,
and the capacity of an applicant, will be factors in evaluating an application and an applicant's ability to perform
the work.

Subpart I_Disaster Relief Employment Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new Subpart I, to be administered under the title III National Reserve Grants program, provides for Disaster Relief
Employment Assistance, as authorized by the new Amendments to title IV&hyph;J of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.84(a) discusses the projects that a unit of general local government in a disaster area may operate under
this subpart. One commenter suggested substituting the phrase, ``Davis-Bacon provisions shall apply on all projects
related to demolition, cleanup, repair *&blank;*&blank;*'' for ``on projects regarding demolition, cleanup,
repair *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Davis-Bacon does apply to Federal programs, the inclusion of this phrase does not change or clarify the meaning
of this provision. Therefore, the section will remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.85 outlines the participant eligibility criteria under the Disaster Relief Employment Assistance
Program. The statutory language regarding eligibility is not accurately reflected in this section. The final rule
is revised to correct this problem. In addition, one commenter thought the Department should have the authority to
declare persons who are eligible for titles II-A and II-C programs eligible for title III Disaster Relief Programs.
Since the statute does not grant the Department this blanket authority, expansion of participant eligibility criteria
will not occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 631.86 limits the length of disaster relief employment. One commenter questioned the difference between
this type of employment and public service employment which is prohibited under titles II and III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the statute prohibits public service employment funded under title II&hyph;A and C and title III&hyph;A,
public service employment is contemplated under title IV-J of the Act. Disaster relief employment is narrowly defined
and exclusively limited to the activities described under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;631.84. Allowable activities will not be expanded beyond the statutorily established parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter asked how costs incurred for disaster relief employment should be classified and what criteria
should be used in determining the monetary extent to which a cost category has benefited. The Department has chosen
not to issue detailed regulations for this program. Specific information regarding Disaster Relief Employment
Assistance projects, including any guidance on cost classification issues, will be contained in application guidelines
published by the Secretary. Until they are issued, an applicant for these funds should follow the guidelines and information
published in the July 9, 1992

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters addressed this section of the interim final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the comments addressed inconsistencies in the numbering of the sections and in the cross-references.
The part has been revised to correct the numbering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several of the commenters raised questions concerning how the program can be implemented in the absence
of any Congressional appropriation. While bonuses will not be awarded under title V of the Act until funds are appropriated
by Congress, individuals who are eligible to be counted for title V purposes may be served under other titles of the
Act. Since those individuals who would be eligible to be counted for the incentive bonuses under title V must also be
eligible for, and have participated in, other activities under the Act, the costs associated with their participation
in these activities would be charged to the appropriate program(s) and title(s) of the Act. If a State wishes to participate
in the title V bonus program, if it is ever funded, the State may wish to keep track of the outcomes of training for individuals
eligible to be counted for bonus purposes.

Effective Date

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that the regulations are being issued after the beginning of a program year. To avoid administrative
difficulties, the Department has made the effective date of the regulations June 30, 1995, the beginning of Program
Year 1995. This will give states and SDA's/SSG's time to plan for the changes that may result from the amendments made
in this final rule. States or SDA's/SSG's are, of course, free to implement any of the changes that they find will benefit
their programs earlier than the effective date and the Department will treat those changes as legally effective when
adopted in any subsequent monitoring or audit resolution activity. Consistent with the Department's desire to enable
states and SDAs to implement the beneficial changes in the final rule as quickly as they choose, the provisions of &sect;627.210,
authorizing the Department to grant waivers of regulatory requirements are made effective within 30 days of publication
to enable states to apply for waivers to be effective before the beginning of PY 1995.

It is the purpose of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA or the Act) to establish programs to prepare youth and adults
facing serious barriers to employment for participation in the labor force by providing job training and other services
that will result in increased employment and earnings, increased educational and occupational skills, and decreased
welfare dependency, thereby improving the quality of the work force and enhancing the productivity and competitiveness
of the Nation (section 2).

the educational institution's financial aid officer to inform the SDA's/SSG's of the amounts and disposition of
any HEA, title IV awards and other types of financial aid to each JTPA participant awarded after the enrollment of the
participant, as part of a continuing, regular information sharing process (section 141(b)).

General_(1) On-the-job training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (OJT) means training by an employer in the private or public sector given to a participant who, after objective assessment,
and in accordance with the ISS, has been referred to and hired by the employer following the development of an agreement
with the employer to provide occupational training in exchange for reimbursement of the employer's extraordinary
costs. On-the-job training occurs while the participant is engaged in productive work which provides knowledge
and skills essential to the full and adequate performance of the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) This does not preclude a participant who has been trained by one employer from ultimately being placed in a comparable
training-related position with another employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On-the-job training may be sequenced with or accompanied by other types of training such as classroom training
or literacy training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duration of OJT.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) OJT authorized for a participant shall be limited to a period not in excess of that required for the participant
to acquire the skills needed for the OJT position. Except as described in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, the period
of reimbursement to the employer under an OJT agreement shall not exceed 6 months of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 6-month duration of OJT may be expressed as a number of hours, days, or weeks the participant is expected to work
in a 6-month period if the participant works full-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the event that a participant's regular employment is less than full-time and less than 500 hours of OJT has occurred
by the end of 6 months, that participant may remain in OJT until 499 hours OJT hours have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) Recipients shall develop policies and procedures for determining the average training duration for occupations
including to reflect an individual participant's need for additional training time, or reduction in training time
to reflect the individual participant's partial acquisition of needed skills. (In no case should an individual who
is fully skilled in an occupation be placed in OJT in that occupation.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In determining the average training time, consideration should be given to recognized reference materials,
such as the ``Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (DOT) and employer training plans. Such materials need not be limited
to the DOT, however. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On-the-job training is encouraged, but not required, in all occupations with significant training content,
particularly in higher-skill occupations appropriate to the participant's needs. Training plans may be developed
that recognize the full duration of the OJT period necessary for the full and adequate performance of the job, but the
period of reimbursement may not exceed the duration in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When the OJT period in a given occupation for a participant for whom the ISS identifies OJT as appropriate varies
from the average for that occupation, the basis for the variation shall be recorded in the ISS.

On-the-job training payments to employers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) On-the-job training payments to employers are deemed to be in compensation for the extraordinary costs associated
with training participants and in compensation for the costs associated with the lower productivity of such participants.
Employers shall not be required to document such extraordinary costs or lower productivity (section 141(g)(1)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) On-the-job training payments to employers shall not, during the period of such training, average more than
50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to OJT participants.

(ii) On-the-job training payments to employers may be based upon scheduled raises or regular pay increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

wages paid by the employer to participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) On-the-job training payments may not be based upon periods of time such as illness, holidays, plant downtime
or other events in which no training occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Employers which provide classroom or vestibule training to meet the specific training needs of JTPA participants
to equip them with education and knowledge necessary to the OJT occupation may be separately reimbursed for training
costs, such as instructors and training material.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OJT participants shall be compensated by the employer at the same rates, including periodic increases, as similarly
situated employees, but in no event less than the higher of the minimum wage specified under the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938, as amended or the applicable State or local minimum wage. Participants must receive the same benefits
and have the same working conditions as similarly situated employees.

(1) Only those participants who have been assessed and for whom OJT has been determined as an appropriate activity
in the participant's ISS may be referred to an employer for participation in OJT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An individual referred to the JTPA program by an employer may be enrolled in an OJT program with such employer only
upon completion of the objective assessment and individual service strategy in which OJT with such employer has been
determined to be an appropriate activity and only if the employer has not already hired such individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) OJT with the participant's previous or current employer in the same, a similar, or an upgraded job is not permitted.

and that the training is being provided as specified in the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Brokering contractors shall conduct on-site monitoring of the OJT employers and other subcontractors to verify
compliance with subcontract terms before making payments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) OJT agreements shall not be entered into with employers which, under previous agreements, have exhibited a pattern
of failing to provide OJT participants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages, benefits
and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as similarly situated employees. This prohibition
does not apply to OJT agreements for youth in the program under title II&hyph;B who are returning to school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Governors shall issue procedures and criteria to implement the requirement in paragraph (h)(1) of this section,
which shall specify the duration of the period of loss of eligibility. The procedures and criteria shall provide that
situations in which OJT participants quit voluntarily, are terminated for cause, or are released due to unforeseeable
changes in business conditions will not necessarily result in termination of employer eligibility.

(a) In the development and conduct of programs funded under the Act, SDA's and SSG's shall ensure that participants
are not assigned to work for employers which do not comply with applicable labor laws, including wage and hour, occupational
health and safety, and child labor laws (29 CFR part 570). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To the extent that a State workers' compensation law is applicable, workers' compensation benefits in accordance
with such law shall be available with respect to injuries suffered by participants. Where a State's workers' compensation
law is not applicable, recipients and subrecipients shall secure insurance coverage for injuries suffered by such
participants in all JTPA work-related activities. Income maintenance coverage (e.g., contributions for unemployment
compensation), is not required for participants (section 143(a)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where a participant is engaged in activities not covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,
as amended, the participant shall not be required or permitted to work, be trained, or receive services in buildings
or surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the participant's
health or safety. A participant employed or trained for inherently dangerous occupations, e.g., fire or police jobs,
shall be assigned to work in accordance with reasonable safety practices (section 143(a)(2)).

Competition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each State and subrecipient shall conduct procurements in a manner which provides full and open competition.
Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms or organizations in order for them to qualify to do business; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Organizational conflicts of interest; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing ``an equal'' product to be offered and describing
the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Overly restrictive specifications; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each State and subrecipient shall have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures shall
ensure that all solicitations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service
to be procured (including quantities). Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features
which unduly restrict competition; and

or proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PIC conflict of interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) A PIC member shall not cast a vote, nor participate in any decisionmaking capacity, on the provision of services
by such member (or any organization which that member directly represents), nor on any matter which would provide
any direct financial benefit to that member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Neither membership on the PIC nor the receipt of JTPA funds to provide training and related services shall be construed,
by itself, to violate provisions of section 141(f) of the Act or &sect;627.420. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A conflict of interest under paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section would arise when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The individual, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any member of the individual's immediate family, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The individual's partner, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the
firm or organization selected for award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The officers, employees, or agents of the agency and PIC members making the award will neither solicit nor accept
gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from awardees, potential awardees, or parties to subagreements.
States and subrecipients may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited
item of nominal intrinsic value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods of procurement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each State and subrecipient shall use one of the following methods of procurement, as appropriate for each procurement
action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Small purchase procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more
than $25,000 in the aggregate. Recipients and subrecipients shall not break down one purchase into several purchases
merely to be able to use small purchase procedures. The Governor shall establish standards for small purchase procedures
to ensure that price or rate quotations will be documented from an adequate number of qualified sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sealed bids (formal advertising)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_bids are publicly solicited procurements for which a firm-fixed-price award (lump sum or unit price) or other fixed-price
arrangement is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions
of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The Governor shall establish standards for sealed bids which include
requirements that invitations for bids be publicly advertised, and that bids be solicited from an adequate number
of organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Competitive proposals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement
type award is made. The Governor shall establish standards for competitive proposals which include requirements
for the establishment of a documented methodology for technical evaluations and award to the responsible offeror
whose proposals are most advantageous to the program with price, technical, and other factors considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Noncompetitive proposals (sole source)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, the funding of an unsolicited proposal, or
when, after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. Each State and subrecipient
shall minimize the use of sole source procurements to the extent practicable, but in every case the use of sole source
procurements shall be justified and documented. On-the-job training (OJT) awards (except OJT brokering awards,
which shall be selected competitively) and the enrollment of individual participants in classroom training may
be sole sourced. For all other awards, procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award is infeasible
under small purchase procedures, sealed bids, or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The item or service is available only from a single source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The public exigency or emergency need for the item or service does not permit a delay resulting from competitive
solicitation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) For SDAs, SSGs and subrecipients, the awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; for States, the
noncompetitive proposal is approved through the State's normal sole source approval process; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass Throughs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The procurement rules do not apply to pass throughs of monies from any unit of State or local government (or SDA or SSG
administrative entities) to other such units, such as a local educational agency or public housing authority. To
qualify as a pass through, the receiving entity must either further pass through the monies to another such entity
or procure services in accordance with the procurement rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost or price analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each recipient, in accordance with the minimum requirements established in this section, shall establish standards
on the performance of cost or price analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each recipient and subrecipient shall perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action,
including modifications (except for modifications where a determination has been made that they do not have a monetary
impact). The method and degree of analysis depends on the facts surrounding the particular procurement and pricing
situation. At a minimum, the awarding agency shall make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.
A cost analysis is necessary when the offeror is required to submit the elements of the estimated cost (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as in the case of subrecipient relationships), when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements,
including modifications or change orders. A price analysis shall be used when price reasonableness can be established
on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public
or based on prices set by law or regulation (including situations involving inadequate price competition and sole
source procurements where a price analysis may be used in lieu of a cost analysis). When a cost analysis is necessary
and there is inadequate price competition, the offeror shall certify that to the best of its knowledge and belief,
the cost data are accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price. Awards or modifications negotiated
in reliance on such data should provide the awarding agency a right to a price adjustment to exclude any significant
sum by which the price was increased because the awardee had knowingly submitted data that were not accurate, complete,
or current as certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) JTPA procurements shall not permit excess program income (for nonprofit and governmental entities) or excess
profit (for private for-profit entities). If profit or program income is included in the price, the awarding agency
shall negotiate profit or program income as a separate element of the price for each procurement in which there is no
price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit or program
income, consideration shall be given to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The complexity of the work to be performed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The risk borne by the awardee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The offeror's investment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The amount of subcontracting/subgranting; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The quality of the offeror's record of past performance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Market conditions in the surrounding geographical area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Each recipient and subrecipient may charge to the agreement only those costs which are consistent with the allowable
cost provisions of &sect;627.435 of this part, including the guidelines issued by the Governor, as required at &sect;627.435(i)
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The cost plus a percentage of cost method shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oversight
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Each recipient and subrecipient shall conduct and document oversight to ensure compliance with the procurement
standards, in accordance with the requirements of &sect;627.475 of this part, Oversight and monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each recipient and subrecipient shall maintain an administration system which ensures that vendors and subrecipients
perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transactions between units of government
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, procurement transactions between units of State or local
governments, or any other entities organized principally as the administrative entity for service delivery areas
or substate areas, shall be conducted on a cost reimbursable basis. Cost plus type awards are not allowable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of procurement transactions with schools that are a part of these entities, such as State universities
and secondary schools, when tuition charges or entrance fees are not more than the educational institution's catalogue
price, necessary to receive specific training, charged to the general public to receive the same training, and for
training of participants, the tuition and/ or entrance fee does not have to be broken out by items of cost.

(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disputes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The Governor shall ensure that the recipient and each subrecipient have protest procedures to handle and resolve
disputes relating to their procurements. A protester shall exhaust all administrative remedies with the subrecipient
before pursuing a protest at a higher level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Violations of law will be handled in accordance with the requirements contained in &sect;627.500(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Each recipient and subrecipient shall maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement.

of this part, Procurement, and section 164(a)(3) of the Act. The standards shall require that determinations of demonstrated
performance will be in writing, and completed prior to the award of an agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each recipient and subrecipient, to the extent practicable, shall select service providers on a competitive
basis, in accordance with the standards established in &sect;627.420(b) of this part, Procurement. When a State,
SDA, SSG, or administrative entity determines that services other than intake and eligibility determination will

Basic standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, each recipient and subrecipient shall be paid in advance,

Working capital advance payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a subrecipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (b) of this section, and the
awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the subrecipient lacks sufficient working
capital, the awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance payment basis. Under this procedure, the
awarding agency shall advance cash to the subrecipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period,
generally geared to the subrecipient's disbursing cycle. In no event may such an advance exceed 20 percent of the award
amount. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the subrecipient for its actual cash disbursements. The
working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by recipients or subrecipients if the reason for using
such method is the unwillingness or inability of the recipient or subrecipient to provide timely advances to the subrecipient
to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) A waiver of the recipient's liability can only be considered by the Grant Officer when the misexpenditure of JTPA
funds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Occurred at a subrecipient level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Was not a violation of section 164(e)(1) of the Act, or did not constitute fraud; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If fraud did exist, it was perpetrated against the recipient/subrecipient; and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The recipient/subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and prosecuted the perpetrator of said fraud;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) After aggressive debt collection action, it can be documented that there is no likelihood of collection from
the perpetrator of the fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The recipient has issued a final determination which disallows the misexpenditure, the recipient's appeal process
has been exhausted, and a debt has been established; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The recipient requests such a waiver and provides documentation to demonstrate that it has substantially complied
with the requirements of section 164(e)(2)(A), (B), (C), and (D) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The recipient shall not be released from liability for misspent funds under the determination required by section
164(e) of the Act unless the Grant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the recipient or subrecipient,
would be inappropriate or would prove futile.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The recipient may request advance approval from the Grant Officer for contemplated corrective actions, including
debt collection actions, which the recipient plans to initiate or to forego. The recipient's request shall include
a description and an assessment of all actions taken by the subrecipient to collect the misspent funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may determine that the recipient may forego certain collection
actions against a subrecipient where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The subrecipient was not at fault with respect to the liability criteria set forth in section 164(e)(2)(A), (B),
(C), and (D) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The misexpenditure of funds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that received JTPA funds from that subrecipient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Was not a violation of section 164(e)(1) of the Act, or did not constitute fraud; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If fraud did exist, it was perpetrated against the subrecipient, and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and prosecuted the perpetrator of said fraud; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) After aggressive debt collection action, it can be documented that there is no likelihood of collection from the
perpetrator of the fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A final determination which disallows the misexpenditure and establishes a debt has been issued at the appropriate
level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Final action within the recipient's appeal system has been completed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Further debt collection action by that subrecipient or the recipient would be either inappropriate or futile.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A recipient may request that a debt, or a portion thereof, be offset against amounts allotted to the recipient,
and retained at the recipient level for administrative costs, under the current or a future JTPA entitlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For title II grants, any offset shall be applied against the recipient level 5 percent administrative cost set-aside
only and may not be distributed by the recipient among its subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For title III grants, any such offset must be applied against that portion of funds reserved by the recipient for
recipient level administration only and may not be distributed by the recipient among its subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Grant Officer may approve an offset request, under section 164(d) of the Act, if the misexpenditures were not
in violation of section 164(e)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If offset is granted, the debt shall not be fully satisfied until the Grant Officer reduces amounts allotted to
the State by the amount of the misexpenditure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The recipient shall not have the authority to reduce allocations to an SDA or SSG for misexpenditure of JTPA funds

Cost categories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Cost categories applicable to PY 1992 and earlier funds will be subject to prior regulations either until the funds
have been exhausted or program activity has been completed. In order to assist the orderly transition to and implementation
of the new requirements of the 1992 JTPA amendments, an increase is allowed in the administrative cost limitation
for PY 1992 funds from 15 percent to 20 percent, with a corresponding adjustment to cost limitations for training and
participant support. Specifically, not less than 80 percent of the title II&hyph;A funds shall be expended for training
and participant support, and not less than 65 percent shall be expended for training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any prior year's carryover funds made available for use in PY 1993 will be subject to the reporting requirements
and cost categories applicable to PY 1993 funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining compliance with the JTPA cost limitations for PY 1992, Governors may either:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine cost limitation compliance separately for funds expended in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and
(g)(2) of this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determine compliance for each cost category against the total PY 1992 funds, whether expended in accordance
with the Act and regulations in effect prior to the 1992 amendments to JTPA or in accordance with the amended Act and
these regulations. Using this option, the total combined funds expended for training and direct training should
be at least 65 percent of PY 1992 SDA allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In addition to the institutions specified in &sect;627.440(d)(1)(vi)(B), the costs of tuition and entrance
fees of a postsecondary vocational institution specified at section 481(c) of the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C.
1088(c)) may be charged to direct training services through June 30, 1995, when such tuition charges or entrance fees
are not more than the educational institution's catalog price, are necessary to receive specific training, are charged
to the general public to receive such training, and are for the training of participants.

Program implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The implementation by the States and SDA's of certain new program design requirements, particularly objective assessment
and development of individual service strategies (ISS), may require additional time to fully implement beyond July
1, 1993. Reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of &sect;&sect;628.515, 628.520, and 628.530. as soon as
possible after July 1, 1993, are expected to be made. However, it is not expected that every new participant will initially
receive objective assessment, ISS, and referral to non-title II services for a period of 6 months, or until January
1, 1994.

 The 50-percent out-of-school participants requirement for title II&hyph;C will be phased in during PY 1993 and will
not be the subject of compliance review until PY 1994, beginning July 1, 1994. During PY 1993, however, SDA's must show
significant improvement in the proportion of out-of-school youth being served and performance in increasing the
service ratio will be monitored by the States and DOL during this implementation period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the designation cannot be made for an off-year in this cycle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Each request for designation as an SDA shall be submitted in a form and by a date established by the Governor. The
procedures established by the Governor shall provide for the treatment of existing SDA's for the purposes of submitting
SDA designation requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The Governor shall approve SDA designation requests from entities with a population of 200,000 or more that

to satisfy the criteria specified in section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act. The Governor shall offer to designate the remaining
reduced area as an SDA as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When there are competing applications under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the same geographic area and
the designation of the entity with the population closest to 200,000 would have the effect of reducing the population
of the competing entity to below a population of 200,000, the Governor has the discretion to determine which request
to honor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Governor may, in accordance with section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act, approve a request to be a SDA from any unit,
or contiguous units, of general local government, without regard to population, which serves a substantial portion

delivery area meets criteria established by the Governor which, at a minimum, shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The capability to effectively deliver job training services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The capacity to administer the job training program in accordance with the Act, applicable rules and regulations
and State standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The portion of a labor market to be served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4)(A) and (B) of the Act, the term ``substantial part''
and ``substantial portion'' of a labor market area shall be defined by the Governor, but shall not be less than 10% of
the population of a labor market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) All areas within the State shall be covered by designated SDA's. After honoring all requests for designation from
eligible entities under section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act, and making any qualified discretionary designations under
section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act, the Governor shall include uncovered areas in the State within other designated
SDA's willing to accept them or within a State administered SDA.

This part implements Title III of the Act. Title III programs seek to establish an early readjustment capacity for
workers and firms in each State; to provide comprehensive coverage to workers regardless of the cause of dislocation;
to provide early referral from the unemployment insurance system to adjustment services as an integral part of the
adjustment process; to foster labor, management and community partnerships with government in addressing worker
dislocation; to emphasize retraining and reemployment services rather than income support; to create an on-going
substate capacity to deliver adjustment services; to tailor services to meet the needs of individuals; to improve
accountability by establishing a system of mandated performance standards; to improve financial management by
monitoring expenditures and reallotting available funds; and to provide the flexibility to target funds to the most
critical dislocation problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (8) Immediately notify (within 48 hours) the appropriate substate grantees following receipt of an employer notice
of layoff or plant closing or of any other information that indicates a projected layoff or plant closing by an employer
in the grantee's substate area, in order to continue and expand the services initiated by the rapid response team (section
311(b)(3)(D)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (9) Fully consult with labor organizations where substantial numbers of their members are to be served; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (10) Disseminate throughout the State information on the availability of services and activities under Title III
of the Act and this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rapid response capability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The dislocated worker unit shall have one or more rapid response specialists, and the capability to provide rapid
response assistance, on-site, for dislocation events such as permanent closures and substantial layoffs throughout
the State. The State shall not transfer the responsibility for the rapid response assistance functions of the State
dislocated worker unit to another entity, but the State may contract with another entity to perform rapid response
assistance services. Nothing in this paragraph shall remove or diminish the dislocated worker unit's accountability
for ensuring the effective delivery of rapid response assistance services throughout the State (section 311(b)(12)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) State rapid response specialists should be knowledgeable about the resources available through programs under
this part and all other appropriate resources available through public and private sources to assist dislocated
workers. The expertise required by this part includes knowledge of the Federal, State, and local training and employment
systems; labor-management relations and collective bargaining activities; private industry and labor market
trends; programs and services available to veterans; and other fields necessary to carry out the rapid response requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The rapid response specialists should have: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The ability to organize a broad-based response to a dislocation event, including the ability to coordinate services
provided under this part with other State-administered programs available to assist dislocated workers, and the
ability to involve the substate grantee and local service providers in the assistance effort; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The authority to provide limited amounts of immediate financial assistance for rapid response activities,
including, where appropriate, financial assistance to labor-management committees formed under paragraph (c)(2)
of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Credibility among employers and in the employer community in order to effectively work with employers in difficult
situations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Credibility among employee groups and in the labor community, including organized labor, in order to effectively
work with employees in difficult situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) The dissemination of information on the State dislocated worker unit's services and activities should include
efforts to ensure that major employers, organized labor, and groups of employees not represented by organized labor,
are aware of the availability of rapid response assistance. The State dislocated worker unit should make equal effort
in responding to dislocation events without regard to whether the affected workers are represented by a union.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) In a situation involving an impending permanent closure or substantial layoff, a State may provide funds, where
other public or private resources are not expeditiously available, for a preliminary assessment of the advisability
of conducting a comprehensive study exploring the feasibility of having a company or group, including the workers,
purchase the plant and continue it in operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (5) Rapid response specialists may use funds available under this part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

48 hours or less) after becoming aware of a current or projected permanent closure or substantial layoff in order to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Provide information on and facilitate access to available public programs and services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) Provide emergency assistance adapted to the particular permanent closure or substantial layoff; such emergency
assistance may include financial assistance for appropriate rapid response activities, such as arranging for the
provision of early intervention services and other appropriate forms of immediate assistance in response to the
dislocation event;

 (iv) To collect information related to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) Economic dislocation (including potential closings or layoffs); and (B) All available resources within the
State for serving displaced workers, which information shall be made available on a regular basis to the Governor
and the State Council to assist in providing an adequate information base for effective program management, review,
and evaluation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) To provide or obtain appropriate financial and technical advice and liaison with economic development agencies
and other organizations to assist in efforts to avert worker dislocations;

 (vi) To disseminate information throughout the State on the availability of services and activities carried out
by the dislocated worker unit or office; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vii) To assist the local community in developing its own coordinated response and in obtaining access to State economic
development assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) Notwithstanding the definition of ``substantial layoff (for rapid response assistance)'' at &sect;631.2 of
this part;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) The Governor shall provide rapid response and basic readjustment services to members of a group of workers under
the NAFTA Worker Security Act for which the Governor has made a finding under &sect;631.3(j); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The Governor may, under exceptional circumstances, authorize rapid response assistance provided by a State
dislocated worker unit when the layoff is less than 50 or more individuals, is not at a single site of employment, or
does not take place during a single 30 day period. For purposes of this provision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exceptional circumstances
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include those situations which would have a major impact upon the community(ies) in which they occur (section 314(b)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labor-management committees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As provided in sections 301(b)(1) and 314(b)(1)(B) of the Act, labor-management committees are a form of rapid response
assistance which may be voluntarily established to respond to actual or prospective worker dislocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Labor management committees ordinarily include (but are not limited to) the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Shared and equal participation by workers and management, with members often selected in an informal fashion;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Shared financial participation between the company and the State, using funds provided under Title III of the
Act, in paying for the operating expenses of the committee; in some instances, labor union funds may help to pay committee
expenses;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Shall provide advice and leadership to the committee and prepare a report on its activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The ability to respond flexibly to the needs of affected workers by devising and implementing a strategy for assessing

(v) A formal agreement, terminable at will by the workers or the company management, and terminable for cause by the
Governor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Local job identification activities by the chairperson and members of the committee on behalf of the affected
workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Because they include employee representatives, labor-management committees typically provide a channel whereby
the needs of eligible dislocated workers can be assessed, and programs of assistance developed and implemented,
in an atmosphere supportive to each affected worker. As such, committees must be perceived to be representative and
fair in order to be most effective.

determining the incidence of need for worker dislocation assistance within the State. The formula may be amended
no more frequently than once each program year (section 302(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Governor may reserve an amount equal to not more than 40 percent of the funds allotted to the State under &sect;631.11

allocated to substate grantees and shall not be used for statewide activities. Such funds shall be included in each
substate grantee's allocation for purposes of cost limitations, as described in &sect;631.14 of this part (sections

requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section only upon a determination that the request is not consistent with
the effective delivery of services to eligible dislocated workers in the relevant labor market area, or would otherwise
not be appropriate to carry out the purposes of title III. The Governor will give good faith consideration to all such
requests by a consortium of SDAs to be a substate area. In denying a consortium's request for substate area designation,
the Governor shall set forth the basis and rationale for the denial (section 312(a)(5)).

area designation to the Secretary of Labor. The procedures that apply to such appeals shall be those set forth at &sect;628.405(g)
for appeals of the Governor's denial of SDA designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An entity described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that has been denied substate area designation may utilize
the State-level grievance procedures required by section 144(a) of the Act and subpart E of part 627 of this chapter

such agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

employment affording a reasonable expectation of long-term duration in the area in which the worker wishes to relocate,
or has obtained a bona fide offer of such employment, provided that the worker is totally separated from employment
at the time relocation commences. The cost of relocation for an eligible dislocated worker shall not exceed an amount
which is equal to the sum of the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in transporting the dislocated worker
and the dislocated worker's family, if any, and household effects, and a lump sum relocation allowance, equivalent
to three times such worker's average weekly wage. The maximum relocation allowance, however, shall not exceed $800,
unless a greater amount is justified in the grant application and approved by the Grant Officer. Necessary expenses
shall be travel expenses for the dislocated worker and the dislocated worker's family and for the transfer of household
effects. Reasonable costs for such travel and transfer expenses shall be by the least expensive, most reasonable
form of transportation.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would change the membership of the Papaya Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible
for local administration of the Hawaiian papaya marketing order. This proposal would increase the number of grower
members on the committee from six to nine and reduce the number of handler members from six to three. The number of growers
in the industry has increased in recent years, during the same period the number of handlers has remained constant.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 928 (7 CFR Part 928), as amended, regulating the handling of
papayas grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory rules to the scale of business subject to such rules in order that small businesses
will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued
thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on
their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas
grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers
and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;928.120, the committee currently consists of 13 members. Each member has an alternate. Six members
are growers, six are handlers, and one is a public member. The six handler members and alternates are nominated from
the production area at large. Grower membership on the committee is apportioned among three districts. District
1 (the Island of Hawaii) is represented by four members and alternates, and District 2 (the Islands of Kauai, Niihau,
Maui, Molakai, Lanai, Kahoolawe; and Kalawao county), and District 3 (the Island of Oahu) by one member and alternate
each. Any grower organization is limited to two members on the committee. Any handler organization is limited to one
member on the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 928.20 also allows the number of grower and handler members and alternate members on the committee and the
composition of the committee between growers and handlers to be changed as provided in &sect;928.31(o). Paragraph
(o) of &sect;928.31 also authorizes the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to redefine the districts
into which the production area is divided, reapportion membership on the committee. Any such changes are required
to reflect, insofar as practicable, structural changes within the industry and shifts in papaya production within
the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would change the composition of the committee by increasing grower representation on the committee from
six grower members to nine and reducing handler representation from six members to three. This change was recommended
by the committee on April 22, 1994, by a vote of 7 in favor, 3 opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The papaya industry has historically demonstrated a policy of maintaining equitable representation among handlers
and growers. In 1989, committee membership was changed by allocating three grower member positions from District
1 to handlers in the State of Hawaii. This resulted in an increase from three to six handler members and a decrease in
grower members from District 1 from seven to four. The committee indicated that the number of growers in the industry
has increased from 325 to 400 since 1989, while the number of handlers has remained constant. The committee contends
that these factors support their recommendation to change committee membership. This action is intended to provide
increased grower representation on the committee consistent with the increased number of growers. This rule would
not impose any additional costs on growers or handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members supporting this change stated that the marketing order is designed to primarily benefit growers and for that
reason growers should have a majority on the committee. Members supporting the recommendation also stated that this
change would increase growers' influence in matters concerning amendments to the marketing order, and market research
and development and promotion activities. The majority of that increase occurred in District 1. Members opposed
to the change in the current committee membership stated that the marketing order should benefit the entire industry,
and believe the current composition of the committee provides a good balance for the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee indicated that the increase in the number of growers producing papayas in District 1, justified increasing
from four to seven the number of growers representing District 1 on the committee. Committee members supporting this
change contend that the vast majority of growers and the highest level of papaya production are located in District
1. District 1 is expected to produce 55.6 million pounds during the 1993&hyph;94 season. Over the last four years District
1 has had an average annual production of 54.1 million pounds of papayas. For the same period District 2 has an average
production of 760,000 pounds, and District 3 has an average production of 1,020,000 pounds of papayas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend its regulations on accounting policies and procedures
for REA electric borrowers as set forth in REA's regulation concerning Accounting Requirements for REA Electric
Borrowers, Uniform System of Accounts. This proposed rule would eliminate the requirement that REA borrowers place
the difference between the amount accrued for postretirement benefits during the year and the amount paid on a ``pay-as-you-go''
basis in an external, irrevocable trust to be used solely for postretirement benefits. REA borrowers may, however,
elect to voluntarily fund their postretirement benefit obligations. This proposed rule would set forth new accounting
interpretations that address the requirements of recently issued pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board concerning the accounting for postemployment benefits and the accounting for certain investments in debt
and equity securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, this proposed rule would also set forth a new accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds
received from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). It would also clarify the accounting prescribed
for computer software costs by specifying the accounts to which generalized software costs should be amortized and
to which the costs of maintaining, updating, and converting files should be expensed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this proposal would identify the organizational unit within REA to which borrower requests for departures
from or interpretations of the REA Uniform System of Accounts (USoA) should be submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to facilitate the effective and economical operation of a business enterprise, adequate and reliable financial
records must be maintained. Accounting records must provide a clear and accurate picture of current economic conditions
from which management can make informed decisions in charting the company's future. The rate regulated environment
in which an electric utility operates causes an even greater need for financial information that is accurate, complete,
and comparable with that of other electric utilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA, as a federal lender and mortgagee, and in furthering the objectives of the Rural Electrification Act (RE Act)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has a legitimate programmatic interest and a substantial financial interest in requiring adequate records to be
maintained. In order to provide REA with financial information that can be analyzed and compared with the operations
of other borrowers in the REA program, all REA borrowers must maintain financial records that utilize uniform accounts
and uniform accounting policies and procedures. The standard REA security instrument, therefore, requires borrowers
to maintain their books, records, and accounts in accordance with methods and principles of accounting prescribed
by REA in the USoA for its electric borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that borrowers consistently account for and apply the provisions of recent pronouncements of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the USoA must be revised and updated as changes in generally accepted accounting principles
occur. REA is, therefore, proposing to add two new accounting interpretations to Section 1767.41, Accounting Methods
and Procedures Required of All REA Borrowers, that address the accounting requirements recently set forth in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement No. 112),
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
(Statement No. 115). Statement No. 112 establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for employers
who provide benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement while Statement No.
115 establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities and for investments
in equity securities that readily have determinable fair values. Copies of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
may be obtained from the Order Department of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116, Norwalk, Connecticut 06856&hyph;5116. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA is also proposing to amend accounting Interpretation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 626, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, to establish the accounting policies and procedures
for the Rural Economic Development Grant program recently established by REA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interpretation No. 604, Deferred Compensation, sets forth the specific accounting entries and the balance sheet
reporting requirements for participation in the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association's Deferred Compensation
Program. Under the terms of this program, a portion of an employee's current salary may be deferred until such time
as the employee retires or terminates employment. The employer makes a contribution into the deferred compensation
fund in an amount equal to the salary deferred. As such, the borrower records both an asset and a liability_an asset
in the amount of the contributions to the fund and a liability to that employee for future payment of the deferred compensation.
Current REA procedures require the asset and liability to be offset for financial reporting purposes. Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts, states that
the offsetting of assets and liabilities in the balance is improper except where a right of offset exists and a right
of offset exists only when each of two parties owes the other determinable amounts. Contributions to the deferred
compensation fund are payable to the borrower and, as such, the right of offset does not exist. REA is, therefore, proposing
to amend Interpretation No. 604 to comply with generally accepted accounting principles by requiring the asset and
liability to be reported separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (Statement No. 106). Statement
No. 106 requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits during the years in which
the employee provides service to the reporting entity. Prior to the issuance of Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis; that
is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the reporting entity in exchange for
the benefits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an employer promises to exchange future
benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care,
life insurance, tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The REA USoA parallels the USoA prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for electric utilities
and, as such, is consistent with the standards of financial accounting for the electric utility industry as a whole.
As FERC amends its USoA, REA reviews the appropriateness and applicability of each amendment and proposes revisions,
as necessary, to the REA USoA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 17, 1992, FERC issued its policy statement on postretirement benefits. Included in its statement was
the requirement that natural gas pipelines and public utilities make cash deposits into an irrevocable, external
trust fund, in amounts that are proportional and, on an annual basis, equal to the annual test period allowance for
postretirement benefits. REA reviewed and analyzed these accounting policies and procedures, including the funding
requirement, and promulgated these requirements in its USoA. The REA USoA requires REA borrowers to fund the liability
associated with postretirement benefit costs by making cash deposits into an irrevocable trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the final rule, REA borrowers and their representatives through the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association, have questioned the necessity for REA borrowers to fund their postretirement benefit
obligations. FERC and a majority of state utility commissions require funding for the inclusion of postretirement
benefit expenses in rates, in order to deter investor owned utilities from arbitrarily increasing postretirement
benefit costs. Due to the many variables involved in estimating postretirement benefit costs, the cost incorporated
into rates can be easily manipulated if an investor owned utility desires to increase cash flow through increased
accruals of postretirement benefit costs. By requiring utilities to fund an amount equal to the postretirement benefit
costs that were recovered through rates, much of the incentive for investor owned utilities to over estimate postretirement
benefit costs is eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ratepayers/consumers, and investors/owners of an REA electric borrower, because of its cooperative organizational
structure, are one in the same. REA cooperatives do not, therefore, have this same incentive to over estimate postretirement
benefits costs because profits do not accrue to a separate, different class of investors/owners. In fact, REA electric
borrowers have no incentive to over estimate postretirement benefit costs to increase rates since the investors/owners
are the same as the ratepayers/consumers. REA is proposing to eliminate the funding requirement currently contained
in Section 1767.41, Interpretation No. 627, Postretirement Benefits. REA borrowers may, however, elect to voluntarily
fund their postretirement benefit obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, REA is proposing to revise Section 1767.13, Departures from the Prescribed REA Uniform System of Accounts,
and Section 1767.14, Interpretations of the REA Uniform System of Accounts, to specifically identify the organizational
unit within REA to which requests for departures from and interpretations of the REA USoA should be addressed. This
revision should assist borrowers in filing requests and should expedite the review process within REA.

136&blank;Storm Damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent hurricane, flood, and ice storm damage, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) has
received several inquiries concerning the proper accounting for storm damage costs and the associated funds received
from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Storm damage costs should be accounted for under the work order procedure. Units of property destroyed or otherwise
removed from service must be reflected on retirement work orders and units of property installed must be shown on construction
work orders. To ensure that the accounting for construction and retirement costs is as accurate as possible, an effort
should be made to accurately accumulate material, labor, and overhead costs. Even when extreme care has been exercised,
however, it may still be necessary to use estimates to develop the appropriate cost figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a storm occurs, a utility typically incurs a large retirement loss, all or a part of which should be charged to the
accumulated provision for depreciation. Storm damage costs over and above construction and retirement costs represent
maintenance expense. Maintenance costs include the costs of resagging lines, straightening poles, and replacing
minor items of property. When extensive damage has occurred, the need to restore the property to an operating condition
without delay usually results in excessive costs being incurred. Standard property unit costs may be used as a guide
in determining the amount to be capitalized. It should be noted, however, that when standard property unit costs are
used, all excess costs are charged to maintenance expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the storm's destruction, property is retired prematurely and as a result, extraordinary retirement losses
occur. When such extraordinary losses occur, they should be recorded in the year in which the losses are incurred.
If the recording of such losses will materially distort the income statement, such losses may be charged to Account
435, Extraordinary Deductions. These costs may be deferred and amortized to future periods only if the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation
(Statement No. 71), are applied. Under the provisions of Statement No. 71, a utility may defer certain costs, provided
such costs are included in the utility's rate base and recovered through future rates. If an REA borrower elects to
apply the provisions of Statement No. 71, REA approval is required. To obtain REA approval, a borrower must submit:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A copy of the state Commission order authorizing recovery of the deferred costs through future rates, or in the absence
of commission jurisdiction, a resolution from the cooperative's board of directors authorizing such recovery;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A statement from the borrower's certified public accountant (CPA) or CPA firm indicating that the deferral and
amortization of these costs is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in the restoration of the damaged facilities, the Federal government often provides assistance through
FEMA. Under current FEMA procedures, FEMA provides funds for the restoration of facilities based upon the cost estimates
submitted by the entity requesting assistance. If the FEMA grant is for less than 100 percent of the cost estimates,
FEMA does not specify which costs are to be reimbursed. When the funds are received, therefore, they should be accounted
for by crediting construction, retirement, and maintenance expense in direct proportion to the total costs incurred.
For example, if total storm damage costs are $1,000,000 with $500,000 incurred for maintenance, $300,000 for retirement,
and $200,000 for construction, the FEMA reimbursement should be accounted for by applying 50 percent of the funds
received as a credit to maintenance expense, 30 percent as a credit to retirement costs, and 20 percent as a credit to
construction.

&blank;401&blank;Computer Software Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computer software consists of programs and routines (sets of computer instructions) which direct the operation
of the computer. Software may refer to generalized routines useful in computer operations or to programs for specific
applications such as payroll. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction between generalized software and application software is important. Generalized software provides
operating support for individual applications. This would include programs for such tasks as making printouts of
machine-readable records, sorting records, organizing and maintaining files, translating programs written in
a symbolic language into machine-language instructions, and scheduling jobs through the computer. These programs
are generally furnished by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application software consists of a set of instructions for performing a particular data processing task. Application
programs are generally written by the user installation, but are frequently obtained as prewritten packages from
software vendors. Application software includes programs such as payroll, billing, general ledger, as well as engineering
or managerial applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs incurred with the purchase or development of computer software shall be accounted for as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Capitalize in a subaccount of Account 391, Office Furniture and Equipment, all costs for generalized software.
Depreciate the cost over the service life (or remaining life) of the main hardware (i.e., containing central processor).
If the purchase invoice does not break out or assign a cost to the ``generalized software,'' it is appropriate to include
the full amount in hardware costs. Defer in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, the cost of all applications
software determined to have a service life of over one year. Amortize this cost to Account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization,
over the estimated useful life of the program. This amortization period shall not exceed five (5) years. We realize,
however, that there may be circumstances that justify a useful life longer than 5 years. When this is the case and it
is management's intent to utilize these programs over an extended period, written justification shall be submitted
to REA for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Expense in Account 921, Office Supplies and Expenses, in the period incurred, all costs associated with the maintenance,
updating, and conversion of files or revision of all software, and all costs for software with a useful life of less
than 1 year. Also, expense the unamortized cost of all software determined, during year, to be no longer used by or useful
to the cooperative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the total cost of purchased or internally developed software, the following items shall be included:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Costs incurred for feasibility studies if they result in the purchase or development of software; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All costs related to the actual purchase or development of the software. These costs must be specifically identifiable
with the software and properly supported by time cards, invoices, or other documents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. All costs incurred in ``testing and debugging'' the software.

Account 107, Construction Work-in-Progress, provided that the following criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. The computer program is specifically dedicated to performing a construction related activity, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The cost of the software is itemized separate and apart from other hardware and software costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The cost of software programs meeting the above requirements and having an estimated useful service life in excess
of 1 year shall be recorded in Account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, and amortized to Account 107, Construction
Work-in-Progress, over the estimated service life of the program not to exceed 5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All costs related to training personnel in the use of software shall be expensed as incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accounting in this section is not intended to apply to immaterial amounts. When it is deemed that the costs of the

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
than Pensions (Statement No. 106), requires reporting entities to accrue the expected cost of postretirement benefits
during the years the employee provides service to the entity. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement
No. 106, members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative. Prior to the issuance
of Statement No. 106, most reporting entities accounted for postretirement benefit costs on a ``pay-as-you-go''
basis; that is, costs were recognized when paid, not when the employee provided service to the entity in exchange for
the benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined in Statement No. 106, a postretirement benefit plan is a deferred compensation arrangement in which an
employer promises to exchange future benefits for an employee's current services. Postretirement benefit plans
may be funded or unfunded. Postretirement benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, life insurance,
tuition assistance, day care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided outside of a pension plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This statement applies to both written plans and to plans whose existence is implied from a practice of paying postretirement
benefits. An employer's practice of providing postretirement benefits to selected employees under individual
contracts with specified terms determined on an employee-by-employee basis does not, however, constitute a postretirement
benefit plan under the provisions of this statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postretirement benefit plans generally fall into three categories: single-employer defined benefit plans, multi-employer
plans, and multiple-employer plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accounting requirements set forth in this interpretation focus on single- and multiple-employer plans. The
accounting requirements set forth in Statement No. 106 for multiemployer plans or defined contribution plans shall
be adopted for borrowers electing those types of plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of Statement No. 106, there are two components of the postretirement benefit cost: the current
period cost and the transition obligation. The transition obligation is a one-time accrual of the costs resulting
from services already provided. Statement No. 106 allows the transition obligation to be deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees. If the average remaining
service life of the employees is less than 20 years, a 20-year amortization period may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Accounting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All REA borrowers must adopt the accrual accounting provisions and reporting requirements set forth in Statement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 106. The transition obligation and accrual of the current period cost must be based upon an actuarial study. This
study must be updated to allow the borrower to comply with the measurement date requirements of Statement No. 106;
however, the study must, at a minimum, be updated every five years. REA will not allow electric borrowers to account
for postretirement benefits on a ``pay-as-you-go'' basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation does not require REA approval provided that it complies
with the provisions of Statement No. 106. If, however, a borrower elects to expense the transition obligation in the
current period and subsequently defer this expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, the deferral must be approved by REA. In those states
in which the commission will not allow the recovery of the transition obligation through future rates, the transition
obligation must be expensed, in its entirety, in the year in which Statement No. 106 is adopted. A portion of the transition
obligation may be charged to construction and retirement activities provided such charges are properly supported.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For plans outside the United States and for defined benefit plans of employers that (a) Are nonpublic enterprises
and (b) sponsor defined benefit postretirement plans with no more than 500 plan participants in the aggregate, Statement
No. 106 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. For all other plans, Statement No. 106 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA borrowers must comply with the implementation dates set forth in Statement No. 106. At the time of the adoption
of Statement No. 106, rates must be in place sufficient to recover the current period expense and any amortization
of the transition obligation. A copy of a board resolution or commission order, as appropriate, indicating that the
transition obligation and current period expense have been included in the borrower's rates must be submitted to
REA.

3. The deferral and amortization of the transition obligation under the provisions of Statement No. 106 is considered
to be an off balance sheet item. If, therefore, the borrower elects to defer and amortize the transition obligation
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the active employees or 20 years in accordance
with Statement No. 106, no entry is required. Instead, the transition obligation is recognized as a component of postretirement
benefit cost as it is amortized. It should be noted, however, that the amount of the unamortized transition obligation
must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Postemployment Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits (Statement
No. 112) establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for employers who provide benefits to former
or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Inactive employees are those who are not currently
rendering service to the employer but who have not been terminated, including employees who are on disability leave,
regardless of whether they are expected to return to active service. For purposes of applying the provisions of Statement
No. 112, former members of the board of directors are considered to be employees of the cooperative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postemployment benefits include benefits provided to former or inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered
dependents. They include, but are not limited to, salary continuation, supplemental benefits (including workmen's
compensation), health care, job training and counseling, and life insurance coverage. Benefits may be provided
in cash or in kind and may be paid upon cessation of active employment or over a specified period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of providing postemployment benefits is considered to be a part of the compensation provided to an employee
in exchange for current service and should, therefore, be accrued as the employee earns the right to be paid for future
postemployment benefits. Applying the criteria set forth in Statement No. 43, a postemployment benefit obligation
is accrued when all of the following conditions are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The employer's obligation for payment for future absences is attributable to employees' services already performed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The obligation relates to employee rights that vest or accumulate. Vested rights are considered those rights for
which the employer is obligated to make payment even if the employee terminates. Rights that accumulate are those
earned, but unused rights to compensated absences that may be carried forward to one or more periods subsequent to
the period in which they are earned;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Payment of the compensation is probable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The amount can be reasonably estimated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
If all of these conditions are not met, the employer must account for its postemployment benefit obligation in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (Statement No. 5) when it becomes
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If an obligation for postemployment benefits is not accrued in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 5 or
Statement No. 43 only because the amount cannot be reasonable estimated, the financial statements should disclose
that fact.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
(Statement No. 115), establishes the standards of financial accounting and reporting for investments in debt securities
and for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. Statement No. 115 does not apply
to investments in equity securities accounted for under the equity method nor to investments in consolidated subsidiaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of acquisition, an entity must classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories: held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading. At the balance sheet date, the appropriateness of the classifications must be reassessed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and are measured at amortized cost in the balance
sheet only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Debt securities
are not classified as held-to-maturity if the entity has the intent to hold the security only for an indefinite period;
for example if the security would become available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates and related
changes in the security's prepayment risk, needs for liquidity, changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative
investments, changes in funding sources and terms, and changes in foreign currency risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity and equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values are classified as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities and are
measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Trading securities are those securities that are bought and held principally
for the purpose of selling them in the near future. Trading generally reflects active and frequent buying and selling
and trading securities are generally used with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in
prices. Available-for-sale securities are those investments not classified as either trading securities or held-to-maturity
securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement No. 115 requires unrealized holding gains and losses for trading securities to be included in earnings
in the current period. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from
earnings; however, they are reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For individual securities classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, an entity must determine
whether a decline in the security's fair value below the amortized cost is other than temporary. If the decline in fair
value is determined to be permanent, that is, it is probable that the entity will not be able to collect all amounts due
under the contractual terms of the security, the realized loss is accounted for in earnings of the current period.
The new cost basis is not adjusted upward for subsequent recoveries in the fair value. Subsequent increases in the
fair value of available-for-sale securities are included in the separate component of equity. Subsequent decreases
are also included in the separate component of equity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All trading securities are reported as current assets in the balance sheet and individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale
securities are classified as either current or noncurrent, as appropriate. Cash flows from the purchase, sale, or
maturity of available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities are classified in the statement of
cash flows as cash flows from investing activities and reported gross for each security classification.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Veterans Education and Employment Amendments of 1989 and the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1990,
contain provisions which change significantly the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These two acts expand this
program by adding new types of permissible training such as apprenticeship and other on-job training, cooperative
training, and flight training. Furthermore, the eligibility provisions are significantly liberalized. For instance,
the attainment of a baccalaureate degree or equivalent evidence of completion of study will no longer bar some reservists
from training under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. This proposal will acquaint the public with the way
in which VA (Department of Veterans Affairs), the Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportation intend
to implement these provisions of these two acts.

 Comments must be received on or before November 1, 1994. Comments will be available for public inspection until November
14, 1994. With two exceptions VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation propose to make these
amended regulations effective on the same date as the provisions of law they implement. Accordingly, it is proposed
to make the amendments to &sect;&sect;21.7639(a), 21.7642(a)(7), (8) and (9), 21.7653 and 21.7672(d) retroactively
effective on December 18, 1989. It is proposed to make the new paragraphs &sect;&sect;21.7576(b)(7), 21.7576(b)(5)
and 21.7639(j), the amendment to &sect;21.7620(b) and those portions of the amendments to &sect;&sect;21.7520(b)(19),
21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which deal with flight training retroactively effective on September 30, 1990. It is proposed
to make the new section, &sect;21.7645, retroactively effective on May 1, 1990. It is proposed to make the amendments
to &sect;&sect;21.7654(a) and (b) and 21.7640(a)(1) effective on the date they have received final approval from
all three Departments. Finally, it is proposed to make all other new sections and paragraphs and the amendments to
all other regulations, including those portions of &sect;&sect;21.7520(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which
do not deal with flight training retroactively effective on October 1, 1990.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Veterans Employment Amendments of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;237) and the Department of Defense Authorization Act,
1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;189), contain provisions which affect the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. These include
expanding this program to include additional types of training, liberalizing the eligibility requirements for
this program, and permitting recipients of benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve to participate
in VA's work-study program. The provisions concerning work-study were further amended by Pub. L. 102&hyph;16 to
permit training at Coast Guard and National Guard facilities. Regulations must be amended so that they implement
the new provisions of law.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pub. L. 101&hyph;237 permits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to require a reservist to submit a verification of
continued pursuit of a reservist's program of education before releasing the monthly benefit to him or her. This proposal
contains regulations which would require these verifications from reservists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been a long-standing requirement of VA that monthly benefits would not be released to students training under
the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty until they submitted a monthly verification that they are continuing to pursue
their programs of education. During 1989 VA conducted a study to determine whether this monthly self-verification
was cost-effective. The study found that not only was it cost-effective for the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty, but
that it also would be cost-effective in the other educational programs which VA administers. The study discovered
that over 50% of the overpayments in a sample of non-Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty cases would not have occurred if
all educational programs had monthly self-verification of pursuit. Accordingly, VA, the Department of Defense
and the Coast Guard are proposing amendments to &sect;&sect;21.7640 and 21.7654 which would extend monthly self-verification
of pursuit to the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve. At the same time the requirement that an educational institution
verify pursuit at least annually is being eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been a long-standing requirement of law that a reservist maintain satisfactory progress and conduct in order
to receive educational assistance. In order that this provision of law be met, &sect;21.7653 has required that educational
institutions report to VA whenever a reservist is not making satisfactory progress or conduct. Pub. L. 101&hyph;237
amended 38 U.S.C. 3474 to provide that VA would not pay educational assistance to a reservist who has an unsatisfactory
attendance record. Since each educational institution with an attendance standard is responsible for enforcing
it, VA, the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard are proposing to amend &sect;21.7653 to require that educational
institutions report to VA whenever a reservist's attendance is unsatisfactory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation have determined
that these amended regulations do not contain a major rule as that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation.
The regulations will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy, and will not cause a major increase in costs
or prices for anyone. They will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,
innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic
or export markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation have certified that
these amended regulations, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
605(b), the amended regulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses
requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This certification can be made because the regulations affect only individuals. They will have no significant economic
impact on small entities, i.e., small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmental
jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the amendments
to &sect;&sect;21.7639(a), 21.7642(a)(7), (8) and (9), 21.7652 and 21.7672(d), like the provisions of law they
implement, retroactively effective on December 18, 1989. VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation
find that good cause exists for making the new paragraphs &sect;21.7576(b)(7), 21.7635(b)(5) and 21.7639(j), the
amendments to &sect;21.7620(b) and those portions of the amendments to &sect;&sect;21.752)(b)(19), 21.7576(a)
and 21.7622(f) which deal with flight training, like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective
on September 30, 1990. VA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists
for making the new &sect;21.7645, like the provisions of law it implements, retroactively effective on May 1, 1990.
VA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation find that good cause exists for making the remainder
of the amendments to the regulations (excluding the amendments to &sect;&sect;21.7654(a) and (b) and 21.7640(a)(1)
but including those portions of &sect;&sect;21.7520(b)(19), 21.7576(a) and 21.7622(f) which do not deal with flight
training), like the provisions of law they implement, retroactively effective on October 1, 1990. These provisions
are intended to achieve a benefit for the reservist. The maximum benefits intended in the provisions of law implemented
by the above proposed regulatory amendments will be achieved through prompt implementation. Hence, a delayed effective
date would be contrary to statutory design; would complicate administration of these provisions of law; and might
result in the denial of a benefit to a reservist who is entitled to it.

The information collection contained in the proposed revisions to &sect;21.7640 is identical to that used in the
administration of the Montgomery GI Bill_Active Duty. The revisions to &sect;21.7640 account for 36,973 hours of
the information collection approved under 2900&hyph;2073. This is estimated to average 10 minutes per response.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;21.7654 also contains information collection requirements which will result in a reporting burden.
The reporting burden is estimated to average 5 minutes per response for a total of 67,258 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed &sect;21.7653(d) contains information collection requirements which will result in a reporting burden.
The reporting burden is estimated to average 5 minutes per response for a total of 517 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average estimated time for response for all these reporting burdens includes the time for reviewing instructions,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, VA is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) a request that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments for consideration by OMB on these proposed information collection requirements should address
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,

(1) Except for those pursuing flight training, correspondence training, cooperative training, apprenticeship
or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against entitlement_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit for which the reservist is paid educational assistance)
if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a
three-quarter, one-half or less than one-half time basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the award of educational assistance to date of discontinuance.
If the reservist changes his or her training time after the commencing date of the award, VA will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the reservist's training time remains
constant, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For each month that a reservist is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship
or other on-job training VA will make a charge against entitlement of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) .75 of a month in the case of payments made during the first six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of
apprenticeship or other on-job training,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) .55 of a month in the case of payments made during the second six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program
of apprenticeship or other on-job training, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) .35 of a month in the case of payments made following the first twelve months of the reservist's pursuit of the
program of apprenticeship or other on-job training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement
for each payment made to him or her. The charge will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, as determined
by dividing the amount of the payment by $140.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An approved program may consist of courses offered by two educational institutions concurrently, or courses offered

Concurrent enrollment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a reservist cannot schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program
of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the reservist must show that his or her complete program
of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his
or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled within the period in which he
or she plans to complete his or her program. A reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue as provided
in &sect;21.7540(b) (2) and (3) may pursue courses only at an institution of higher learning. If such a reservist cannot
complete his or her program at one institution of higher learning, VA may approve a concurrent enrollment only if both
the educational institutions the reservist enrolls in are institutions of higher learning.

(A) Is offered by an institution of higher learning, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Does not lead to a standard college degree; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The institution of higher learning requires as part of the reservist's program of education one or more unit subjects
for which credit is granted toward a standard college degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When measuring a reservist's enrollment during a semester or quarter when he or she is pursuing one or more courses
which the educational institution measures on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit to equivalent clock
hours as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and combine them with the clock hours of the other courses measured
by the school on that basis, as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) VA shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Determine the equivalent clock hour factor by dividing the number of clock hours which constitute full time for
the enrollment as stated in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section by the number of credit hours which constitute a full
time undergraduate enrollment at the educational institution as stated in paragraph (a) of this section, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) and (6) of this section, multiply the number of credit hours in which the
reservist is enrolled by the equivalent clock hour factor as determined by paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. This
will result in the number of equivalent clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) VA will add the number of clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled to the number of equivalent clock hours in
which he or she is enrolled. The result will be compared to paragraph (e) or (f) to determine the reservist's training
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When the number of class sessions per credit hours is so low that &sect;21.4272(f)(2)(ii) or (3) would control
the way in which VA would measure those credit hours, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii)
of this section by multiplying the number of class sessions determined by the equivalent clock hour factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When the reservist is attending a nonstandard term, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii)
of this section by determining the equivalent credit hours in which the reservist is enrolled as provided in &sect;21.4272(g),
and multiplying the equivalent credit hours by the equivalent clock hour factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) In calculations required by this paragraph, fractions of an equivalent clock hour will be dropped.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 states that the Postal Service shall make available to a state or local
voting registration official the rate for any class of mail that is available to a qualified nonprofit organization
under 39 U.S.C. 3626 for the purpose of making a mailing that the official certifies is required by the Act. The law applies
only to state or local voting registration officials in those states and the District of Columbia that require a voter
to register to vote before the date of voting in a general election for public office. In accordance with this legislation,
the Postal Service proposes an amendment to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) section E370.3.0 to describe the mailers eligible
for an authorization to mail at the special rates, and to DMM E370.5.0 to describe the matter that may be mailed by those
entitled to mail at the special rates under the new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As information, the procedures for mailers seeking authorization under the new provisions, and mailing under these
authorizations, will be similar to those for nonprofit organizations mailing at the special rates. Each state and
local voting registration official must submit Form 3624, Application to Mail at Special Bulk Third-Class Rates,
at each post office where materials will be mailed at the special bulk third-class rates. Voting registration officials
will not be allowed to mail at the special rates before receiving an authorization from the Postal Service. After submitting
an application, the voting registration official may mail qualifying material under a pending arrangement through
arrangements with the postmaster. If the application is approved, the Postal Service will refund to the voting registration
official the difference in postage paid between the regular rates and the special bulk third-class rates for mailings
made after the effective date of the authorization. The authorization should be requested, and will be issued, by
the title of the official head of the government agency responsible for the registration of voters. As with all mailers
authorized to mail at the special rates, only third-class matter, deposited in prescribed minimum quantities and
prepared in accordance with postal regulations, is eligible for these rates. In addition to these general requirements,
the material must also be required or authorized by the Act. Finally, mailers must complete and deposit with each permit
imprint mailing the appropriate mailing statement: Form 3602&hyph;N, Statement of Mailing With Permit Imprint
Third-Class Mail (Nonprofit Rates Only); or Form 3602&hyph;PVN, Plant-Verified Drop Shipment (PVDS) Consolidated
Mailing Statement Register Third-Class (Special Rates Only: Permit Imprint). The certification sections on the
statements will be modified by inserting a new item number 6 as follows and renumbering current item 6 as item 7:

Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as required by Sections 110 and 172 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410 and 7502. The submittal consists of Administrative
Orders representing the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131. In this action, USEPA
is proposing to disapprove the State's submittal based on enforceability and attainment demonstration concerns.
The MPCA must address the concerns detailed in this action and submit the Administrative Order to USEPA before the
end of the 30-day comment period. If no other substantive, adverse comments are received and MPCA adequately responds
the USEPA's concerns before the end of the 30-day comment period, USEPA intends to proceed with a direct final approval
of the submittal. If, however, the concerns are not adequately addressed before that time, USEPA will finalize the
disapproval. The direct final rulemaking would provide an opportunity for the public to comment on the final rulemaking
action.

I. Summary of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 11, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a revision to the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The seven-county
metropolitan area (AQCR 131) has been designated, by the USEPA, as nonattainment for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (40 C.F.R. 81.324). The submittal is intended to demonstrate attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in AQCR 131 for the area surrounding the Ashland Petroleum Company. The remainder of the area (Dakota County/Pine
Bend and the rest of the Twin Cities) is being addressed in separate rulemakings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA published the designation of AQCR 131 as a primary nonattainment area for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962). The MPCA submitted a final SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 plan on August 4, 1980. USEPA published its final rule approving and promulgating the Minnesota Part D SIP for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for AQCR 131 on April 8, 1981 (46 FR 20997). The MPCA submitted a request for redesignation to attainment of AQCR 131,
except for the Pine Bend area of Dakota County, on September 2, 1983. The redesignation request included permits for
several facilities, as well as, monitoring data and dispersion modeling intended to support the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA requested several revisions to the permits and compliance data included in the 1983 submittal. In addition,
the Stack Height Rule promulgated on July 8, 1985, required the State to review all existing emission limitations
to determine whether any of these limitations had been affected by stack height credit above Good Engineering Practice
(GEP) stack height or by other dispersion techniques. As a result of this review, MPCA determined that Ashland Petroleum
Company (in addition to NSP-Riverside, and Koch Refining Company-Pine Bend) would require additional permit revisions
due to modeled violations using the reduced creditable stack heights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the numerous changes which had occurred since the original redesignation request was submitted in 1983, the
submittal was withdrawn by the MPCA. A new SIP revision for Ashland Refining Company was submitted on June 30, 1987.
A SIP revision and redesignation request for the remainder of AQCR 131, excluding the Pine Bend area of Dakota County,
was submitted by the MPCA on September 10, 1987. The MPCA later withdrew the June 30, 1987, SIP revision because Ashland
Refining Company could not meet one of the emission limits listed in the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 11, 1992, the MPCA submitted a SIP revision for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of AQCR 131. The submittal includes an Administrative Order for Ashland Petroleum
Company_St. Paul Park Refinery, in addition to dispersion modeling and technical support intended to show that the
limits in the Administrative Order are sufficient to attain the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the AQCR 131 nonattainment area near Ashland Petroleum Company.

II. Attainment Demonstration Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section will provide a general description of the State submittal followed by USEPA's review of the attainment
demonstration, including modeling specifics of the Administrative Order for the Ashland Petroleum Company. A more
detailed description of the Administrative Order and the attainment demonstration is included in the technical
support document associated with this action.

Description of State Emission Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission units at the Ashland Refining Company_St. Paul Park facility that discharge sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere
are: three process steam boilers, 27 process heaters, one fluidized catalytic cracker regenerator, two sulfur recovery
units with a common Shell Claus Offgas Treatment (SCOT) tailgas unit, two diesel generators and heater decoking operations.
Specific emission limits and operating limits are listed in the administrative order for these sources. In addition,
sulfur control limits are applied to the diesel fuel and hydrogen sulfide limits are applied to the refinery gas. Compliance
with the emission limitations and operating restrictions shall be demonstrated through the combined use of continuous
emission monitors (CEMS) designed to measure SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, continuous monitoring systems (CMS) that record fuel flowrate, and hydrogen sulfide content, and regular
fuel analysis and supplier certification to determine the sulfur content and heating value of the fuel oil and diesel
fuel. A stack test will be used to determine initial compliance at Emission Point 15 (SRU's and SCOT, and boilers 4 &amp;
6). It has been determined, based on guidance in the ``General Preamble for Future Proposed Rulemakings,'' published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that the compliance methods listed above provide for continuous compliance monitoring.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Description of State General Modeling Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modeling techniques used in the demonstration are based on the modeling guidelines in place at the time the analyses
were performed (i.e., ``Guideline on Air Quality Models, (Revised),'' July 1986, including ``Supplement A,'' July
1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dispersion modeling conducted for this demonstration was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term
(ISCST) model (version 90346) for calculation of the 24-hour, 3-hour, and annual concentrations. The model was run
using the regulatory default option and urban mode 3 (McElroy-Pooler) dispersion coefficients. Although a land
use analysis around Ashland Refining Company would classify the area as rural, urban dispersion coefficients were
applied based on the results of a preliminary model/monitor comparison study which indicated that the available
rural models underpredict ambient concentrations. To assure attainment, MPCA found it necessary to apply the more
conservative urban dispersion coefficients. The State did not use the most recent version of the Industrial Source
Complex model, known as ISC2. The MPCA had completed the modeling to determine appropriate SIP limits before the ISC2
model was released. Therefore, based on USEPA guidance concerning grandfathering in the January 2, 1985, memorandum
from Joseph A. Tikvart, Chief, Source Receptor Analysis Branch, to the Regional Modeling Contacts, the use of the
ISCS2 version 90346 model is acceptable for this particular submittal. Future modeling of the AQCR 131 area will need
to be conducted using the ISC2 model.

Meteorological Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis used 1 year of on-site meteorological data (1988). As a comparison, the MPCA conducted supplemental
modeling using 1973&hyph;1977 Minneapolis Airport surface meteorological data, and St. Cloud mixing height data.
The results showed that the on-site meteorological data resulted in higher predicted 3-hour and 24-hour concentrations.
However, both data sets produced concentrations demonstrating modeled attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. Background concentrations of SO

values. Historic monitoring data (1984) was considered in ascertaining the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unmodeled background concentration. The modeling inventory also included many minor sources whose collective
contributions were classified in the submittal as ``background.'' These modeled ``background'' values, along
with the monitored values, were included in the critical concentrations identified in the attainment demonstration.

The sulfur impacts were calculated over a 4-kilometer by 4-kilometer area with 100 meter resolution. Terrain effects
were considered. Complex terrain impacts were determined by using the COMPLEX1 model run in the VALLEY mode. The predicted
24-hour concentrations for the complex run was less than the ISCST simple terrain run; therefore, ISCST results were
used for establishing the SO

All Ashland Refinery stacks were modeled using the lesser of the actual stack height or 65 meters. Building downwash
was not incorporated in the original attainment demonstration because MPCA maintained the stack heights at the facility
were sufficiently high to avoid downwash. The USEPA requested, and received from the State, documentation demonstrating
that the significant sources at the facility were not subject to building downwash.

Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act requires that the Minnesota SIP prohibit emissions which would prevent attainment
or maintenance of the NAAQS in any other State. The Wisconsin border is approximately 40 kilometers (km) to the east
of the sources included in this attainment demonstration. For each source which was explicitly modeled in this submittal,
attainment in the adjacent State was demonstrated through supplemental dispersion modeling. This modeling showed
either decreasing or steady concentration gradients in the direction of the adjacent State and demonstrated that
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions allowed in Minnesota would not prevent attainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) in Wisconsin.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA has identified deficiencies in the Ashland Petroleum Company Administrative Order that the MPCA must adequately
address before the USEPA can proceed with a final approval. The deficiencies are presented in the following comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On page 6, under the definition of 24-hour average, the word ``quality'' must be replaced by the word ``quantity.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On page 9, Section I.C.2. states that ``the company is allowed to conduct decoking operations at each process heater
not more than 72 hours in each calendar quarter.'' However, the modeling demonstration appears to have based the decoking
emissions on operations restricted to 72 hours per year. The restriction in the order must reflect the same operating
hours as the attainment demonstration (72 hours per year). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On page 10, Section I.C.4.a.2. limits the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the refinery gas to no more than 162 ppm as
an average for any consecutive 3-hour period. In the order, this limit does not apply during ``periods of startup,
shutdown, breakdown, maintenance and repair of the fuel gas amine system, SRU1, SRU2, the tailgas recovery unit (SCOT),
the heavy distillate hydrotreater, and significant decreases in hydrogen production.'' The emissions used in the
modeled attainment demonstration for the refinery gas sources appear to be based on the hydrogen sulfide limit on
the refinery gas. Allowing exemptions to the hydrogen sulfide limit during the time periods mentioned above may jeopardize
the SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised), including Supplement A,'' dated June 1987, allows exclusion of
emissions due to malfunctions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modeling demonstration. The non-malfunction related time periods either must be removed from paragraph I.C.4.a.2.
or it must be shown that the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standards are not violated during these periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On page 28, Section VI.D., the order states that ``no facility shall be permitted to operate if it experiences an
unreasonable breakdown frequency of control equipment.'' This provision is unenforceable and must be removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On page 29, Section VI.G., references to more stringent requirements must be removed. The final sentence should
read ``To the extent that any Federal or State statute, rule, permit, order, stipulation agreement, consent decree
or schedule of compliance now in force or subsequently issued imposes limits and requires actions additional to those
required in this Order, the Company shall comply with the additional requirements of the Federal or State statute,
rule, permit, order, stipulation agreement, consent decree, or schedule of compliance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A recent USEPA enforcement inspection of the facility showed that a bypass route is available for emissions from
the sulfur reduction units 1 and 2. When the bypass is utilized, emissions do not go through the tail gas unit or the incinerator
and are not monitored. There is no information in the order or the technical support which discusses potential emissions,
the reason for bypass, or frequency of use of this bypass route. It is reasonable to expect that the short-term SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) may be in jeopardy during bypass operations. Information must be provided
which demonstrates that the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS are not violated when using the bypass associated with the sulfur reduction units. The information must include
why bypass routes are used, the frequency of use, and the associated sulfur emissions. In addition, bypass information
must be included in the notification requirements listed under Section V.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) In Exhibit 2, Section E.1., should be entitled ``Sources not subject to New Source Performance Standards.'' Also,
in Section E.1.a.1. and 2, should state the testing capacity may be ``specified by the MPCA and/or USEPA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 172 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Air Quality Control Region 131 is designated as a nonattainment area for the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide. As a
result, sulfur dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of Subpart I of Part D of Subchapter I of the Clean Air Act, particularly
Section 172(c). Guidance on the requirements of Section 172 is given in the General Preamble for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; Proposed Rule; published April 16, 1992 at 57 FR 13498.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(1) states that plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACT). The General Preamble
states that ``the definition of RACT for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS.'' Minnesota's submittal includes air dispersion
modeling designed to show that, when the comments are adequately addressed, the area will achieve attainment of the
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented, and therefore satisfy the RACT requirement of Section 172(c)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress''
is defined in Section 171(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as
are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date.'' These measures are not applicable because the Administrative Order
ensures attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by February 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions was included in the submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the SIP must be expressly identified
and quantified. Zero growth margin was provided for in the submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source
permitting program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonattainment areas was approved on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21939). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. The Administrative
Order provides emission limitations, operating requirements, and compliance schedules. When the concerns identified
previously in this action are adequately addressed, the plan will then demonstrate, through air dispersion modeling,
that the fully implemented control measures achieve attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of Section 110(a)(2). Principal among the requirements of Section 110(a)(2)
are requirements that the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA
Commissioner has certified that the public hearing was noticed on November 9, 1992, and was held on December 15, 1992.
Section 172(c)(8) states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling emission inventory, and
planning procedures. MPCA did not seek this authorization.

orders also contain reporting requirements necessary to determine compliance. Given this information, it has been
determined that the submittal contains appropriate contingency measures.

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA is proposing to disapprove the Minnesota SIP revision for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the St. Paul Park/Ashland area of AQCR 131. However, if the above comments, detailed in this action, are adequately
addressed in revisions to this plan, and those revisions are submitted to USEPA by the end of the 30-day comment period,
then, assuming no other substantive adverse public comments are received, USEPA intends to publish a direct final
rulemaking approving the SIP revision as a whole including the supplemental submittal. If, at the end of the 30-day
comment period, the issues are still unresolved, final rulemaking disapproving the SIP revision will be promulgated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments
received by October 3, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this action remains classified
as Table 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA's disapproval of the State request under Section 110 and Subchapter I, Part D of the CAA does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remaining in place after this
disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's
disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not
remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) are proposing
changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to require contractors to provide all material for performing
Government contracts, except when Government-furnished material is necessary to achieve significant economy,
standardization, or expedited production, or when it is otherwise in the Government's interest. Also, material
to be furnished by the Government shall be listed in the contract. This regulatory action was not subject to Office
of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.

The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because only a small amount of all Government-furnished material by acquisition cost is accountable to contracts
with small business and other interested parties. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not
been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities
concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be

Property'' and ``Use on No-Charge Basis_Government Facilities, Special Test Equipment and Special Tooling''.
The Government property clauses have been changed to reference the ``Schedule of Government-Furnished Property''
clause. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive
Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993.

As part of the Defense Management Review, the DARC reviewed regulatory text and clauses at the component level of the
military departments for possible elimination or combination into higher level regulations. Based on that review,
two clauses are recommended for inclusion into the FAR, Schedule of Government-Furnished Property and Use on No-Charge-Basis_Government
Facilities, Special Test Equipment and Special Tooling. The first clause will be used by contracting officers to
describe the items of Government-furnished property to be provided to the contractor, and the second clause will
authorize for the contractor's use on a no-charge basis, Government facilities, special test equipment and special
tooling. These clauses provide controls on the use of Government property by identifying the items of property furnished
under a contract or used on a no-charge basis, and the clauses also describe the obligations of both parties in regard
to the property.

This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the clauses identify and authorize property for use by the contractor which is mutually beneficial to both
parties and do not burden the contractor. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed.
However, comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Such comments must be submitted
separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), announces
a 1-year finding on a petition to add the Pacific coast population of the cactus wren (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. After a review of all available scientific and commercial information,
the Service determines that listing is not warranted at this time and hereby transfers the petitioned entity from
category 2 to category 3B of the Candidate Notice of Review. The Service concludes that the cactus wrens occupying
coastal southern California do not constitute a distinct population segment. Therefore, the Service concludes
that the Pacific coast population of the cactus wren is not a listable entity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, the Service is required to make a finding within 12 months of the date of the
receipt of a petition to revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants on whether the petition
is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded for immediate proposal by other proposals of higher
priority. Section 4(b)(3)(C) requires that petitions for which the requested action is found to be ``warranted but
precluded'' should be treated as though resubmitted on the date of such finding. Therefore, a subsequent finding
should be made within 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 21, 1990, the Service received petitions from the San Diego Biodiversity Project and Palomar Audubon
Society to list the ``San Diego cactus wren'', 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as an endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. The San Diego cactus wren, as described, occurs from San
Juan Creek in southern Orange County through western San Diego County southward to Valle de las Palmas in Baja California,
which is just south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and Nomenclature (Committee) did not recognize
the San Diego cactus wren (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a subspecies of the cactus wren (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Committee has concluded that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is intermediate between

, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service considers the Committee to be the recognized authority on the taxonomy of the birds of North America. Since
the conclusion of the committee is that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 likely only represents an intermediate form between two recognized subspecies of cactus wren, it is not currently
under consideration for addition to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 22, 1991, the Service announced its 90-day finding on the petitions (56 FR 12146), and indicated that we would
treat the petitions to list 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. sandiegensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a petition to list the coastal population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because the cactus wrens residing in coastal California may be disjunct from other cactus wrens, and may constitute
a distinct vertebrate population segment that could qualify for listing under the Act. Under section 3(15) of the
Act the term ``species'' includes any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish and wildlife
which interbreeds when mature. Thus, we indicated that the petition had presented substantial information indicating
that the requested action may be warranted. Based upon our reevaluation of information received, the Service concludes
that the coastal population of cactus wren consists of Pacific coastal portions of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. bryanti
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Congressional intent indicates that the Service is to list populations only ``sparingly''. In determining
the appropriateness of listing a vertebrate population segment under the Act, the Service considers available scientific
evidence regarding the population's discreetness or distinctiveness and regarding the population's significance
to the species as a whole.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cactus wren is a resident species, and numbers of cactus wrens residing in coastal sage scrub of coastal southern
California have declined as a result of the expressed effects of many of the same factors that have similarly impacted
the largely sympatric, threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All of the published literature on the status of coastal sage scrub vegetation types in California supports the
conclusion that this plant community is one of the most depleted habitat types in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is currently evident that the cactus wrens residing in coastal sage scrub plant communities are not distinct
from other cactus wrens. Therefore, cactus wrens occupying coastal southern California do not constitute a distinct
vertebrate population segment. For instance, although the coastal birds almost always nest in cactus, cactus is
a preferred nesting substrate of cactus wrens elsewhere in California and in the remainder of the species' range in
the United States. Perhaps more importantly, no apparent morphological or other morphometric differences have
been detected to date that distinguish coastal birds from other cactus wrens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is apparent that the habitat preference of coastal birds 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
(coastal sage scrub) does not readily separate them from other members of the subspecies. Several treatments exist
describing various types of scrub communities in southern California and Baja California. The coastal sage scrub
plant formation grades into coastal succulent scrub and eventually into Sonoran desert scrub. Although some gaps
in the range of the species may exist, birds representing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. bryanti 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. b. couesi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as currently defined by the American Ornithologist's Union (R. Banks, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1994), likely occupy all of these ``scrub'' plant communities or formations. Hence, because cactus wrens evidently
occupy several plant communities and are not isolated in habitat, the Service concludes that providing protection
pursuant to the Act for birds living in some (but not all) of these plant communities and habitats is inappropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the cactus wrens occupying coastal southern California are not likely significant to the continued
existence of a species that occurs in portions of southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
and Texas, in the United States, and mainland Mexico. The species is relatively common throughout much of its range.
However, since the birds occupying coastal southern California are not distinct, the issue of significance need
not be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This finding announced herein is not intended to discount the importance of the coastal sage scrub ecosystem in southern
California, which is the subject of intense multispecies and ecosystem planning efforts that have been undertaken
and endorsed by the Service; the Secretary of Interior; the Resources Agency, State of California; the California
Department of Fish and Game; numerous local governments; citizens' groups; and individual citizens. Cactus wrens
living in coastal southern California have declined in numbers, and coastal sage scrub habitats are becoming increasingly
depleted. Efforts to conserve these depleted habitats will be of benefit to cactus wrens residing in coastal southern
California, Federal candidate species, and other sensitive species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of sufficient evidence that a listable entity exists, the Service concludes that it is appropriate
to transfer the ``coastal population of the cactus wren'' from category 2 candidate status to category 3B. Category
3B species are taxa that, on the basis of current taxonomic understanding, do not represent distinct taxa, including
vertebrate populations, meeting the Act's definition of ``species.'' Such taxa could be reevaluated in the future
on the basis of new information. In that regard, the service will continue to accept information on the taxonomy and
distinctness of cactus wren taxa and the significance of the Pacific coast population segment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 8, 1994, NMFS proposed listing Umpqua River cutthroat trout as endangered under the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) (59 FR 35089). Department of Commerce ESA implementing regulations state that the Secretary of Commerce ``shall
promptly hold at least one public hearing if any person so requests within 45 days of publication of a proposed regulation
to list.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.a species'' (50 CFR 424.16 (c)(3)). A public hearing on the proposed listing provides
the opportunity for the public to give comments and to permit an exchange of information and opinion among interested
parties. In response to a request by the Douglas Timber Operators, Inc. for a public hearing, NMFS announces that a
hearing on the proposed listing of the Umpqua River cutthroat trout will be held from 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Thursday,
September 29, 1994, at the Timber/Indian Rooms of the Campus Center at the Umpqua Community College. The Umpqua Community
College is located on College Way Road, Winchester, OR, and is approximately 7 miles north of Roseburg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original public comment period for the proposed listing of Umpqua River cutthroat trout was scheduled to close
on September 6, 1994. To ensure that the public is provided adequate opportunity to comment on the proposed listing,
and in order to accept public comment after the public hearing, NMFS is extending the ongoing public comment period
for 30 additional days. The extended public comment period for the proposed rule to list Umpqua River cutthroat trout
as endangered will conclude October 6, 1994. Written comments should be sent to the address below.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals engaged in such activities
are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged in such activities are
certified. This proposed rule would also establish standards for performing lead-based paint activities and require
that all lead-based paint activities be performed by certified individuals. When promulgated, the rule would fulfil
the mandate of section 402 (a)(1) of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Additionally, as part of this
proposed rule, EPA has, in accordance with section 404(d) of TSCA, developed a proposed Model State Program. When
promulgated, this program may be adopted by any State that seeks to administer and enforce a State program under Title
IV of TSCA.

EPA is issuing this proposed rule under the authority of section 402 and 404 of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) (15 U.S.C. 2682 and 2684.). Section 402(a) of TSCA directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based
paint activities. Section 404(a) of TSCA requires that any State that seeks to administer and enforce the requirements
established by the Agency under section 402 or 406 of TSCA must submit to the Administrator of EPA, in such form as the
Administrator shall require, a request for authorization of such a program. Section 406 of TSCA requires EPA to publish
and from time-to-time revise, a lead hazard information pamphlet and to publish regulations requiring the distribution
of such pamphlet. The requirements of section 406 are being developed in a separate rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this regulation is to address the nation's need for a qualified and properly trained workforce to
assist in the elimination of hazards associated with lead-based paint. Providing for this workforce will ensure
that individuals and firms will conduct lead-based paint activities in a way that will safeguard the environment
and protect human health, specifically, the health of building occupants (especially children under 6 years of age)
and the workers themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To successfully confront the issues associated with lead-based paint hazards at the national level will require
the involvement of many partners working together. In promulgating this regulation, EPA will be establishing the
framework required to address lead-based paint hazards. This framework will ultimately provide support for and
enhance activities currently conducted by public health officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to a support system for public health officials, a suitable infrastructure is needed for other mandates
of TSCA Title IV. These mandates include the promulgation of regulations for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards
in real estate transactions, and the development of a pamphlet to educate the public on potential hazards associated
with renovation and remodeling activities. Activities such as these increase public awareness of the hazards of
lead-based paint, resulting in the need for a workable regulatory infrastructure to respond to the public's concerns.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency recognizes the nation's public health communities as powerful contributors in support of the program
outlined in this proposed regulation. Through the collective efforts of public health communities to address childhood
lead poisoning in areas such as blood-lead screening and case management, and EPA, through the identification and
control of lead-based paint hazards, the goal of preventing the poisoning of children from lead-based paint will
be realized nationwide.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 28, 1992, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (``Title X'') became law. The purposes
of Title X include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. To develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in
all housing as expeditiously as possible.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. To reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint in housing to implement, on a priority basis,
a broad program to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation's housing stock.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. To encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable framework for lead-based
paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 amended TSCA by adding a new Title IV. Several sections
of Title X direct EPA to promulgate regulations aimed at fulfilling the purposes of the Title X. These include TSCA
section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, which directs EPA to promulgate a final regulation
to govern the training and certification of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities, the accreditation
of training programs and standards for conducting lead-based paint activities; and section 404, Authorized State
Programs, which provides that any State may seek to administer and enforce the requirements established by the Agency
under sections 402 and 406. This proposed rule addresses both sections 402(a) and 404(d). Rules to address the requirements
of other sections of TSCA Title IV (e.g. sections 403 and 406), are being proposed separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Independently, these other sections of TSCA Title IV will support the overriding objectives of Title X. For example,
a required information dissemination program to inform the public of lead-based paint hazards in the home has been
proposed under section 406. Section 403 health-based standards will be developed and promulgated to provide the
basis for identifying hazardous levels of lead in dust, soil, and paint. Studies to determine whether renovation
and remodelling activities may pose a lead-based paint hazard, as well as studies to determine the efficiencies of
various abatement technologies are also being conducted under section 402(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the interrelated nature of the various sections of TSCA Title IV, EPA has developed and proposed a subpart A to
40 CFR part 745 which would serve as a reference point for the terms and provisions common to each of the regulations
to be promulgated under Title IV. Later in this preamble these other sections of Title IV and their relevance to today's
proposal will be discussed in more detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before it began the development of this proposed rule, EPA informally met with a broad range of interested parties
to solicit information on the subject of lead-based paint activities training, accreditation, certification,
and standards. In addition, the Agency received written comments from dozens of individuals, firms, organizations
and States, all of whom have provided their own perspective on Title X. Additionally, while the Agency continued to
meet informally with interested groups and review written comments, the Society for Occupational and Environmental
Health (SOEH) held a series of workshops with experts in the worker protection and training arena as participants.
Following the workshops, SOEH drafted and submitted to the Agency its recommendations for effective worker protection
during lead-based paint activities. The Agency has included the SOEH document and all other written comments, and
written summaries of meetings in the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is grateful to all who took the time to provide information, ideas, and suggestions. Over the last several
months, the Agency has carefully reviewed and considered all of this input. While not all points of view were incorporated
in the proposed rule, this proposal reflects many of the thoughts and viewpoints of these interested parties.

IV. Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Lead-Based Paint Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation deals with the broad category of lead-based paint activities. The term lead-based paint
activities is defined by section 402(b) of TSCA to mean: (1) In the case of target housing _ risk assessment, inspection,
and abatement; and (2) in the case of any public building constructed before 1978, commercial building, bridge, or
other structure or superstructure _ identification of lead-based paint and materials containing lead-based paint,
deleading, removal of lead from bridges, and demolition. For the purposes of this definition, the term ``deleading''
means activities conducted by a person who offers to eliminate lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards or to
plan such activities. Abatement, as defined in section 401 of TSCA, essentially means any set of measures designed
to eliminate lead-based paint hazards permanently. The definition of abatement in the proposed rule is intended
to include activities performed by those individuals, who by design or intent, perform lead abatement as defined
by TSCA Title IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that this proposed regulation would not require any person to abate lead-based paint, or to inspect
for the presence of lead-based paint. Rather, it would establish requirements and procedures applicable to individuals
and firms responsible for making a determination of the presence of lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards
and identifying control strategies to address these hazards. If a decision is made to conduct an abatement, this regulation
would provide standards and procedures for conducting the abatement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress, in Title X, has purposefully excluded renovation and remodeling activities from the regulation's definition
of abatement. Section 402(c)(2) of TSCA requires the Agency to conduct a study to assist in determining the extent
to which persons engaged in specific renovation and remodeling activities in target housing, pre-1978 public buildings,
and commercial buildings are exposed to lead or create lead hazards in the conduct of such activities. Section 402(c)(2)
requires that this study be completed by April 28, 1995. Based on the results of this study and other information collected,
the regulation being proposed today must be amended by October 28, 1996, to apply only to certain renovation and remodeling
activities that - according to the section 402(c)(2) study and in consultation with labor organizations, contractors,
and experts in lead health effects create a lead-based paint hazard. As part of today's proposed rule, the Agency is
soliciting any available data that might be helpful in defining the risks posed to workers and/or building occupants
during typical renovation and remodeling activities. This information will assist the Agency in the required rule
revision. EPA recommends that States that are currently developing legislation for a State lead program consider
including legislative authority for the future regulation of renovation and remodeling activities within the scope
of the revised EPA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the scope of this proposed regulation covers abatement activities as a means of controlling lead-based
paint hazards, the Agency does not wish to suggest that total abatement is the only option for controlling these hazards.
A wide variety of effective hazard control measures can be utilized. In a particular dwelling, it is possible that
a variety of control strategies (e.g., encapsulation, enclosure, component replacement) may need to be utilized
to address all of the lead-based paint hazards identified by the risk assessor. Complete abatement is not always the
best or most appropriate response to address lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Homeowners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title IV of TSCA does not specifically address whether the regulatory requirements developed for lead abatement
contractors under section 402 are also intended to apply to individual homeowners who conduct lead-based paint activities
within their own dwelling units. The Agency has decided that its section 402 rules should apply to all individuals
and firms conducting lead-based paint activities in target housing and other specifically identified categories
of buildings and structures, except persons who perform lead-based paint activities at residences which they own,
unless the residence is occupied by a person or persons other than the owner or the owner's immediate family while these
activities are being conducted. If the property is occupied by an individual that is not the owner or the owner's immediate
family, any lead-based paint activity, conducted at that time, must be conducted by a certified individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The very title of section 1021 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, indicates that the
scope and focus of this section is on training and certification requirements for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, not homeowners. Section 1021 of the 1992 Act added a new Title IV to TSCA. The new Title IV includes both section 402
(``Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification'') and 404 (``Authorized State Programs''). Significantly,
section 1021 itself is entitled ``Contractor Training and Certification.'' There is no express requirement in the
statute that homeowners doing lead-based paint activities in their homes must be trained and certified. Nor is there
any such indication in the legislative history. The section 402(a) requirement that all abatements in target housing
be performed by certified contractors has been interpreted by EPA to mean that a homeowner who hires a contractor to
do abatement in his home must hire a contractor who is certified. EPA does not interpret this requirement to mean that
uncertified homeowners cannot do their own abatements. While EPA recognizes it might be possible to draw a different
inference from the above-referenced certified contractor language of section 402(a) as it stands alone, the Agency
believes that the Congressional focus on regulating contractor activity evidenced by the reference in section 1021's
title to ``contractors'' as well as certain other language in sections 402(c)(3) and 406(b) requiring persons who
perform renovation of target housing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
for compensation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (e.g. ``contractors'') to provide safety pamphlets to owners and occupants creates enough ambiguity with respect
to Congressional intent that such an inference need not be drawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in section 402(c), as discussed earlier in this preamble, Congress recognized that more needed to be
learned about the risks from renovation and remodelling activities before subjecting such activities to regulation.
Following the completion, by April 1995, of a study of the risks created by renovation and remodelling activities,
Congress has required EPA to revise the section 402(a) regulations to apply them to those renovation and remodeling
activities which create lead hazards. In section 402(c), Congress told EPA what factors to consider ``[i]n determining
which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are engaged in such activities'' and required that, if EPA determines that ``any category of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' does not require certification, EPA shall publish an explanation. Again, because of the fact that the Statute specifically
mentions ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
contractors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and not ``homeowners,'' it is EPA's interpretation of section 402(c)(3) that Congress' focus was on the need to
regulate contractors doing renovation and remodeling activities, and not homeowners doing renovation and remodeling
of their own homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA assumes that in writing section 402(c), Congress did not direct that homeowners ultimately be regulated under
section 402(a) because Congress never intended homeowners doing abatements in their own homes to be covered by section
402(a) in the first place. Indeed, homeowners working in their own homes are more likely to be engaged in the sort of
activities described in the definition of ``interim controls,'' which activities require neither training nor
certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA recognizes that the universe of potentially regulated entities is broader than just contractors and homeowners
doing their own abatements, EPA has decided to exclude only the latter category of individuals from the scope of these
regulations. EPA has chosen to draft this exclusion narrowly because it recognizes the potential health and environmental
hazards that could result from improperly performed abatements and wants to minimize such hazards. However, EPA
invites comment on the scope of this exclusion as drafted and specifically on whether other categories of individuals
or groups (e.g. renters abating their own apartments or volunteer organizations that do renovation work) should
also be excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is, however, concerned about the potential exposures to lead which an untrained and uncertified homeowner may
cause to himself/herself and other family members as a result of work done. As a result of this concern, EPA strongly
encourages States to consider whether they wish to use their own legal authority to regulate work done by the homeowner.
For example, States may wish to consider the inclusion of standards for lead-based paint activities in appropriate
building codes. This approach could mirror other State and local regulatory programs already used to control other
work done in homes such as electrical and plumbing work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to encouraging States to consider programs with the authority to regulate homeowners, EPA plans an aggressive
awareness campaign directed at homeowners. This program will include not only the design and distribution of informational
materials, but the Agency also intends to develop seminars to alert homeowners to the potential hazards associated
with lead-based paint activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Building Types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In defining lead-based paint activities, section 402(b) of TSCA categorized target housing singly, and public buildings,
commercial buildings, and superstructures (e.g., bridges and watertowers) together. Lead-based paint activities
conducted in target housing are identified in 402(b) as risk assessment, inspection, and abatement. For public buildings,
commercial buildings, and superstructures, 402(b) defines lead-based paint activities as: the identification
of lead-based paint and materials containing lead-based paint; deleading; removal of lead from bridges; and demolition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to group public building and target housing activities together as one category, and to group
commercial building and superstructure activities together as a second category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Target housing is defined in the proposed regulation and in section 1004 of Title X to mean ``any housing constructed
prior to 1978 except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years
of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0-bedroom
dwelling.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public buildings are not defined under Title X. EPA is proposing to define a public building as any building built before
1978, that is generally open to the public or occupied or visited by children. For example schools, daycare centers,
museums, airports, hospitals, stores, convention centers, and federal and other government facilities are all
considered to be public buildings. It should be noted that all federal facilities, regardless of whether they are
target housing, public buildings, commercial building, or steel structures are specifically covered under this
regulation, as directed by TSCA section 408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to define a commercial building as any building used primarily for commercial or industrial activity,
which is generally not open to the public, or occupied or visited by children, including but not limited to, warehouses,
factories, storage facilities, aircraft hangers, garages, and wholesale distribution facilities. Under TSCA,
section 402(b) the only example of a superstructure listed is a bridge, but drawing on the common meaning of superstructure,
EPA is proposing to include other structures such as watertowers, aboveground storage tanks, oil refineries, utility
and other structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's determination to group target housing and public buildings together is based on two factors. One factor
is that the potential for lead exposure in a public building setting, such as a museum, school, or daycare center, is
similar to the potential for lead exposure to children in target housing, where families and children reside. Consequently,
EPA is proposing standards for lead-based paint activities in public buildings that have the same degree of protectiveness
as those for target housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second factor in EPA's decision to propose separate categories is due to differences in the structural design
and building materials that are commonly used in target housing/public buildings and those used in commercial buildings/superstructures.
For example, the structural design and building materials (e.g., wallboard, ceiling tiles, flooring materials,
wooden doorways, and window frames) found in public buildings are often similar to those found in target housing.
Commercial buildings and superstructures, on the other hand, typically are constructed of metal, such as structural
steel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work practices for the conduct of lead-based paint activities also differ for the aforementioned categories. The
building materials in commercial buildings and superstructures require work practices for deleading activities
that are very different than activities associated with lead abatement in target housing or public buildings. For
example, the deleading of a watertower or industrial warehouse calls for sophisticated rigging and scaffolding
equipment and the erection of containment structures. These methods are not applicable to the abatement of lead-based
paint in target housing or public buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these differences, as well as information supplied by the professional community on deleading steel structures
and commercial buildings, the Agency believes there is little crossover between workers practicing in the target
housing/public buildings realm and those in the commercial building/steel structures realm. Rather, evidence
suggests that individuals are either working in the abatement of target housing and public buildings, or in the deleading
of commercial buildings and steel structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In drafting this proposal, the Agency considered information provided by several professional groups whose members
perform work in commercial buildings and superstructures. Based on this information, it appears that a broader range
of tasks are practiced by fewer categories of individuals working these structures. Consequently only two accreditation
disciplines (supervisor and worker) have been established for individuals working in commercial buildings and
superstructures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposal would establish the following certification disciplines: inspector technician, inspector/risk
assessor, supervisor, planner/project designer, and worker for target housing and public buildings; and supervisor
and worker for commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing standards for lead-based paint activities in three separate categories of facilities. These
categories include target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and superstructures. In target
housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public
buildings, covers the identification of lead-based paint and lead-containing materials, risk assessment, abatement,
and demolition. The final set of standards are for identification, deleading, and demolition in commercial buildings
and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is requesting comment on its proposed definition of public buildings and its proposal to regulate them
in a fashion similar to target housing. Specifically, the Agency is interested in comment on whether the universe
of building types covered under the proposed definition of public buildings comprise the appropriate range of building
types. Further, the Agency is interested in comment on an alternative strategy that would decrease the number of public
building types that should be regulated in a fashion similar to target housing.

D. Section 403 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the Lead-Based Paint Exposure Reduction Act, sections 402 and 404 represent just two of the many mandates
that EPA is working under to address the issue of lead exposure. Section 403 of TSCA is one of these other mandates. That
section requires that the Agency shall ``. . .promulgate regulations which shall identify. . .lead-based paint hazards,
lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil.'' The section 403 regulations will represent EPA's determination
of those conditions that cause exposure to lead in paint, residential soil, and dust that would result in adverse human
health effects. EPA expects the findings of this rule will be one of the most widely used tools to assist persons who
will make the decisions on whether and how to reduce risk from lead-based paint, soil, and dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title IV established the same 18&hyph;month deadline for promulgation of the section 403 rule as for the rules under
sections 402 and 404. At this time, the Agency is still developing its proposed regulation under section 403. While
the 403 rule, when promulgated, will be important for the lead exposure reduction program, it must be emphasized that
it is essentially a source of guidance for the decisionmaker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is in contrast to today's proposed rule under sections 402 and 404, which is an infrastructure and ``how to'' type
of rule. When promulgated, today's proposal will develop an infrastructure of training, certification, and standards
for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The 403 rule will identify conditions resulting in adverse
human health effects which may be eliminated pursuant to the standards and requirements contained in the 402 and 404
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When promulgated, the section 403 rule will be an important part of the federal lead exposure reduction program. However,
it should be noted that the absence of the proposed section 403 rule at this time does not, in the Agency's opinion, significantly
impair the public's ability to meaningfully comment on today's proposal. This is because the identification at a
later date in the section 403 rule levels of lead that would result in adverse human health effects, is not expected
to have a significant impact on the development of the standards and requirements of this proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the procedures established in proposed &sect;745.228(b)(4) of the regulatory text for the conduct
of dust sampling as a part of a risk assessment in target housing are not expected to change as a function of the level
established for lead-contaminated dust under the section 403 rule. Similarly, the number of course hours needed
to properly train a risk assessor would probably not change due to the establishment of a particular definition of
``lead-based paint hazard'' under the section 403 regulation. In summary, the Agency believes that the standards
and requirements proposed in the 402 and 404 rules can be evaluated independently of the definitions to be proposed
in the future under section 403. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently, the Agency published guidance on residential lead-based paint, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated
soil. This guidance is intended to be used to prioritize primary prevention activities that address hazards from
lead in and around residences. EPA expects that these hazards will be among those that will be identified when regulations
are issued under section 403. The levels and conditions described in this guidance should be used by decisionmakers'
to identify lead-based paint hazards, sources of lead exposure, and the need for control actions in residential environments
where children may be present.

V. Accreditation of Training Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of TSCA requires EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities
to ensure, among other items, that training programs for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities are
accredited. Section 402(a)(2) states that these accreditation regulations must contain specific requirements
for the accreditation of lead-based paint activities training programs for workers, supervisors, inspectors and
planners, and other individuals involved in lead-based paint activities. These requirements must include, at least:
(1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training providers, (2) minimum training curriculum requirements,
(3) minimum training hour requirements, (4) minimum hands-on training requirements, (5) minimum trainee competency
and proficiency requirements, and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. Proposed &sect;745.225,
Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Training Programs, describes a Federal accreditation program that
EPA believes meets these requirements. Once the final rule is promulgated, &sect;745.225 may be used by States, as
defined by section 3 of TSCA as a model for purposes of establishing their own accreditation and certification programs
in the context of applying for authorization under section 404 of Title IV of TSCA. The procedures for State program
authorization are addressed in subpart Q of the regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Framework for Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed &sect;745.225(a), training programs may be accredited to offer courses for the following disciplines:
Inspector technician, inspector/risk assessor, supervisor, planner/project designer, and worker for target
housing and public buildings; and supervisor and worker for commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Discipline'' means a specific type or category of lead-based paint activity. For example, an ``inspector technician
for target housing and public buildings'' would be a discipline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The course content, as well as the tasks associated with these job disciplines, are based principally on the definition
of lead-based paint activities under TSCA, Title IV, as well as numerous comments the Agency received from practitioners
in the field regarding the tasks associated with lead-based paint activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following represents the categories, and respective roles and responsibilities for each discipline as proposed
in this regulation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Target Housing and Public Buildings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspector technicians
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Conducting an inspection for lead-based paint in target housing and in public buildings;
(2) completing an inspection report; and (3) taking post-abatement soil and dust clearance samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspector/risk assessors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for all of the same activities as the inspector technician, as well as: (1) Conducting a risk assessment
and other lead hazard assessment activities (such as screening a residence for lead hazards) in target housing and
in public buildings; (2) completing a risk assessment report; (3) interpreting the results of inspections, and assessments;
(4) identifying hazard control strategies to reduce or eliminate lead exposures; and (5) conducting post-abatement
soil and dust clearance sampling and evaluating the results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Workers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: Conducting abatement activities in accordance with the procedures and requirements of
the pre-abatement plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Supervisors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that abatement activities are conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements;
(2) in projects involving the abatement of less than 10 units, developing a written pre-abatement plan and an abatement
report for each assigned unit; (3) maintaining accessibility at all times when abatement activities are being conducted;
and (4) ensuring completion of all abatement activities according to the standards of this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Planners/project designers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Designing abatement projects for target housing buildings with 10 or more units, and
all projects in public buildings; (2) preparation of a pre-abatement plan for all designed projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial Buildings and Steel Structures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Workers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: Conducting deleading activities in accordance with the procedures and requirements of
the deleading plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Supervisors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that deleading activities are conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements;
(2) developing a written deleading plan and a post-abatement report for each assigned abatement project; (3) maintaining
accessibility at all times when deleading activities are being conducted; (4) ensuring completion of all deleading
activities according to the standards of this regulation; (5) identifying lead-based paint; and (6) completing
all other reports required under this regulation. In the statute, activities associated with the inspection and
assessment of lead-based paint are clustered together, and the Agency originally envisioned that it would develop
one job discipline to both inspect for the presence of lead-based paint and to evaluate or assess any lead hazards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comments to the Agency, however, contractors performing work in large buildings (i.e., apartment complexes,
schools, etc.) indicated that the costs associated with requirements mandating that individuals conducting inspections
also be required to be trained to conduct risk assessments (as defined by the statute) were overly burdensome. Other
commenters suggested utilizing individuals with less skill, education and training to simply collect the data needed
by a ``risk assessor'' to evaluate lead hazards. Thus, in large settings the work could be done at a significantly lower
cost while not compromising the quality of either the inspection or risk assessment. Based on these comments, the
Agency is proposing the ``inspector technician'' discipline and the ``inspector/risk assessor'' discipline.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of two distinct disciplines _ one as an entry level position, the ``inspector technician,'' who
would only conduct inspections; and another more advanced position, the ``inspector/risk assessor,'' who would
conduct risk assessments, but who also could conduct inspections _ also will enable individuals to logically progress
in their profession. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To foster this progression, the Agency is proposing to structure the inspector technician course so that it may be
taken as a distinct course, separate from the inspector/risk assessor course. Upon passage of the inspector technician
course, an individual would be able to secure certification as an inspector technician. Once certified as an inspector
technician, an individual would be able to gain the work experience necessary to take the inspector/risk assessor
course and to become certified as an inspector/risk assessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, individuals that already possess the experience and/or education requirements to become certified
as an inspector/risk assessor would take the inspector technician training course and the inspector/risk assessor
training course together as one unit. Upon completion of the unit, individuals would become eligible for certification
as an inspector/risk assessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By structuring the two courses in this way, the Agency also has avoided unnecessary duplication in training courses
which individuals seeking to advance their careers sometimes encounter when taking additional training for other
certifications. The content of the proposed inspector/risk assessor course supplements the inspector technician
course and would not repeat any of the material from the inspector technician course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another example of this approach can be seen in the supervisor and planner/project designer training courses. An
individual could become certified as a supervisor for target housing and public buildings or as a planner/project
designer for target housing and public buildings. However, to become certified as a planner/project designer, an
individual would take the supervisor course and the planner/project designer course as one unit. Individuals seeking
certification as a supervisor would only take the supervisor course, but could take the segment on planning/project
design at a later date if they chose to pursue certification as a planner/project designer. Once again, the planner/project
designer course would supplement the supervisor course and would not repeat any of the material from the supervisor
course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency received comments from a number of interested parties in reference to the need to avoid duplicative training.
In response, the Agency considered taking a modular approach by specifying a core curriculum that would be common
to all the categories of individuals conducting lead-based paint activities. However, EPA's review of the training
requirements indicates that the only knowledge and skill elements common to all the categories are: background information
on lead, health effects, and regulatory background. Because these elements would only make up one-half day of training,
the Agency believes it is not practical to break out these topics as a separate core curriculum. Consequently, the
Agency has proposed separate courses for each discipline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency invites specific comments on its chosen approach and suggestions for outlining a modular approach
that could be practicably implemented. Currently, the regulation requires a minimum amount of classroom time for
each course (e.g. the inspector technician course shall last a minimum of 24 hours). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency feels that the advantages of classroom training (opportunity for student teacher interaction,
the ability of the training provider to update or customize the course material delivery at the time of the course)
are significant, the Agency also is interested and requests comment on less traditional educational methods. These
alternative methods could include the use of videotape or at-home study, for the delivery of the course material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One such alternative would allow individuals to study course materials at home, and then spend one or two days at a training
program facility to receive hands-on instruction and to take the course exam. This alternative would help to reduce
travel expenses, may lower tuition costs, and would reduce the time that a trainee would have to miss work. The Agency
is concerned however that non-classroom oriented instructional methods may not provide training of a quality equivalent
to classroom instruction. Comments on the impact of quality resulting from alternative training methods taking
into account the requirement for hands-on training, course test, and third party exam, are specifically sought as
a part of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Application Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(a) describes the process a training program must follow when applying for accreditation
from an approving authority. ``Approving authority'' is defined in this proposed regulation to mean EPA or in the
case of a State or Tribal program authorized by EPA under this proposal, the appropriate State agency or Tribal authority;
an ``accredited training program'' means a training program that has been accredited by an approving authority to
provide training for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures in proposed &sect;745.225(a) would apply to all training programs seeking accreditation, regardless
of when they began offering lead training. After the effective date of &sect;745.225, only accredited training programs
may offer lead-based paint activity training for individuals seeking certification under proposed &sect;745.226.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a training program to be accredited, the program would have to submit an application and all of the documents and
information listed in proposed &sect;745.225(a)(2) to the approving authority. These documents would be used by
the approving authority to determine if the training program meets the minimum requirements for accreditation of
training programs listed in proposed &sect;745.225(b). Training programs also would be required to maintain copies
of all documents submitted with their application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documents to be submitted as a part of the application would include a written statement signed by the training program
manager that clearly demonstrates that the training program meets the requirements outlined in &sect;745.225(b).
The training manager would be responsible for ensuring that the training program complies with all requirements
in proposed &sect;745.225(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training manager must also certify that all of the program's principal instructor(s) and work practice instructor(s)
meet the specified experience requirements and ensure satisfactory performance of the program instructors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the program's instructor/student manuals and the course agenda for each course must also be submitted with
the application for accreditation. However, if the training program chooses to utilize EPA-developed model course
materials, they would not be required to submit these materials, but only to maintain them. This exclusion is not intended
to favor the use of EPA-developed materials, but to minimize the documentation that a training program must submit,
and thus to minimize the paperwork burden generated by the application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the training program's application for accreditation is submitted, the approving authority would have 180
days to approve or disapprove the application. The approving authority may, at its discretion, work with training
programs to address inadequacies in the request for accreditation. If a training program's application is disapproved,
the program may reapply at any time. If a training program's application is approved, a certificate of accreditation
would be sent to the applicant. A training program may offer basic full length training courses and refresher training
courses in as many disciplines as it chooses, but would be required to seek accreditation for each discipline. However,
a training program cannot apply for accreditation to teach a refresher course unless it is accredited to teach the
full length basic course. A training program may apply for accreditation to teach both the full length basic training
course and the refresher training courses simultaneously. Procedures to apply for accreditation to teach a refresher
training course are discussed in unit V.F. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a training program to obtain accreditation for any of the courses, the program would have to demonstrate it meets
the requirements detailed in proposed &sect;745.225(b). The proposed requirements have been developed to ensure
that all accredited training programs are offering similar high quality training courses, regardless of where the
training programs are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training program would have to employ a qualified training manager, principal instructor(s), and work practice
instructor(s) and would have the necessary facilities to teach both the lecture and hands-on portion of the course(s)
for which the program would be seeking accreditation. Proposed &sect;745.225(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) lists the
education and experience requirements that the Agency believes training managers, principal instructors, and
work practice instructors would have to possess to ensure that training is conducted properly. Documents that would
serve as a proof of these educational requirements are identified in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(5). The Agency invites
specific comment on the educational and work experience requirements it is proposing for training program managers
and course instructors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training manager is responsible for the overall quality of the training program from the qualifications of the
instructors to the adequacy of the training facility. They are responsible for certifying, in the program application,
that the program meets all of the accreditation requirements of this regulation, and for maintaining the program
at that level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal instructor is responsible for the organization, delivery and oversight of all course materials. In
this capacity the principal instructor has the flexibility to bring in experts (e.g. doctors or lawyers) to teach
selected portions of the training course (e.g., health effects of lead or regulatory requirements). These experts,
termed ``guest instructors,'' might not be professional trainers or practitioners in the lead-based paint activities
arena, but must maintain specialized knowledge of a particular course topic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a part of the educational requirements for training managers, and principal and work practice instructors, the
Agency has proposed a 40&hyph;hour train-the-trainer course. The Agency chose 40 hours based on comments it has received
from a number of interested parties. On the other hand, several parties have expressed concern to the Agency that 40
hours is an extensive period of time for a train-the-trainer course. Comments on this issue are invited, as well as
the submission of supplemental information on the utility of a 40&hyph;hour course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(c) of the regulatory text lists the minimum curriculum requirements for each course. The
minimum requirements are a list of topics that would be covered in each of the courses, as well as the specified skill
areas where hands-on training would occur. There would be minimum curriculum requirements for inspector technicians,
inspector/risk assessors, supervisors, planner/project designers, and workers in target housing and public buildings;
and supervisors and workers in commercial buildings and superstructures. The training programs would also provide
instruction in the standards in proposed &sect;745.228 for conducting lead-based paint activities. The course
topics that must include a hands-on exercise are noted in the proposed rule with an asterisk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each training program's course would have to meet or exceed the appropriate minimum total training hour and hands-on
training requirements as stated in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(7) of the regulatory text. The hands-on training
hours are included in the total number of training hours. The total training hours and hands-on training hour requirements
were developed by the Agency based on its experience in developing other training programs for asbestos, pesticides,
and radon. In defining the total training hour requirements, the Agency also considered information it has received
from the EPA-sponsored Regional Lead Training Centers, private training providers, and other university-based
training providers, labor organizations, and other interested parties. The Agency is requesting that individuals
who have data that would support alternative minimum training hour requirements submit that information during
the comment period for consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure trainee competency and proficiency, the accredited training program would have to administer a course
test at the end of the course and conduct a hands-on skills assessment. The hands-on skills assessment would be an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the hands-on training which should test the ability of the trainees to demonstrate satisfactory
performance of all the specified work practices and procedures described in proposed &sect;745.225(c). Both the
hands-on assessment and the course test would have to be successfully completed to pass the course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the quality of the training programs, programs would have to develop, implement, and maintain a quality
control plan and submit the plan to the approving authority for consideration. The quality control plan should be
developed so as to maintain and improve the quality of the training program over time. The plan would address procedures
for periodic revision of training materials and the course test to reflect innovations in the field, and procedures
to periodically review instructor competency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example of why the provisions for quality control and periodic revision of course materials are important is seen
in the inspector/risk assessor course. The procedures outlined in proposed &sect;745.228(b) and (e) of the regulatory
text are critical for the conduct of risk assessments in target housing and public buildings. However, risk assessment,
or determining the nature or severity of a lead-based paint hazard is an evolving field where technologies are advancing
at rapid pace. The skills needed for assessing lead-based paint hazards would be addressed in the inspector/risk
assessor course, so provisions for quality control and the periodic revision of course materials to include state-of-the-art
advances are of the utmost importance to ensure professional competence.

E. Course Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(b)(8) outlines the requirements for the course test that would be administered by training
programs at the completion of each course. The course test would be representative of the topics taught in the course.
Although the Agency expects most training providers to develop and administer a written course test, EPA is requesting
comment on the need to make special provisions for individuals who cannot read English, or who have a low reading comprehension.
For example, training providers may want to develop a course test in a foreign language, or to administer the test orally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of how it is administered, training participants would be required to pass the course test by answering
correctly at least 70 percent of the test questions. Upon successfully passing the course test and the hands-on assessment,
individuals would receive a course completion certificate. Passage of the course test and hands-on assessment would
demonstrate that the trainee has been properly trained.

F. Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Refresher Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(d) outlines the minimum requirements that would be required for the accreditation of refresher
training programs. These requirements would ensure that all accredited training programs would offer similar high
quality refresher training courses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refresher training would address the following topics: An overview of key safety practices; an update on current
laws and regulations (Federal, State, and local); and an update on new technologies. The course would be a minimum
of 7 training hours and would include a course test to be administered at the end of the course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum course requirements for a refresher training course would serve to update an individual's knowledge
and skills so they can effectively and safely continue to practice in the field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to its application, a training program seeking accreditation to teach a refresher course(s) would submit
to the approving authority the materials to be used for the course. This information would be submitted for each discipline
for which the program will be seeking accreditation. The approving authority would have 45 days to approve or disapprove
the request for accreditation and to issue a certificate of accreditation. The approving authority may, at its discretion,
work with training programs to address inadequacies identified in the request for accreditation. If a training program's
application is disapproved, the program would be able to reapply at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A training program may offer refresher training courses in as many disciplines as it chooses, but would be required
to seek accreditation for each discipline. However, a training program cannot apply for accreditation to teach a
refresher course unless it is accredited to teach the full length basic course. A training program may apply for accreditation
to teach both refresher training courses and full length basic training courses simultaneously. Procedures to apply
for accreditation to teach a full length basic training course are discussed in paragraph C of this Unit in the preamble.

G. Re-accreditation of Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that accredited training programs continue to offer high quality training, the Agency has proposed requirements
at &sect;745.225(e) for the re-accreditation of training programs. An accredited training program would have to
be re-accredited every 3 years by the approving authority. To qualify for this re-accreditation, an audit of the training
program by the approving authority may be performed at the approving authority's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application for re-accreditation shall include a list of courses for which the training program is applying to
teach and a description of any changes or updates to the training facility or equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the application, the training program manager would sign a statement certifying that: (1) The course
materials meet the applicable curricula requirements in proposed &sect;745.225(c); (2) the training manager,
principal instructors, and work practice instructors meet the qualifications in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(1),
(b)(2), and (b)(3); (3) the training program complies at all times with all requirements in proposed &sect;745.225(b);
(4) the quality control program meets the requirements described in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(11); and (5) that
the recordkeeping requirements in proposed &sect;745.225(h) are being followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training program would submit an application for re-accreditation at least 180 days prior to expiration of its
existing accreditation. If a training program does not submit its application for re-accreditation in time, EPA
would not be able to guarantee that the application would be processed before the applicant's accreditation expires.

H. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Accredited Training Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(f) contains the procedures that the approving authority would follow to suspend, revoke,
or modify a training program's accreditation. The approving authority may, generally after notice and opportunity
for a hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify a training program's accreditation if a training program or its training
manager, or other supervisor has committed any of the acts identified in proposed &sect;745.225(f).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(g) of the regulatory text describes the procedures that the approving authority would follow
if it decides to suspend, revoke, or modify the accreditation of a training program. These include procedures for
notifying the program; for conducting the hearing, if requested; and for immediate action to suspend the accreditation
of any program.

J. Training Program Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.225(h) of the regulatory text outlines the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for accredited
training programs. The recordkeeping requirements would ensure that the approving authority could obtain the information
necessary to audit programs and ensure that approved training programs are in compliance with all applicable standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training program would maintain, and make available to the approving authority, if requested, all documents
submitted to the approving authority as listed in proposed &sect;745.225(a)(ii). In addition the training program
would maintain all documents specified in proposed &sect;745.225(b)(5) that demonstrate the qualifications of
the training manager, principal instructors, and work practice instructors. Student files also would be maintained
and would contain at a minimum, the results of the student's hands-on skills assessment and course test, and a copy
of their course completion certificate. The training program would retain these records for a minimum of 3 years and
6 months at the location and address specified on the training program accreditation application. Training programs
would notify the approving authority 30 days prior to relocating its business or transferring the records.

K. Training and Other Regulatory Requirements Applicable to Lead-Based Paint Abatement Professionals Under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the training and recordkeeping requirements of this proposed rule, there are other regulations that
may apply to individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. Some lead-based paint activities may result in
the generation of hazardous waste as defined under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). For convenience,
this paragraph includes references to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Code of Federal Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CFR) for applicable RCRA hazardous waste generator requirements (see 40 CFR part 262), as well as references to training
and recordkeeping requirements. References to training and recordkeeping requirements are specified as needed
in the following discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Individuals involved in projects that generate more than 100 kilograms/month of hazardous waste must be instructed
in hazardous waste determination and management procedures relevant to their job descriptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are also RCRA training requirements cited in 40 CFR 265.16 which are applicable to both large quantity generators
of hazardous waste (more than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous waste are generated) and operators of the RCRA treatment,
storage, and disposal facilities. Small quantity generators (more than 100 kilograms/month but less than 1,000
kilograms/month of hazardous waste are generated) must comply with the training requirements in 40 CFR 262.34(d).
Individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities must be familiar with the requirements cited in 40 CFR 265.16(b),
(c), and (d)(1) through (d)(4) and follow them when handling lead-based paint abatement waste.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Maintaining training records
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. RCRA requires that training records cited in 40 CFR 265.16(d)(1) through (d)(4) be maintained by hazardous waste
generators to show that a generator of hazardous waste who generates greater than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous
waste (see 40 CFR 261.3 and 261.10 through 35) has completed the RCRA training requirements. The abatement workers'
RCRA training records must be maintained on-site where abatement work will be performed.

VI. Certification of Individuals and Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of TSCA requires EPA to promulgate regulations to ensure, among other items, that contractors
engaged in
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead-based paint activities are certified. EPA interprets this requirement to apply to individuals, as well as firms,
engaged in lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``certified contractor,'' as defined in section 1004 of Title X, includes (1) a contractor, inspector or
supervisor who has completed a training program certified by EPA and who has met any other requirements for certification
established by EPA or who has been certified by any State through a program which has been found by EPA to be at least as
protective as the Federal certification program; and (2) workers and designers who have fully met training requirements
established by EPA or an approved State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA has determined that an individual performing lead-based paint activities as an inspector, supervisor,
worker or designer is subject to regulations as a ``certified contractor'' pursuant to section 402. Although ``risk
assessor'' was not expressly listed in the definition of ``certified contractor'' in section 1004 of Title X, the
function of a risk assessor _ to prepare a risk assessment _ is defined as a lead-based paint activity under TSCA Title
IV, section 402(b). Consequently the Agency is proposing to define a risk assessor as a ``contractor'' in the same
way that inspectors and supervisors are defined as contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time the Agency recognizes that the term ``contractor'' may also be used to describe a firm or a company,
rather than an individual. Consequently, the Agency is proposing regulations governing the activities of firms,
as well as individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(f) of the regulatory text identifies the requirements firms would need to meet to obtain
certification. Under these requirements a firm engaged in lead-based paint activities would submit to the approving
authority a letter certifying that the firm will only employ certified employees to conduct lead-based paint activities
and that the firm will adhere to the standards and recordkeeping requirements in proposed &sect;745.228.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that individuals are adequately trained and certified the Agency has developed two distinct training and
certification programs. One of the programs has been designed for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities
as workers and project planners/designers. The other program has been designed for individuals engaged in lead-based
paint activities as inspectors, supervisors and risk assessors. These certification programs are discussed in
detail in units VI.B. and C. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments received during the development of this proposed rule, the Agency is proposing the use of a national
certification exam to be included as a part of the certification process for inspector technicians, inspector/risk
assessors and supervisors. The national exam is included in the certification requirements described in &sect;745.226(b)
for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the administration of a certification exam would significantly contribute to the Agency's
efforts to ensure that individuals are adequately trained and would encourage a nationally consistent approach
to the development of a trained and certified workforce. Options for the development of a national exam and the purpose
of the exam are discussed in more detail later in units VI.D. and E. of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.226 of the regulatory text has also been developed as a model for States to use when establishing
their own certification programs in the context of applying for authorization under section 404 of Title IV of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed rule specifies certification requirements as well as standards for all individuals engaged
in lead-based paint activities, it does not contain a requirement that particular activities be undertaken in any
specific sequence. For example, there will be no requirement to conduct an inspection if, due to the availability
of historical information, lead-based paint is presumed to exist and a decision to abate without an inspection has
been made. Under such circumstances, the abatement may proceed using certified individuals without the conduct
of a prior inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only certified individuals may conduct the lead-based paint activities defined in this proposed regulation. If
a homeowner decides to have an inspection (as defined by this proposed regulation) conducted, the individual providing
the inspection service must be certified. However, any lead related work that does not meet the definition of a lead-based
paint activity, as identified in section 402(b)(1) and (2) and as defined by this regulation, need not be conducted
by a certified individual. For instance, during a kitchen remodelling project a homeowner may decide to have the paint
on only one wall in the kitchen tested for lead, by a non-certified individual or firm because such limited testing
is not an ``inspection'' as that term is defined by the regulation. However, no individual or firm may perform or even
offer to perform any lead-based activity, e.g. inspection, risk assessment, or abatement, as defined in this part,
unless certified according to the procedures found at proposed &sect;745.226. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Inspector Technician, Inspector/Risk Assessor, or Supervisor Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals wishing to become certified by the approving authority as an inspector technician, an inspector/risk
assessor, or a supervisor would have to: (1) Successfully complete the appropriate training course offered by an
accredited training program and secure a course completion certificate; (2) meet the appropriate experience and/or
education requirements and; (3) pass the certification examination recognized by the approving authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to take the certification examination, an individual would first have to present the required training
course completion certificate and documentation of the appropriate education/experience prerequisites to an
official of the examination administering body. Documents that would be recognized as proof of these prerequisites
are listed in proposed &sect;745.226(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experience and/or education requirements are proposed in the regulatory text for inspector/risk assessors for
target housing and public buildings, supervisors for target housing and public buildings, and supervisors for commercial
buildings and superstructures. There are no experience and/or education requirements proposed for inspector technicians
because the EPA believes that this would present an unnecessary barrier to entry into this field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many interested parties commented that the work experience and educational qualifications of inspector/risk assessors
and supervisors should be substitutable. Therefore, the Agency, in proposing education/experience requirements,
took into account its experience in developing training programs in the past (e.g., asbestos) and comments provided
by a number of interested parties, such as the Regional Lead Training Centers, labor organizations, advocacy organizations,
and trade organizations. Based on information received, the experience and education requirements for inspector/risk
assessors and supervisors were developed by the Agency in an effort to allow individuals to substitute qualifying
experience for education and visa versa. These requirements were developed to avoid excluding individuals whose
experience might warrant qualification to become certified but who would not qualify on the basis of the education
requirements alone. Proposed &sect;745.226(b)(1) of the regulatorytext describes the education/experience
requirements for inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency specifically requests comment on the education and/or experience requirements it is proposing for inspector/risk
assessors and supervisors, and its decision not to propose any education and/or experience requirements for inspector
technicians. It also is seeking comment on the administration of a national certification examination as discussed
in units VI.D. and E. of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Worker and Planner/Project Designer Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals wishing to become certified as workers in target housing and public buildings or commercial buildings
and superstructures or planner/project designers in target housing and public buildings would have to successfully
complete and receive a course completion certificate in the appropriate discipline from an accredited training
program. There are no experience and/or education prerequisites for workers or planner/project designers, nor
would these job disciplines be required to take a national certification examination. This decision is based on EPA's
understanding of the definition of ``certified contractor'' in section 1004 of Title X, which only requires training
as a precondition to certification for workers and planner/project designers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training course completion certificate issued to a worker or planner/project designer would serve as an interim
training certificate for 6 months. Within 6 months the individual would submit a valid copy of their course completion
certificate to the approving authority. The approving authority would then issue a final certification to each worker
and project designer. This certification would be valid for 3 years. An individual would have to be re-certified by
the approving authority before the certification expires. Training programs may wish to assist trainees in notifying
the approving authority of their eligibility for certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Certification Examination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(b) of the regulatory text describes the certification requirements for inspector technicians,
inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors. Under these requirements, an individual would successfully complete
the appropriate training course and secure the course completion certificate, and meet the appropriate education/experience
requirements. After obtaining a course completion certificate and meeting these requirements, an individual would
be ready to take the certification examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification examination is a key component of the Agency's certification program, especially for inspector
technicians, inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors. While there would be a required test at the end of each training
course, the certification examination would serve as a neutral or third party examination of the applicant's proficiency
in the appropriate training discipline. A neutral or third party would administer the examination in such a way that
the validity and security of the examination are maintained. The examination would serve to ensure that each individual
who will be certified under this program would have a common level of knowledge and understanding in their particular
discipline. It is the Agency's belief that administration of a neutral or third party examination would encourage
States to enter into reciprocal certification arrangements with other States nationwide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The examination itself would not be developed as part of this proposed regulation, but would be developed separately
under the auspices of EPA, according to guidelines discussed in paragraph E of this Unit in the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the approving authority may not always be able to offer the certification examination immediately
after an individual has received their course completion certificate. To allow individuals to begin work, the course
completion certificate would also serve as an interim certification until evidence of successfully passing the
next available certification examination is provided. This interim certification would be valid for up to 6 months.
If an individual did not pass the certification examination and receive their certificate within this 6&hyph;month
period, the individual would have to retake the appropriate course before reapplying for certification from the
approving authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After passing the certification examination and meeting the education/experience prerequisites, an individual
would be issued a certificate by the approving authority. This certification would be valid for 3 years. There would
be separate certification examinations offered for each discipline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is examining various options for the development and administration of the certification examination. One option
is for EPA or a State to work with a competent independent organization to develop and/or administer the certification
examinations based on the guidelines discussed below. A second option is to have authorized State programs develop
and administer their own certification examinations according to the Certification Examination Guidelines. A
third option is for EPA to develop and/or administer the certification examinations. Comment is invited on these
options and on the feasibility of an independent organization administering the examination. The goal of the certification
examination process is to give each State the flexibility it desires in fashioning its certification program, while
at the same time ensuring a consistent national level of competence in the lead-based paint activities workforce.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Certification Examination Criterion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are criterion that, although not a part of this proposed rule, EPA expects will be followed when developing
the certification examination:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Subject matter experts (SMEs) will be consulted throughout the development and early evaluation process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This consultation will be done using oral interviews and written questionnaires devised by the SMEs in concert
with testing development professionals. A job or task analysis will be performed for each discipline. This analysis
will be used in the development of the initial test questions and the overall development of the topical format of the
examinations, including the amount or percentage of questions for each topic covered on a particular examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A readability analysis of the test questions will be performed. Based on this evaluation, changes will be made as
necessary in the construction of the test questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Complete psychometric evaluation techniques will be utilized in the initial construction of the tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A cut score workshop will be conducted to review each question in the item bank (or test bank). The SME's shall be used
to evaluate each question. They would establish a level of difficulty for each question, as well as the percentage
of each topic to be covered on the test. Based on their knowledge of the industry, the SMEs will provide an estimate of
the number of candidates who would successfully complete each question. Once these items have been established,
an appropriate, industry accepted procedure will be used to set a minimum passing (or ``cut'') score for each examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Continuous psychometric evaluation of the test questions will be used. The test questions will be periodically
revised and updated through the collection of statistics regarding the performance of candidates on each question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that States may wish to impose additional testing requirements on candidates. This practice is acceptable
as long as the test questions used by a State do not duplicate the topics covered in the standardized certification
examination, but rather are specific to State laws, regulations, and work practice requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Certification Based on Prior Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is aware that when the regulation becomes effective, there will be many individuals who have, over the past several
years, already received training and have been working in the lead-based paint abatement field. While many of these
individuals may not believe that any additional training will be necessary, the Agency has a responsibility to ensure
that individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities are properly trained. The Agency does not, however, wish
to unnecessarily burden individuals, some of whom already have years of experience in this field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing this situation, the Agency has proposed at &sect;745.226(d) a procedure for certifying some of these
individuals under a reduced set of requirements. Anyone who has received lead-based paint activities training between
October 1, 1990, and the effective date of the rule may be eligible for certification under these proposed procedures.
To become eligible for certification based on prior training, all individuals would have to show proof of training
received after October 1, 1990, and that such training included a curricula similar to the requirements in &sect;745.225(c).
Inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors would also have to document that they meet the education and/or experience
requirements listed in proposed &sect;745.226(b)(1). These individuals would also have to successfully complete
a refresher training course and pass the national certification examination for the appropriate discipline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers and planner/project designers seeking certification under these procedures would have to successfully
complete a refresher training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering grandfathering, the Agency invites comment on what criteria should be used to compare prior training
with the training described in proposed &sect;745.225(c). The Agency believes that some evaluation of the adequacy
of previous training will be necessary to ensure that individuals are properly trained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has chosen the date of October 1, 1990, as the proposed cutoff for prior training because this is the date
the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) ``Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement
of Lead-Based Paint in Public and Indian Housing'' were issued. These guidelines were the most comprehensive and
accurate information on lead-based paint inspection and abatement issued up to that time. EPA believes that after
October 1, 1990, the HUD guidelines were widely distributed to training programs and that many individuals received
training based on these guidelines. The Agency requests specific comment on using the HUD Guidelines as a rationale
and the October 1, 1990 date as the cutoff point for allowing certification based on prior training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of July 1994, 3,245 copies of the guidelines and 231 copies of EPA's lead inspector training course, based substantially
on the HUD Guidelines, have been sold. Additionally, as of September 1993, 306 copies of EPA's model lead abatement
training course for supervisors and contractors, also substantially based on the HUD guidelines, had been sold.
All of these materials were sold to the general public through the HUD contractor-operated distribution center,
HUD User.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the establishment of EPA-supported Regional Lead Training Centers (RLTC) in March 1992, the Centers have trained
approximately 2,000 individuals in the Supervisor/Contractor Course (Ref. 8) and approximately 2,200 individuals
have received training in the RLTC's lead inspector training course (Ref. 9). The RLTCs use EPA's model courses as
the basis for their training classes. Again, EPA's model courses draw substantially from the HUD Guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rules, individuals would have up to 6 months after the effective date of proposed &sect;745.225
to apply for certification under these prior training procedures. After that date, all individuals wishing to obtain
certification would do so under the process outlined in proposed &sect;745.226(b) and (c) of the regulatory text.
The Agency recognizes that 6 months after &sect;745.225 becomes effective may not seem like an adequate amount of
time to apply for certification under the reduced set of requirements detailed in proposed &sect;745.226(d). However,
when it is considered that proposed &sect;745.225 does not become effective until 2 years and 6 months after the rule
(in its entirety) is issued or ``effective,'' the Agency believes that individuals will have plenty of time to prepare
to apply for certification under the procedures in &sect;745.226(d). The Agency requests comment on the procedures
it is proposing for a prior certification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Re-certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is aware that the lead-based paint activities field is evolving quickly in both inspection and abatement
technology. Given this, under the proposed rule, refresher training would be required every 3 years. This requirement
would be enforced by mandating that all certified individuals be recertified every 3 years. The Agency has chosen
3 years as the amount of time for re-certification for several reasons. EPA believes re-certification of individuals
every 1 or 2 years would be too burdensome. But, it also believes that waiting longer than 3 years would not allow individuals
to receive timely updates on innovations and technological advances in the lead inspection and abatement field or
on new regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To become re-certified, an individual would successfully complete an accredited 1&hyph;day refresher training
course specific to the discipline in which the individual seeks to be recertified through an accredited training
program; pass the refresher course test, and submit a refresher course completion certificate to the approving authority.

H. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Certification of Individuals Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 402(a) of TSCA, the approving authority would be able to, after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
suspend, revoke, or modify an individual's certification if an individual has committed any one of the acts listed
in &sect;745.226(g) of the proposed regulatory text. In addition, the approving authority would be able to suspend,
revoke, or modify the certification of individuals who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty
or a criminal conviction for engaging in a prohibited act under section 15 or section 409 of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, any individual who either: (1) Obtained certification through fraudulent representation or means,
or (2) obtained certification from a training program that is not accredited to offer training is not considered certified
for purposes of TSCA Title IV. It would be considered a violation of TSCA, as well as any other applicable provision
of law, for any such individual to conduct any lead-based paint activities requiring certification.

I. Certification of Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;745.226(f) of the regulatory text outlines procedures for the certification of firms. All firms
acting as contractors or conducting lead-based paint activities would have to be certified by the approving authority.
To become certified, a firm would submit a letter to the approving authority certifying that the firm will only employ
certified employees to conduct lead-based paint activities and that the firm will follow the standards and recordkeeping
requirements in proposed &sect;745.228.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes the certification of firms is necessary to ensure the use of a certified workforce and compliance
with recordkeeping requirements. A certified firm would present the approving authority with a more manageable
point of contact for administration and enforcement, as opposed to the Agency attempting to monitor the activities
of every worker involved in lead-based paint activities. Additionally, the provisions for the identification of
qualified firms would provide a source of information for the public to identify firms qualified to conduct lead-based
paint activities in target housing, public and commercial buildings, and superstructures. Additionally, the required
certification mechanism would also provide the Agency with a mechanism for notifying contractors of new technologies
and regulatory requirements in an effective and timely manner. A certified firm would follow the recordkeeping standards
outlined in &sect;745.228 of the proposed regulatory text.

J. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Certification of Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approving authority would be able to, after notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify a firm's
certificate if a firm has committed any of the acts listed in &sect;745.226(h) of the proposed regulatory text. In
addition, the approving authority may suspend, revoke, or modify the certification of firms that have been subject
to a final order imposing a civil penalty or a criminal conviction for engaging in a prohibited act under section 15
or section 409 of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore any firm which either: (1) Obtained certification through fraudulent representation or means, or (2)
fails to obtain a certificate from the approving Authority is not certified for purposes of TSCA Title IV. It shall
be considered a violation of TSCA as well as any other applicable provision of law, for any such firm to conduct any lead-based
paint activities requiring certification.

Proposed &sect;745.226(h) outlines the procedures to be followed if the approving authority decides to suspend,
revoke or modify the certification of any individual or firm. These include procedures for the notification of the
individual or firm; the conduct of the hearing, if requested; and the procedures for immediate action to suspend the
certification of any individual or firm.

VII. Standards for Conducting Lead-Based Paint Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 402(b) of TSCA requires EPA to develop training and certification requirements for individuals and contractors
engaged in lead-based paint activities. The statute also states that such regulations shall contain standards for
performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account reliability, effectiveness, and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed rule, EPA has divided the standards for lead-based paint activities into three separate categories
with lead identification and control disciplines specified for each category. These categories include target
housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and superstructures. In target housing, the standards cover
inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public buildings, covers the identification
of lead-based paint and lead-containing materials, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition. The final set of
standards are for identification, deleading, and demolition in commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed rule specifies certification requirements as well as standards for all individuals engaged
in lead-based paint activities, it does not contain a requirement that particular activities be undertaken in any
specific sequence. There will be no requirement to conduct an inspection if, due to the availability of historical
information, lead-based paint is presumed to exist and a decision to abate without an inspection has been made. Under
such circumstances, the abatement may proceed using certified individuals without the conduct of a prior inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background Documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory timeframe for developing final standards for conducting lead-based paint activities under section
402(a) did not allow sufficient time to conduct extensive new studies and develop entirely new standards for the broad
range of lead-based paint activities as defined in this proposed rule. However, the Agency was able to draw on a body
of existing information and research in the development of these standards. In addition, during the development
of this proposal, the Agency received written input from a broad range of individuals and groups who are currently
working in the fields that conduct lead-based paint activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One example of such resource material is the Interim HUD Lead-Based Paint Guidelines. The Guidelines, published
in 1990, is a comprehensive document that covers all aspects of lead-based paint inspection and abatement activities.
The Guidelines provided an invaluable starting point for the development of EPA's inspection, risk assessment,
and abatement standards. The Guidelines are the only nationally recognized blueprint for conducting safe and effective
abatement in target housing. While State and regional requirements exist for methodologies for some lead-based
paint activities, no other set of guidelines has been used as extensively as the HUD Guidelines. Section 1017 of Title
X requires that HUD issue new guidelines for risk assessment, inspection, interim controls, and abatement. These
guidelines will be entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Evaluation and Reduction of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Leading experts in the field of lead-based paint inspection, risk assessment, and abatement have been consulted
by HUD in developing these new guidelines, including lead-based paint abatement trainers and abatement professionals,
as well as government officials from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), EPA and HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the development of the revised guidelines paralleled the development of this proposed rule, the Agency was
able to consult with HUD throughout the rule development process in an attempt to achieve consistency between the
two documents. The Agency will, when it is available, include a copy of the new HUD guidelines in the public docket for
this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Inspection for Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of an inspection is to determine, and then report, the existence of lead-based paint in residential
dwellings through a surface-by-surface investigation. The data collection and reporting standards specified
in &sect;745.228(a) must be followed when conducting an inspection. Because the data collection and reporting standards
are crucial to the accuracy of an inspection, an inspection may only be conducted by an individual certified as either
an inspector technician or an inspector/risk assessor. An inspection is, by definition, intended to provide a comprehensive
inventory of all lead-based paint in a dwelling unit. Consistent with this definition, the inspection report will
provide a detailed evaluation of the presence of lead in all paint within the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to define a unit as a room, or connected group of rooms, used or intended to be used by a single tenant
or owner. Section 745.228(a)(2)(ii) of the proposed regulatory text states that component surfaces with distinct
painting histories in every unit must be tested. This effectively means that every unique component within a room
that has a painted surface that has been deemed to have such a painting history by the inspector technician or inspector/risk
assessor, would have to be tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that every unique painted surface be tested is consistent with the Title X definition of an inspection
involving a ``surface-by-surface investigation.'' An inspection is intended to provide detailed information
on the presence of lead in all paint in a dwelling unit, and the procedures in this proposed standard are intended to
provide a framework to obtain this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspection standards reflect the Agency's preliminary decision not to provide detailed instruction on how to
perform specific lead-based paint identification tasks, for instance, taking a paint chip sample or operating an
XRF instrument, but instead to assure that analysis information is obtained and maintained as part of the recordkeeping
requirements. Because the actual methods and techniques used to determine the presence of lead-based paint (the
test methods) are constantly evolving, and improvements in technology are expected to continue, the standards contained
in this proposed rule do not specify the technology to be utilized for analysis, but do require documented methodologies
which incorporate adequate quality control procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of analytical technologies capable of lead-based paint testing include field portable XRF and, laboratory
analysis of paint chip samples by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP). EPA does not intend, in this regulation, to specify in detail the procedures for the analysis
of paint for lead content. The new HUD guidelines, provide comprehensive guidance on both XRF sampling, and laboratory
analytical methods, and the procedures in the guidelines should be followed when conducting lead-based paint testing.
The Agency is considering the need for promulgating detailed regulatory requirements for lead-based paint testing
and requests comment on the need for such an enforceable testing regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards do require that any environmental laboratory analysis to determine the lead content in paint,
dust, and soil, be done by only those laboratories recognized by the Agency as being capable of performing these activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy is widely used as a field inspection devise. The accumulated experience in
use of XRF instruments has provided anecdotal evidence that they are subject to unexplained variances in performance.
To date, there has been little comprehensive evaluation of the performance of XRFs under actual field conditions.
Because of the questions raised concerning XRFs performance, EPA is conducting a field study of lead-based paint
measurement technology. Results of this study will be used to shape lead-based paint testing guidelines which will
be reflected in the new HUD guidelines and disseminated as guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While methodologies for determining the presence of lead-based paint may vary, the inspection standards would require
that the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor prepare an inspection report that would detail the findings
of their inspection and the methods used during the inspection. The inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor
would have to adhere to the reporting requirements listed in proposed &sect;745.228(a)(6) of the regulatory text.
Accurate completion of the report would be the enforceable component of the inspection standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspection report would serve as a guide for the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor to ensure that
all of the necessary information will be obtained during an inspection. An example of an inspection report can be found
in the HUD guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An inspection report would have to be completed for each unit inspected. Upon completion of the testing, an inspection
report would be written and would include all information required in &sect;745.228(a)(6) of the proposed regulatory
text. The inspection report would be retained by the owner of the residence or building and the certified firm that
conducted the inspection for a period of 3 years. Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act of 1992 requires that by October 1994, the Agency and HUD develop a regulation for the disclosure of lead-based
paint hazards in target housing which will be offered for sale or lease. The inspection report would be subject to the
disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the section 1018 regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Risk Assessment for Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal government's commonly held definition of risk assessment defines the health effects of exposure to hazardous
materials to individuals or populations by conducting a hazard identification, a dose-response assessment, an
exposure assessment, and a risk characterization (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process, National Academy Press
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Ref. 1). This form of risk assessment focuses on a quantitative analysis of risk to human health and does not recommend
options for the management of the risk. Risk assessment as defined by TSCA Title IV, differs from this traditional
concept in that the inspector/risk assessor is relied upon to not only identify lead-based paint hazards, but to also
recommend options for the management of these hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 401(16) of TSCA provides that the objective of a risk assessment is to determine, and then report the existence,
nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings through an on-site investigation.
This definition is based on the risk assessment protocols developed by HUD and the Housing Authority Risk Retention
Group (HUD/HARRG) as mandated by amendments to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the Lead-Based
Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;242). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, a risk assessment, including the risk assessment report, may only be conducted by an individual
certified as an inspector/risk assessor. However, an inspector technician may, assist a certified inspector/risk
assessor by taking paint, soil, and dust samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency views the role of the inspector/risk assessor as pivotal in reducing risks associated with lead-based
paint. The certified inspector/risk assessor will be a trained specialist equipped with the requisite professional
credentials needed to evaluate risks associated with lead-based paint. The Agency envisions that a certified inspector/risk
assessor would be qualified to make a competent, and rational assessment of the location and severity of lead-based
paint hazards. The procedures outlined in proposed &sect;745.228(b) of the regulatory text provide a framework
for the collection of risk assessment data. These procedures were developed on the premise that the background and
required training of a professional inspector/risk assessor would enable the inspector/risk assessor to identify
risks associated with lead-based paint hazards and to develop options for actions to eliminate hazards. The required
training would, through the accreditation process outlined in this regulation, include the best scientific information
available on characterizing hazardous levels of lead in paint, soil, and dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier in this preamble, the Agency is currently developing criteria pursuant to section 403 of TSCA for
the identification of lead hazards in soil, dust, and paint to facilitate the risk assessment decision making process.
When promulgated, the determinations made under the section 403 regulation, and associated guidance, will be widely
disseminated by the Agency, and will be a required element of the training course curricula under this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards in this regulation are intended to apply to individual residential dwelling units, whether in multi-unit
residential dwelling or in single-family housing. The procedures for determining which units are to be assessed
within a multiunit dwelling are not included in these standards. This decision should be made by the building owner
or housing authority in consultation with the inspector/risk assessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first step of a risk assessment is to have the risk assessor survey the unit or dwelling to evaluate its overall condition.
In buildings built after 1960 in relatively good condition where the probability of finding lead-based paint hazards
is low, a comprehensive risk assessment may be unnecessary. To avoid the cost of conducting a comprehensive risk assessment,
an owner of these dwellings may wish to have the risk assessor conduct a lead hazard screen before initiating the complete
risk assessment. According to the HUD guidelines, such a screen employs more limited sampling and more sensitive
hazard identification criteria. In general a screen involves determining overall paint condition in a unit, taking
limited dust samples from floors and exterior window sills, and soil samples from bare soil. A detailed discussion
of how to conduct a screen and the criteria used to evaluate the results of a screen can be found in the HUD guidelines.
If a unit fails this screen, EPA recommends that a risk assessment, as described in proposed &sect;745.228(b)(2)
through (b)(9) of the regulatory text, be conducted. Failure of the screen indicates that lead hazards may be present
and that a more thorough risk assessment is warranted to definitively identify the lead hazards within the unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this point the risk assessor would review any background information as described in proposed &sect;745.228(b)(2).
This data will contain useful information regarding the physical characteristics of the unit and residential use
patterns within the unit. This information includes the age of the building or if there are children under age 6 living
in the unit, as well as information on any known lead-related health problems of any occupant of the dwelling unit.
Further, the risk assessor would obtain any other available information that would characterize occupant use patterns
that may generate or contribute to lead-based paint hazards. Examples of this information could include family hobbies
that involve lead, the location of a commonly used entryway or commonly opened windows. The inspector/risk assessor
should also obtain, if available, any previous test results or inspections regarding lead-based paint or other assessments
for lead-related hazards. This information may prove valuable in determining the presence of lead-based paint without
having to re-sample areas of the unit. However, the inspector/risk assessor must evaluate the quality and the reliability
of any previous test results. Past inspections may not conform to current standards of care, possibly resulting in
an incorrect determination of the location of lead-based paint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in a risk assessment is to conduct a closer visual inspection of the condition of the painted surfaces
within the unit. Any paint found to be deteriorated should be tested by an inspector technician or the inspector/risk
assessor according to the procedures found in the inspection portion of the proposed standards. The inspector/risk
assessor should also test any surfaces that they determine may be a source of lead dust or lead-based chips. These include
friction and impact surfaces such as door and window frames, or painted surfaces accessible to children such as window
sills or stair treads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dust samples should be collected within each selected unit according in parts of the living area where children are
most likely to come into contact with dust. These areas include bedrooms, family rooms, and kitchens. In general,
any area that children frequent in the dwelling should be evaluated for lead-contaminated dust. The HUD guidelines
as well as the currently available EPA model inspector course provide detailed guidance and instruction in the collection
of dust samples in residential dwellings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, randomly selected soil samples should be collected by an inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor
and analyzed in order to adequately characterize the lead concentrations in exterior play areas, areas containing
bare soil, and along the dripline or foundation area of a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All dust, soil, and where appropriate, paint samples should be sent to a laboratory that is fully recognized by EPA
as being capable of performing these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with an inspection, the data collected as part of a risk assessment would be documented in an assessment report.
Proposed &sect;745.228(b)(8) of the regulatory text describes all items required to be included in the risk assessment
report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 401(16) of TSCA, a risk assessment may include ``other activity as may be appropriate.'' Based
on this language, the Agency is proposing that the risk assessment report should, as a final step, identify lead hazard
control strategies to address all identified lead-based paint hazards. A justification for each hazard control
strategy identified must also be provided. The inspector/risk assessor should also prioritize each of the hazard
control actions based on the immediacy of the hazard, and recommend a schedule to the building owner for addressing
hazards. Clearly the most hazardous conditions (e.g. badly deteriorated lead-based paint) within a unit should
be addressed as soon as possible, and before other control actions are taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk assessment report is to be maintained by the owner of the residence or building, as well as the certified individual
or firm that conducted the assessment for at least three years. This information would also be subject to the disclosure
and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation developed under section 1018 of Title X. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Abatement for Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Abatement is defined by section 401(1) of TSCA as ``any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based
paint hazards.'' The term, as defined, includes the removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust, the
permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead-painted surfaces or fixtures,
and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil. In addition, it includes all preparation, cleanup, disposal,
and post-abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. By definition, abatement is limited
to those activities that are designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Abatement does not include renovation and remodeling, or landscaping activities, whose primary intent is not to
permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards, but is instead to repair, restore, or remodel a given structure
or dwelling, even though these activities may incidently result in a reduction in lead-based paint hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this regulation, the Agency will presume abatement to occur in the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Projects for which there is a written contract stating that an individual or firm will be conducting activities
on or in a dwelling unit that will permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Projects involving the permanent elimination of lead-based paint or lead-contaminated soil conducted by firms
or individuals certified in accordance with this regulation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Projects involving the permanent elimination of a lead-based paint hazard or lead-contaminated soil conducted
by firms or individuals who, through their company name, promotional literature, or otherwise, advertise or hold
themselves out to be lead abatement professionals. The definition of abatement includes the phrase ``permanent
containment or encapsulation.'' Encapsulation is defined as a process that makes lead-based paint inaccessible,
by providing a barrier between the lead-based paint and the environment. This barrier is formed using a liquid applied
coating or an adhesively bonded material. The primary means of attachment for an encapsulant is bonding of the product
to the surface either by itself or through the use of an adhesive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes the fact that all encapsulant's will degrade over time, so therefore, no encapsulant is truly
permanent. Nevertheless, the Agency would consider an encapsulant to be ``permanent'' within the meaning of TSCA
Title IV if the encapsulant is periodically monitored and maintained over the lifetime of the surface. The Agency
is soliciting comment on the proposed requirement for the periodic monitoring of encapsulants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permanent containment of lead-based paint would be achieved through the use of a mechanical enclosure system.
The enclosure should be a rigid, durable barrier that is mechanically attached to the building component, with all
edges and seams sealed with caulk or other sealant to provide a dust-tight system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined in this proposal, an abatement would have to be conducted by persons certified by the appropriate approving
authority as a worker or supervisor. Every abatement project would require a supervisor assigned to it who has been
certified by the appropriate approving authority. The supervisor, if not on-site, would have to be available by phone
and able to physically be present at the work-site within 2 hours. This supervisor, as well as the certified firm they
work for, would be responsible for ensuring that all abatement activities in target housing are completed according
to the standards outlined in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding project designer/planners, the Agency is including in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(7) of the regulatory
text, a requirement that they prepare a written pre-abatement plan for projects involving the abatement of 10 or more
units, since the size of these operations may require a level of expertise not required in single-family, or smaller
multi-unit projects. The Agency is requesting comment on the proposed requirement that a project designer/planner
must be utilized to design abatement projects for units numbering 10 or more. The Agency has also considered this size
distinction in development of its Interim Final Regulations to amend the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act's
(AHERA) Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan to include public buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pre-abatement plan is to be completed by the supervisor or project designer/planner as appropriate for the size
of the work project. This plan would follow the standards for worker, environmental and occupant protection as outlined
in this proposed rule. Because there may be a potential conflict of interest between those who conduct the inspection/risk
assessment and those who actually do the abatement, it is recommended that the plan contain a statement that the persons
or firm engaged in the inspection and/or risk assessment of a unit should not perform lead abatement activities in
that same unit. This type of conflict may arise if inspector/risk assessors are in a position to receive a financial
benefit by recommending that an abatement be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To protect the health of building occupants, the rule as proposed would require that an occupancy protection plan
be developed by the supervisor or planner/project designer. This plan should address what measures would be taken
during the abatement to protect the building occupants, and what method of verification would be utilized to document
this protection. In development of the plan, certain factors should be taken into consideration, for example, the
length of abatement, remaining access to facilities and exits, and total area involved. In plans which require the
relocation of occupants, samples would be collected, analyzed, and clearance levels met according to proposed &sect;745.228(c)(9)
before re-occupancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An abatement project typically involves one or more of the following techniques: Building component replacement,
the use of physical enclosure systems, or on-site or off-site paint removal from building components. It is the responsibility
of the abatement supervisor, with possible input from the risk assessor, to determine the most appropriate course
of action to eliminate identified lead hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 745.228(c)(6) of the proposed rule would require that the supervisor of an abatement job submit a pre-abatement
notification to EPA or the approving authority, for their information, prior to the commencement of the abatement.
In the case of an authorized State program, States may develop their own notification procedures as part of the State
program. This requirement has been included to assist with targeting enforcement efforts. The Agency wants to protect
against lead abatement related risks to workers, the environment, and any individuals who may remain in a unit during
abatement. The Agency believes that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) May 4, 1994 Interim
Final Rule, Lead Exposure in Construction, will adequately protect all workers engaged in lead-based paint abatement.
The Agency is currently working closely with OSHA to ensure that workers employed by State and local governments,
and therefore not covered by the OSHA regulation, will be covered under this proposed regulation in States without
OSHA-approved State plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its interim rule, OSHA reduced the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from 200 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The OSHA interim rule also includes a list of three categories of tasks that are commonly known to produce exposures
above the PEL. The performance of the tasks within these categories automatically triggers basic protective provisions
that mandate the use of particular types of respiratory protection unless air monitoring is conducted to determine
that protection is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not currently part of this proposed regulation, the Agency is considering prohibiting certain work practices,
due to the potential risk of lead contamination posed by these practices to workers and/or the environment. The following
work practices are being considered for prohibition during the abatement of lead-based paint in target housing:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Open flame burning of painted surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Dry scraping or sanding of painted surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The use of heat guns on painted surfaces for abatement without proper protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These practices have been singled out because of the potential risk of exposure to lead-contaminated dust and toxic
fumes. The Agency is seeking comments and/or data related to exposure to lead-contaminated dust and fumes from these
or other abatement work practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the completion of an abatement, post-abatement soil and dust clearance testing would have to be conducted
by a certified inspector technician or an inspector/risk assessor according to the procedures in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(9)
for dust sampling, and proposed &sect;745.086(c)(10) for soil sampling. Exterior dust and soil clearance levels
would also have to be evaluated after the lead-based paint abatement of exterior walls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspector/risk assessor would evaluate the results of the clearance testing to determine if the clearance levels
have been met. It is also recommended that there be no economic relationship between the inspector technician or inspector/risk
assessor and persons engaged in abatement due to conflict-of-interest concerns. The Agency is interested in comments
on the burden of requiring that the clearance determination being made by the inspector/risk assessor, as opposed
to the abatement supervisor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspector/risk assessor should compare the residual lead dust level (as determined by the laboratory analysis)
from each dust sample with the clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, window sills, window wells, and exterior
surfaces, as established in the HUD Guidelines for the Evaluation and Controls of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing.
The Agency may in the future establish clearance levels pursuant to section 403 of TSCA, and if so, then these levels
will be applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a unit fails clearance testing, the unit will be recleaned followed by repeating clearance procedures. In addition,
the hazard control strategy may need to be reexamined and appropriately adjusted or improved if clearance levels
continually fail to meet prescribed levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for soil contamination, following exterior lead-based paint abatement activities, is also a concern
of the Agency. The proposed approach to dealing with this problem is the comparison of pre- and post-abatement soil
lead levels to determine what soil lead level should be achieved for clearance following an abatement. The testing
protocol for soil in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(10) includes the sampling of soil from the dripline and foundation
areas as well as any children's play areas. To determine if post-abatement soil lead levels (using the above-mentioned
sampling methods) have increased at a statically significant level, the Agency is proposing that a statistical analysis,
such as a paired student T-test be used. If the soil lead levels increase at the 95 percent confidence limit, then the
soil must be remediated back to the pre-abatement lead level, or the soil must be abated following the standards in
proposed &sect;745.228(j). If there is no significant increase at the 95 percent confidence limit, then no remediation
or abatement is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reports and recordkeeping play an essential role in tracking and monitoring the effectiveness and safety of lead-based
paint hazard abatement in target housing. The certified supervisor is responsible for completing the abatement
report as described in proposed &sect;745.228(c)(12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records would be maintained by the building owner and the persons conducting the abatement activity for at least 3
years. These records will be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements promulgated under section
1018 of Title X. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed soil abatement procedures in &sect;745.228(j) of the regulatory text would require the removal of soil
to a depth determined by the inspector/risk assessor and replacement of contaminated soil with non-contaminated
soil. If contaminated soil is to be replaced with non-contaminated soil, the inspector/risk assessor will determine
the source of soil that is to be used as a replacement. Since most soil has naturally occurring background levels of
lead, replacement soil should contain levels that are not hazardous to human health or the environment. The Agency
feels that the inspector/risk assessor has the experience necessary to chose an appropriate source of replacement
soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to removal and possible replacement, the contaminated soil shall be permanently covered. Examples
of a permanent covering include pavement or concrete. Grass or other landscaping material are not considered permanent
covering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A written abatement report would also be prepared by the supervisor or planner/project designer, (depending on the
size of the project) that provides a written description of the abatement and presents the results of the clearance
testing. The abatement report would also be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation
developed under section 1018 of Title X.

F. Management of Waste From Target Housing Lead Abatement Activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) establishes a comprehensive Federal program to regulate the handling
of solid wastes under 42 U.S.C. sections 6901&hyph;6992k. RCRA Subtitle C creates a cradle-to-grave regulatory
structure for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste (42 U.S.C. sections 6921&hyph;6939b). RCRA
Subtitle D governs the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste (42 U.S.C. sections 6941&hyph;6969a). The RCRA regulatory
structure requires generators to determine whether their solid wastes are hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA
Subtitle C. EPA has promulgated a rule under RCRA which sets forth criteria for determining whether certain solid
wastes or debris are hazardous wastes. One of the characteristics of hazardous wastes is toxicity. To determine if
a solid waste is a toxicity characteristic hazardous waste, it should be tested for its toxicity characteristic pursuant
to 40 CFR 261.24. The Toxicity Characteristic (TC) regulatory limit for lead is 5 parts per million in the leachate
from the test protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When abating lead paint, different types of solid waste are generated which may be subject to RCRA hazardous waste
regulations. EPA is concerned that the application of RCRA hazardous waste regulations to these wastes may unnecessarily
hamper lead abatement. The Agency wishes to minimize potential regulatory impediments thus facilitating lead paint
abatement in residences where children and other individuals may be at risk. EPA is currently evaluating options
for modifying RCRA regulations so that lead abatement proceeds expeditiously while ensuring safe and effective
management and disposal of abatement wastes. Under a separate rulemaking, EPA plans to issue a proposal addressing
lead abatement wastes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Identification of Lead-Based Paint in Public Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 745.228 (a)(1) through (a)(7)(i) of the regulatory text proposes standards that would be used for the identification
of lead-based paint in public buildings. Because children make up a significant number of the occupants in target
housing and public buildings, which include day-care centers, schools, museums, and churches, these standards
are the same as those proposed for target housing. A second reason for utilizing the same standards is the similarity
of building and structural components in target housing and public buildings. Although many public buildings contain
structural steel components, such as steel frames, these are covered for fire protection and cosmetic reasons with
materials that are similar to those used in target housing. Given the similarity of materials presenting exposure
risks to occupants, EPA believes that persons seeking to identify lead-based paint in public buildings can use the
same inspection methods (such as XRF analysis) as those used in target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;745.228 (d)(2), all information collected from the identification of lead-based paint would
have to be maintained by the owner of the public building tested for a period of not less than 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Risk Assessment for Public Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the structural similarities between public buildings and target housing, a high probability exists
in certain public buildings (e.g., day care centers and schools), as in target housing, that children will be present
and potentially exposed to lead-based paint hazards. Although, TSCA Title IV does not expressly require EPA to establish
a risk assessment standard for public buildings, the Agency has decided for public health reasons to propose such
a standard in this regulation. The Agency believes that regulating the conduct of a risk assessment in public buildings
is implied in the definition of ``deleading'' in section 402(b), which includes planning of lead elimination activities.
The Agency believes that without a proper risk assessment, there is no assurance that effective abatements can be
conducted in public buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of a risk assessment is to determine the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint
hazards and identify appropriate hazard reduction steps. Given the structural similarities between target housing
and public buildings, this proposed regulation provides similar protocols to those required for conducting risk
assessments in target housing. The Agency is specifically requesting comment on this proposed approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;745.228(e)(2), records would have to be maintained by the building owner and persons conducting
the abatement and all information collected must be maintained by the owner of the building tested for a period of not
less than 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Abatement in Public Buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards in &sect;745.228(c)(1) through (c)(9)(iv)(D) and (c)(11) through (c)(16) of the regulatory
text would also be applicable to abatement in public buildings as defined by this proposed rule. Section 402(b) of
TSCA identifies abatement-like activities associated with public buildings using the term ``deleading.'' Because
both terms are defined in Title IV in terms of the ``elimination'' of lead-based paint hazards, for purposes of this
proposed regulation, the Agency is treating the two terms, ``abatement'' and ``deleading,'' as if they were synonymous.
The Agency believes that abatement activities in public buildings and methods of measuring protection for their
workers, occupants, and the environment should be similar to those for target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;745.228(f)(2), records would have to be maintained by the building owner and persons conducting
the abatement and all information collected must be maintained by the owner of the building tested for a period of not
less than 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of waste from lead-based paint abatement activities in public buildings, including schools and day-care
centers, is another area of concern to EPA. Wastes generated from lead-based paint activities (e.g., abatement and
deleading) are currently, depending upon the results of the TC analysis, covered by RCRA hazardous waste regulations.
As discussed in unit VIII.F. of this preamble, EPA is evaluating options for modifying existing RCRA regulations
to eliminate potential impediments to lead abatement, while ensuring safe and effective management and disposal
of such wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

J. Demolition in Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;745.228(g)(1), the certified supervisor would be required to collect any historical information on
the uses of lead-based paint in a building or superstructure that would be demolished. The proposed standards for
demolition are applicable only when the deleading of components prior to destruction of the facility occurs. If deleading
is conducted as a part of the demolition activity, the standards under &sect;745.228(i)(1) through (7) are applicable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the conduct of lead-based paint activities would require a hazardous waste determination pursuant
to 40 CFR 262.11 prior to demolition. All demolition waste would be treated in accordance with RCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Identification of Lead-Based Paint in Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards in &sect;745.228(h)(1) through (h)(4) of the regulatory text describe the standards for
the identification of lead-based paint on steel superstructures and commercial buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information received from professional organizations that are involved in steel structure deleading activities,
EPA believes: (1) That maintenance and painting records are available more often in a commercial setting than in target
housing or public buildings; (2) that processes for lead identification in commercial buildings would be more similar
to those used in superstructures than to those used in target housing because unenclosed metal components are a primary
architectural feature of commercial buildings such as warehouses; and (3) the purpose of identifying lead is inherently
different in commercial and superstructure settings from that in target housing settings. Unlike target housing,
the purpose of identifying lead hazards in commercial and superstructure settings is not to remove the lead-based
paint because it may pose a hazard to occupants. Instead, the purpose is to identify a potential hazard to workers doing
building or structural maintenance, and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paint (lead paint included) removed from components in commercial buildings and superstructures, is generally
removed as part of routine maintenance on those components. The supervisor should determine if lead-based paint
exists prior to starting work to minimize exposures to workers. Given the toxicity of lead, sampling to determine
the presence of lead-based paint is commonly practiced prior to maintenance work on superstructures and in commercial
settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These identification practices include obtaining relevant, available historical information on the use of lead-based
paint for a structure or building. Previous project specifications or inspection reports may provide the necessary
information. If the use of lead-based paint cannot be conclusively ruled-out, limited sampling would be conducted
by a certified supervisor according to proposed &sect;745.228(h)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ban on the use of lead-based paint on bridges in 1980, many States
have required the use of lead substitutes for primary coatings on bridges. Given this requirement, the frequency
with which bridges are repainted raises some fundamental questions about recordkeeping requirements. The Agency
is proposing that all information collected from the identification of lead-based paint on steel structures such
as bridges, would be maintained by the owner of the structure tested until such a time that the structure, or portion
of the structure is to be repainted. This proposed requirement is based on the variable frequency with which steel
structures are generally repainted and maintained. The Agency is requesting comment on this requirement to maintain
records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Deleading of Lead-Based Paint in Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards for deleading of commercial buildings and superstructures are found in &sect;745.228(i)(1)
through (i)(8) of the regulatory text. Given the similarities between superstructures and commercial buildings
described earlier, the Agency believes that deleading activities and methods of ensuring the protection of workers,
occupants and/or individuals within the vicinity, and the environment should also be similar to those used for superstructures.
A deleading plan would have to be completed by a certified supervisor prior to initiating deleading activities. This
plan would address worker protection, as well as environmental protection issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is concerned about the risk to workers and the environment due to deleading activities in commercial buildings
and steel structures. As with all other abatement and deleading activities, the Agency is relying on the May 4, 1994
Interim Final OSHA rule, Lead Exposure in Construction. For a more complete discussion of these standards see the
OSHA requirements at 29 CFR part 1926. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also considering prohibiting open flame burning of painted surfaces; the dry scraping or sanding of
painted surfaces; and the use of heat guns on painted surfaces for deleading on superstructures and commercial buildings
because of the potential risk of lead contamination to workers and/or the environment posed by these practices. The
Agency is interested in comments on whether it should prohibit these practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste generated when abating commercial buildings and superstructures may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C hazardous
waste regulations and should be handled accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recordkeeping requirements for deleading in commercial buildings or on superstructures with lead-based paint
are proposed in &sect;745.228(i)(6). The report described in &sect;745.228(i)(6) shall be maintained by the owner
or oversight agency until such a time that the structure, or portion of the structure is to be repainted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The removal of lead-based paint in commercial buildings and superstructures, could potentially affect water quality
through two routes. The first route is by non-point source contamination, e.g., lead-contaminated dust that is deposited
as a result of deleading activities is transported overland to waterbodies through stormwater runoff. The second
route is by point source discharge, e.g., a direct deposition of lead-based paint or dust to a waterbody, or from channelized
stormwater runoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-point source contamination may be controlled through compliance with RCRA (40 CFR 3004(d) and 268.35(a)), which
includes settled dust and debris from deleading activities. RCRA 40 CFR 268.35(a) prohibits the land disposal of
waste which exceed the toxic characteristic regulatory limit for lead. In addition, guidance issued by EPA pursuant
to the Coastal Zone Act Re-authorization Amendments (CZARA) section 6217(g) identifies a management measure for
the operation and maintenance of roads, highways, and bridges in coastal States to incorporate requirements for
pollution prevention procedures to reduce pollutant loadings to surface waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal of lead-containing materials from steel bridges has resulted in inadvertent discharges of lead compounds
that exceeded State water quality criteria, and showed the potential for long-term environmental impacts based
on sediment sampling (``Long Term Environmental Evaluation of Paint Residue and Blast Cleaning Abrasives from the
Middle River Bridge Repainting Project,'' California State Department of Transportation, 1982). Existing federal
regulations on steel structural projects are being applied on a site-specific basis. However, differences between
States' water quality standards and subsequent implementation of those standards indicates a need for a consistent
water quality policy with respect to discharges of lead into waterways during removal of lead-containing materials
from steel structures. This is of particular importance due to the number of contractors who work in multiple State
jurisdictions, as well as the occurrence of bridge structures which span interstate waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Clean Water Act's (CWA) National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program and interpretive
case law, paint removal devices used on bridges/superstructures, such as wet and dry abrasive blasters, high pressure
waterjet blasters, and sponge-jet blasters, may constitute point sources. Therefore, the CWA mandates that NPDES
permit applications must be submitted to either EPA or States approved to administer the NPDES program prior to any
discharge [40 CFR 122.21(c)]. Of course, if there is no discharge or potential discharge to waters of the U.S., no NPDES
permit is required. Individual sources are required to obtain permits, but EPA believes that general permits may
be an appropriate mechanism to cover bridge stripping and painting discharges. According to 40 CFR 122.28 (a)(2)(ii),
the sources covered in a general permit must involve the same types of operations, discharge the same types of wastes,
require the same operating conditions, require similar monitoring, and be more appropriately controlled under
a general permit than under individual permits. General permits reduce the administrative burden on both the permitting
agency and the permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the best technologies available to avoid or eliminate releases of lead to the air, land, or
water, and studies showing the amounts of releases that occur with those technologies. EPA can then suggest operating
conditions or discharge limits which may be appropriate for general permits.

M. Applicability of RCRA to Lead-Based Paint Wastes from Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waste generated by the lead-based paint abatement contractors when removing lead paint from public and commercial
buildings and superstructures may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations. The Toxicity Characteristic
(TC) regulatory limit for lead is 5 parts per million in a leachate derived by utilizing the Toxic Characteristic Leaching
Protocol (TCLP). The lead-based paint waste generator must determine if the waste generated is hazardous by either
testing a representative sample of the waste in accordance with 40 CFR part 261 subpart C, or an equivalent method approved
pursuant to 40 CFR 260.21, or by applying knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials
or process used. If the representative test sample exceeds the TC regulatory limit, the waste must be managed as a RCRA
hazardous waste, and the contractor would be a hazardous waste generator and must, therefore, comply with 40 CFR part
262 requirements. In addition, the training requirements for generators of lead-based paint waste as discussed
in this preamble are applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has different requirements for generators of different quantities of hazardous waste. For example, the regulations
conditionally exempt small quantity generators of 100 kg or less hazardous waste per calendar month, but it is very
unlikely that waste generated during the deleading or abatement work on larger buildings and superstructures would
generate less than 100 kg. Therefore, many of these contractors would be classified as ordinary generators and therefore
would be subject to 40 CFR parts 262 through 266, 268, and 270 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the lead-based paint waste is determined to be a hazardous waste and is captured, it could be managed on-site, most
likely through storage or treatment. This can be technically more challenging and may require a hazardous waste treatment
permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 270. One notable exception is the generator. Under this exception, a generator may treat
lead-contaminated waste or lead-contaminated debris in containers or tanks in compliance with part 265, subparts
I and J, and within the accumulation time limit of 90 days as specified in 40 CFR 262.34 (see 51 FR 10168, March 24, 1986).
On August 18, 1992, EPA promulgated the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) for hazardous debris (57 FR 37194). In that
rulemaking, hazardous debris is defined as solid waste with particle size 60 mm or larger. Therefore, paint chips,
paint dust, and sludge's would not be considered hazardous debris. As part of that rulemaking, the Agency promulgated
standards for a new hazardous waste management unit known as a containment building (40 CFR parts 264 and 265, Subpart
DD), which may also be used to treat waste at the generator facility without a permit, provided the waste is not held
longer than 90 days. If hazardous debris is captured, hazardous debris treatment technologies that may be used include
abrasive blasting, grinding or planing, vibratory finishing, high pressure steam, or water spraying to meet the
performance standard referred to as the ``clean debris surface.'' Other treatment technologies include macroencapsulation
or sealing (surfacial treatment) or microencapsulation (solidifying with portland cement or lime). Microencapsulation
could be done in tanks or containers. Hazardous debris is subject to compliance under the LDR treatment standards.
Many States are currently authorized to implement LDR requirements pertaining to lead-based paint activities under
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.

N. Applicability of RCRA to Lead-Contaminated Soil Near Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is possible that, when performing lead-based paint activities (e.g., HEPA vacuum removal or sand blasting of lead
paint) on public and commercial buildings, lead paint chips or lead dust hazardous under the TCLP would be released
and would either fall on the soil underneath or blown down wind before reaching the ground. This constitutes ``illegal
disposal'' of characteristic hazardous waste and is prohibited under RCRA sections 3004 and 3008. Therefore, individuals
engaged in lead-based paint activities must take appropriate precautions to contain lead dust releases during sand
blasting or when conducting activities that could potentially release significant quantities of paint dust leading
to its deposition on the soil near public and commercial buildings or superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the lead-based paint that is being removed exhibits the characteristic of toxicity for lead when conducting the
abatement or deleading, it would be necessary to take steps to prevent deposition on land by capturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead-contaminated dust and debris. If the abatement of deleading work resulting in land contamination is done without
a RCRA TSD permit, then this deposition would be inferred as ``illegal disposal.'' When conducting lead-based paint
activities, therefore, it would be necessary to take steps to minimize ``illegal disposal'' by capturing lead paint
dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues of concern for the Agency with regard to the enforcement of RCRA provisions for illegal disposal.
These issues involve the possible impacts on worker protection and how compliance can be achieved given existing
abatement and deleading technologies. Comments are requested on achievable methods to protect both the environment
and workers in light of existing abatement and deleading technology.

VIII. State Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This unit is comprised of two parts: (1) Procedures for States and Indian Tribes to follow in order to obtain authorization
from EPA to administer and enforce a lead-based paint activities program, and (2) a model program that will serve as
an archetype for these State and Tribal programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(a) of Title IV of TSCA provides that any State which seeks to administer and enforce the standards, regulations,
or other requirements established under section 402 or 406 may submit an application to the Administrator for approval
of such program. Section 404(b) states that the Administrator may approve such an application only after finding
that the State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program established
according to the mandate of section 402 or 406 of TSCA and that it provides adequate enforcement. The procedures for
submitting a State application are found in proposed &sect;745.325 of the regulatory text and are discussed in more
detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(d), directs the Agency to promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which seeks
to administer and enforce such a program. Given that section 404(a) requires that an authorized State program be at
least as protective as the Federal program, the Agency expects that a State program seeking authorization, would
resemble, in significant respects, the Federal program, and further, that the regulations found at proposed &sect;&sect;745.225
through 745.237 would serve as an appropriate model for such a State program. Therefore, the Agency is at this time
proposing these regulations as the model program for the regulations developed under section 402(a) of TSCA. The
regulations for section 406 of TSCA can be found at 40 CFR 745 subpart E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.225 of the regulatory text contains procedures for the accreditation of training programs for
lead-based paint activities. Proposed &sect;745.226 would establish procedures for the certification of individuals
engaged in lead-based paint activities, and proposed &sect;745.228 would establish standards for conducting these
activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Submission of State Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any State which seeks to administer and enforce the requirements of this proposed regulation or the regulation developed
under section 406 of TSCA would have to submit an application to the Administrator according to the procedures contained
in proposed &sect;745.325. No other political subdivision (e.g. cities, towns, counties, etc.) other than States,
as defined by section 3 of TSCA, and Indian Tribes, are eligible for authorization under this program. Following notice
and an opportunity for a public hearing, EPA would approve a State application within 180 days, if EPA finds that the
State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program, and it provides
adequate enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before developing an application for authorization, a State would publicly disseminate a notice of intent to seek
such authorization and provide an opportunity for public hearing. A State application would contain a copy of the
regulations and/or legislation establishing the State program, the name of the State agency that will administer
and enforce the program, as well as information on the resources that the State intends to devote to the program, and
an assurance that the State has or will have the legal authority necessary to carry out the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 404(a) of TSCA, at the time of submitting such an application, the State may also certify to the
Administrator that the State program meets the requirements of section 404(b)(1) and 404(b)(2) of TSCA. If this certification,
or certificate of compliance, is contained in a State's application, the State program shall be deemed to be authorized
by EPA, until such time as the Administrator withdraws the authorization. This certification would take the form
of a letter from the Governor or Attorney General to the Administrator, and would include detailed written justification
for concluding that the State's program is at least as protective as the Federal program. If the application does not
contain such certification, the State program would be considered authorized only after the Administrator approves
the State application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA invites States to submit their authorization applications at any time after the effective date of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA approval
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Within 180 days following submission of the application, the Administrator would approve or disapprove the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of a State that provides a certificate of compliance, the program would be immediately deemed approved.
In the case of a State application which does not contain a certification of compliance, the Administrator would approve
a State program only if, after notice and after opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator finds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program contained
in &sect;&sect;745.225 through 745.237 of the proposed regulatory text, or in subpart E ``Residential Property
Renovation,'' has been proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 separately from this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The State program provides adequate enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency would notify the State in writing of the Administrator's decision. Upon authorization of a State program
it would be unlawful, for any person to violate or fail or refuse to comply with any requirements of such program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision criteria above give the Agency reasonably broad latitude in approving or disapproving State programs.
Specifically, EPA interprets the standard ``. . .at least as protective as. . .'' to mean that a State program need not
be identical to, or administered and enforced in a manner identical to, the Federal program. The Agency expects to
receive applications for State programs that will differ in some respects from the Federal program. The Agency will
make every attempt to accommodate these differences while following the statutory requirement of ensuring that
every State program be at least as protective as the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon notification of authorization, the designated State agency within that State would be considered the approving
authority for purposes of training program accreditation, certification of individuals, and enforcement of this
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not have a State program authorized under this section and in effect by the date which is 2 years after
promulgation of this proposed regulation, the Administrator would, by such date, establish the Federal program
under subpart Q, or subpart E, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has received a number of comments from State representatives presenting concerns related to their potential
inability to introduce legislation and promulgate regulations for an entire training, certification, and accreditation
program that would cover target housing, public and commercial buildings, and superstructures within the TSCA Title
IV timelines. The Agency understands these concerns and is committed to devising a program that would promote State
adoption of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not have an approved program within 2 years, the Agency would be required to establish a Federal program
in that State. However, it was the intent of Congress, and is the policy of the Agency to encourage States to administer
and enforce this program at the State level. The Agency is seeking comment on how to best achieve this goal within the
2&hyph;year time frame mandated by TSCA while ensuring that all lead-based paint activities will be adequately regulated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Agency has received comment that there may be a need for Federal enforcement programs to be in place
even before State programs are enacted and authorized. It has been noted to the Agency that there may be the potential
for egregious or widespread releases of lead-containing materials by ``unregulated'' abatement actions during
the interim before State programs become effective. The Agency is confident that such situations can be effectively
addressed through the application of a combination of existing Federal, State and local statutes and regulations.
However, the Agency seeks comment on whether some or all of the requirements of the Federal program should be made immediately
effective following promulgation of the final rule, pending authorization of State programs.

. As required by section 404(c) of TSCA, if a State is not administering and enforcing its authorized program in compliance
with the standards, regulations, and other requirements of Title IV of TSCA, including section 404(b)(1) and (b)(2),
the Agency would so notify the State and, if corrective action is not completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed
180 days, the Administrator would withdraw authorization of such program and establish a Federal program pursuant
to Title IV of TSCA. Procedures for withdrawal of authorization can be found at proposed &sect;745.325(h) of the regulatory
text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Model State Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 404(d) of TSCA, directs the Agency to promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which
seeks to administer and enforce a lead-based paint activities program. Given that section 404(a) requires that an
authorized State program be at least as protective as the Federal program, the Agency expects that a State program
seeking authorization, would resemble, in significant respects, the Federal program. Therefore, the entire Federal
program for lead-based paint activities found at proposed &sect;&sect;745.225 through 745.237 is being proposed
as the Model State Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 745.225 of the proposed regulatory text contains procedures and minimum requirements for the accreditation
of lead-based paint activities training programs for workers, supervisors, inspectors and planners, and other
individuals involved in lead-based paint activities. These requirements include: (1) Minimum requirements for
the accreditation of training providers, (2) minimum training curriculum requirements, (3) minimum training hour
requirements, (4) minimum hands-on training requirements, (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements,
and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.226 contains procedures and requirements for the certification of individuals engaged in the
following activities: target housing and public building inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors, supervisors,
planner/project designers, and workers; and commercial building and superstructure supervisors and workers.
These procedures include specific training and, when appropriate, experience/education prerequisites that individuals
seeking certification would have. Additionally, this section specifies requirements for the certification of
firms involved in inspection and abatement activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;745.228 contains standards for conducting these activities. The standards for lead-based paint
activities are divided into three separate categories: target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings
and steel structures. In target housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The
second set of standards, for public buildings, cover the inspection, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition.
The final set of standards are for industrial settings. These include activities such as identification, deleading,
and demolition for commercial buildings and superstructures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency hopes that this model will be especially useful to the many States that do not currently have an existing
lead-based paint activities program. The Agency believes that adoption of this program would effectively reduce
the risks of lead-based paint activities. However, the State program need not duplicate the Federal program in order
to receive authorization from EPA. A State may choose to develop its own program, and it would be authorized if it is
as protective as the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major program elements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When developing a lead-based paint activities program, a State may choose to use the Federal program as a specific
model or it may develop its own program. For States that choose not to use the Federal program as a specific model, the
Agency has identified several major program elements below that a State program must have if it seeks to receive authorization
from the Agency to administer and enforce the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To administer and enforce such a program successfully, a State must develop the appropriate infrastructure. A State
program must establish a State agency or agencies, or designate an existing State agency or agencies to implement,
administer, and enforce the State program. Given the scope of the program, it is likely that more than one State agency
would be involved in the implementation and enforcement of this program. States are required to identify one State
agency or organization within a State (the primary agency) that would serve to coordinate the activities of these
agencies. States are also encouraged to, whenever possible, utilize existing State and local certification and
accreditation programs and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State program would require the certification of individuals and firms engaged in lead-based paint activities.
The program would establish training requirements for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The
training component of a State's program would require that training be provided by an accredited training program.
Proposed &sect;745.226 details the certification program developed by the Agency which may be adopted by a State,
or it may be used as a model for States developing their own certification program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State program would contain regulations or procedures for the accreditation of training programs. The regulations
or procedures would contain the following: (1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training programs;
(2) minimum training curriculum requirements; (3) minimum training hour requirements; (4) minimum hands-on training
requirements; (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements; and (6) minimum requirements for training
program quality control. The State accreditation program would contain the minimum requirements of the accreditation
program found at proposed &sect;745.225 of the regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency would establish standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account reliability,
effectiveness, and safety. The Federal program at proposed &sect;745.228 would establish specific standards for
performing these activities which a State program may choose to adopt. A State may also develop its own standards for
some or all of these activities, as long as they are judged by EPA to be at least as protective as the Federal standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, at proposed &sect;745.228(b), the Agency has developed procedures for conducting a risk assessment
in target housing. The goal of a risk assessment is to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location
of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings. Proposed &sect;745.228(b) specifically describes a method
of conducting such an assessment, and a State may choose to adopt this standard. A State may also develop its own procedures
that achieve the same goal. This is the case for all of the standards in this regulation. In general, the Agency has developed
specific standards that States may choose to adopt, or they may utilize their own standards, as long as they are at least
as protective as the EPA standards. The State agency or agencies would provide for the enforcement of the State certification
and accreditation program, and establish suitable sanctions for those who fail to comply with the program requirements.
This element of a State's program is essential because one of the Agency's two decision criteria for approval of State
programs is the adequacy of the State's enforcement program. Before promulgation of the final regulation, the Agency
anticipates developing a compliance and inspection strategy that would facilitate State implementation and provide
guidance in determining that the State programs provide adequate enforcement. The State agency or agencies must
have the authority to charge certification and accreditation fees. Section 402(a)(3) of TSCA states that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator (or the State in the case of an authorized State program) shall impose a fee on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) persons operating training programs accredited under this title; and (2) lead-based paint activities contractors
certified in accordance with [section 402(a)] paragraph (1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees shall be established at such a level as is necessary to cover the costs of administering and enforcing the standards
and regulations under this section [section 402] which are applicable to such programs and contractors. The fee shall
not be imposed on any State, local government, or nonprofit training program. The Administrator (or the State in the
case of an authorized State program) may waive the fee for lead-based paint activities contractors under subparagraph
A) for the purposes of training their own employees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will determine what fees it will impose pursuant to section 402 (a)(3) before the Agency begins to enforce and administer
the Federal program in any State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reciprocity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA strongly encourages each State to establish reciprocal arrangements with other States with authorized State
programs. Such arrangements might address cooperation in certification determinations, the review and accreditation
of training programs, candidate testing and examination administration, curriculum development, policy formulation,
compliance monitoring, or the exchange of information and data. The benefits to be derived from these arrangements
include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative activity and attainment of a more professional
workforce as States are able to refine and improve the effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and
methods of other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several elements of the EPA training and accreditation program at proposed &sect;&sect;745.225 through
745.226 that are intended to facilitate interstate reciprocity. The first, and most critical, is the certification
examination. The examination would serve to ensure that each individual who is certified under this program has a
minimum level of knowledge in his or her particular discipline. At the same time, the certification examination development
procedures would allow a State the flexibility to either adopt a ``standardized'' examination, or develop its own
examination according to ``standardized'' guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional element to facilitate interstate reciprocity, the Agency has proposed relatively specific minimum
curriculum requirements. A third element is the inclusion of a refresher training course in the Federal program.
Successful completion of a State accredited refresher course may serve as an ideal requirement for individuals seeking
a reciprocal certification in another State.

D. Indian Lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal also addresses implementation of sections 402 and/or 406 of TSCA on Indian lands. For the most part,
implementation of section 402 and 404 would be primarily a State responsibility. EPA would enforce a Federal program
only if it does not approve a State program or if it finds that a State program is inadequate. While Congress did not specifically
address implementation of Title IV on Indian lands, EPA has determined that proper lead abatement is as important
for Indian Tribes as for anyone else. Accordingly, EPA has decided to treat Indian Tribes as if they were States for
the purpose of administering and enforcing lead programs under sections 402 and 404.

, 480 U.S. 202, 216 and n.18 (1987). Furthermore, Congress has not created an explicit role for Tribes or the appropriate
Indian Governing Body to implement Title IV, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended
since 1986 (Safe Drinking Water Act, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, Clear Air Act). The term Indian Governing Body is used
throughout this proposal to mean the governing body of the Tribe, band or group of Indians subject to the jurisdiction
of the U.S. and recognized by the U.S. as possessing powers of self government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There exist three principal options for effectively ensuring comprehensive implementation of Title IV on Indian
Reservations: (1) Allow Tribes to apply for approval of section 402 or 406 programs in the same manner as States under
this proposal; (2) make determinations on a case-by-case basis whether the State has adequate authority to ensure
compliance with section 402 or 406 on Indian Reservations; and (3) make a blanket determination that States lack the
authority to implement their programs on Indian Reservations and that EPA would enforce sections 402 or 406 directly
on Indian Reservations in light of this determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the preferred approach would be to use a combination of options 1 and 2. Under this approach a State
may propose, as part of its program approval application, to ensure section 402 or 406 compliance on Indian Reservations.
The State would have to demonstrate adequate authority to ensure compliance with section 402 or 406 on the Indian Reservations.
The burden the State would meet to demonstrate its authority to regulate on Indian Reservations is a high one, however.
This type of demonstration of State authority over Indian Reservations is allowed, for instance, under regulations
for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program of the Safe Drinking Water Act as well as several other EPA programs.
40 CFR 125.24(b). See e.g., 45 FR 33378 (1980); 53 FR 43080 (1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the alternative, an Indian Governing Body could apply for authorization to run a section 402 or 406 program in the
same manner as a State pursuant to the procedures specified in this proposal. Where it does not do so, EPA would enforce
section 402 or 406 directly. Allowing for Tribal assumption of the section 402 or 406 program is consistent with EPA's
Indian Policy and existing practice for other environmental programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that adequate authority exists under TSCA to allow Tribes to apply for and receive authorization to run
Title IV programs. EPA's interpretation of TSCA is governed by the principles of

charged with implementing that statute may adopt any interpretation which, in the Agency's expert judgment, is reasonable
in light of the goals and purposes of the statute as a whole.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some tribes may entirely develop their own lead programs, other tribes may look to existing programs as a starting
point. Today's action does not require tribes to develop lead programs wholly from scratch. For example, a tribe could
negotiate a cooperative agreement with an adjoining State to jointly plan and administer lead programs that are appropriately
tailored to individual reservation conditions and tribal policies. Such an agreement would be subject to the review
and approval of EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another possible option includes incorporating standards from an adjacent State as the tribe's own, with appropriate
revisions that adapt the State standards to reservation conditions and tribal policies. Such adaptations would
build on State experience and expertise and might represent quicker and less costly ways to establish tribal programs
than developing tribal programs independently. This technique of utilizing small-scaled adaptations of State
programs would allow tribes to build experience and expertise that could later be used to revise existing programs,
if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smaller tribes may also wish to form consortiums or create inter-tribal agencies as ways to develop the necessary
expertise to administer lead programs in a cost-effective way. Aside from any formal arrangements between tribes
and States, EPA notes that the objective of this proposed rule is to provide for the safe, effective, and reliable abatement
of lead-based paint hazards. Therefore, EPA encourages all affected sovereigns to work cooperatively in informal
capacities to protect the public health and welfare from the serious health and welfare effects associated with lead-based
paint hazards. Consistent with EPA's interpretation of the application of Title IV to Indian lands, the proposed
regulations would permit the Agency to make grants to Indian Governing Bodies and States to implement authorized
Section 402 and 406 programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA specifically invites comment on its interpretation of the implementation of section 402 or 406 of TSCA on Indian
lands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

State programs may seek authorization of their programs pursuant to subpart Q effective date of promulgation of the
final rule. Subpart L of part 745 shall apply in any State that does not have an authorized program under subpart Q, effective
2 years after promulgation of the final rule. In such States: (1) Training providers shall not provide, or claim to
provide training for certification without accreditation from the Agency pursuant to &sect;745.225 after 2 years
and 180 days after promulgation of the final rule; (2) No person shall engage in lead-based paint activities without
certification from the Agency, pursuant to &sect;745.226 after 3 years after promulgation of the final rule; and
(3) All lead-based paint activities shall be performed pursuant to the standards contained in &sect;745.228 after
promulgation of the final rule. These dates should allow training providers sufficient time to receive accreditation,
and for individuals to then receive training from an accredited training program and obtain certification. The Agency
felt that because the standards in this regulation are being taught in the training courses, the standards should
only be enforced after individuals have received training and obtain certification. Upon promulgation, the Agency
will assess the number of programs that it must administer. If the demand for accreditation and certification is expected
to greatly exceed the Agency's capability to approve training providers and certify individuals, the enforcement
deadlines may be revised following appropriate public notice.

Introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in conjunction with this proposed rule. Ideally, when conducting
an RIA, a benefit-cost analysis which measures all marginal benefits and costs of the regulation should be performed.
Although it was possible to estimate the incremental costs, it was not possible to estimate incremental benefits.
Data limitations prevented a complete estimate of incremental benefits: The absence of the necessary dose-response
functions precluded the estimation of certain benefit categories (e.g., adult residential benefits and ecological
benefits), and knowledge of certain impacts (e.g., blood-lead levels with and without training) did not allow for
the estimation of the incremental benefits associated with this proposed rule. Therefore, an alternative approach
was employed whereby total measured benefits (i.e., benefits that have been identified and quantified) of the regulation
abatements were estimated to provide a perspective on the magnitude of the benefits against which to assess the possibility
of net benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major findings contained in the RIA are presented in this brief summary, organized into five sections appearing
below: Cost of Regulatory Action; Benefits of Regulatory Action; Benefit-Cost Analysis; Uncertainties and Sensitivity
Analysis; and Impacts of the Proposed Rule. The complete document, ``Title X Sections 402 and 404 Regulatory Impact
Analysis,'' is available for inspection in the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title X, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, amended TSCA by adding Title IV. The purposes
of Title X included a desire to develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based
paint hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible. Further, the Title X sought to encourage effective action
to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation
and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, is only one of the initiatives under TSCA Title
IV aimed at fulfilling these goals. EPA is currently developing or has developed other portions of this overall lead
hazard reduction program. For example, a required information dissemination program to inform the public of lead-based
paint hazards in the home during renovation has been proposed under section 406. A regulation developed under section
1018 of Title X will soon be proposed and would require the distribution of this pamphlet at the time of real estate transfer,
would require the disclosure of any known lead-based paint hazards and would allow the purchaser of real estate a 10&hyph;day
period to conduct a risk assessment of the property. Benefits of these actions flow from providing information describing
lead hazards to home owners renovating homes, home buyers, and renters. Costs of these actions include preparing
and disseminating information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 403 of TSCA requires that the Agency shall ``. . .promulgate regulations which shall identify. . .lead-based
paint hazards, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil.'' The section 403 regulations will represent
EPA's determination of those conditions that cause exposure to lead in paint, residential soil and dust that would
result in adverse human health effects. Benefits and costs accrue from the abatement of the identified lead-based
hazards, and lead-contaminated dust and soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although each of these initiatives have positive and negative impacts associated with them, the following narrative
focuses on those impacts resulting from the implementation of sections 402 and 404.

Cost of regulatory action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The total estimated incremental costs associated with this proposed rule are presented in Table 1. Cost estimates
are presented for two different abatement scenarios to present a range of possible costs: (1) Assuming abatement
occurs whenever X-ray Florescence (XRF) Analysis indicates a lead in paint level of greater than 1 (XRF 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1) and 500 parts per million (ppm) or more lead in soil (Scenario 1); and (2) assuming abatement occurs whenever X-ray
Florescence Analysis indicates a lead in paint level of greater than 6 (XRF 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6) for paint and 2,000 ppm or more lead in soil (Scenario 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead-based paint activities take place in target housing, as well as in public buildings constructed before 1978,
commercial buildings, and steel structures. Maintenance of steel structures such as bridges, water tanks, and electrical
towers may also involve activities affected by the proposed rules. Estimates of the costs of performing lead-based
paint activities pursuant to the proposed standards were based on a number of factors, including the number of lead-related
inspections, risk assessments, and abatement activities and the unit costs associated with such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incremental costs estimated to be incurred in association with the proposed rule have been grouped into three
categories: (a) Costs resulting from the imposition of the standards for conducting lead-based paint activities;
(b) costs resulting from the training and certifying of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities; and
(c) costs of establishing and operating State or Federal programs to administer and enforce the standards, regulations,
or other requirements established under this proposed rule. For each of these three categories of costs, total incremental
costs were estimated separately for the first year following promulgation (1994), and the present value for a 50&hyph;year
stream of costs discounted at 3 percent. (A 50&hyph;year stream was used because it was thought to provide a reasonable
estimate of the average life of a home, and a period beyond which discounted costs would have little impact on total
costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Scenario 1, total first-year incremental costs were estimated to be approximately $1.4 billion, while total
incremental costs, discounted at 3 percent over 50 years, were estimated to be $10.6 billion. Under Scenario 2, total
first year incremental costs were estimated at $.8 billion and total incremental costs, discounted at 3 percent over
50 years, were estimated at $6.2 billion. As may be discerned from Table 1, by comparing cost estimates for the two scenarios
presented, total costs decrease as abatement cut-offs increase (paint and soil lead concentrations), since fewer
structures and less soil would be abated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As demonstrated in the accompanying RIA, the standards for conducting lead-based paint activities are the main source
of costs, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the total incremental costs under both scenarios, due largely
to identification and inspection requirements and soil abatement. Under Scenario 1, the incremental cost of public
building identification is the greatest expenditure, accounting for 27 percent of the total incremental costs in
the first year of implementation and approximately 23 percent of the $10.6 billion total incremental cost. Under
Scenario 2, public building identification is again the greatest expenditure accounting for 47 percent of total
incremental costs in the first year of implementation and approximately 39 percent of the $6.2 billion total incremental
cost discounted over 50 years. The public building identification costs associated with the nonresidential sector
are high due to the assumed high level of activity in this sector during the first 3 years of rule implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training costs were estimated to be approximately 17 percent of total discounted costs for each of the scenarios.
Factors affecting the potential magnitude of training costs are frequency and duration of training, as well as the
number of potential trainees and associated productivity losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to State program costs, EPA found the one-time start-up costs to be the dominant factor. Owing to such start-up
costs, total first-year costs were estimated to be much larger than costs for any subsequent year. In developing its
total cost estimates for State programs, EPA assumed all States would establish such programs. While nothing in Title
IV requires States to seek authorization, the costs of EPA administration and enforcement were judged to be comparable
to State costs; thus, for the purposes of this analysis, this assumption is believed to provide a reasonable representation
of costs attributable to section 404.

Benefits of regulatory action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To most accurately estimate the benefits associated with this proposed rule, all private and social advantages of
the proposed rule's requirements would need to be identified and quantified. In particular, the incremental risk
reduction brought about by conducting lead-based paint activities using trained and certified individuals and
complying with the standards would need to be measured and valued as incremental benefits. Such risk reduction would
be the result of reduced lead exposure to residents of target housing; to occupants of and visitors to public and commercial
buildings; to risk assessors, inspectors, and abatement workers; to individuals in close proximity to lead-related
activities; and to the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total measured benefits (i.e., benefits that have been identified and quantified) associated with complete
residential abatement, include intelligence effects on infants and children, reductions in neonatal mortality
due to decreased exposure to pregnant residents, and benefits to workers of avoidance of the very high blood lead levels
associated with occupational exposure. (EPA also considered benefits resulting from reduced exposure to adult
residents. The results of these preliminary calculations are included in the sensitivity analysis below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total measured benefits estimated in this manner overstate actual benefits associated with the incremental improvement
imparted by the training, certification, and standards outlined in the proposal. EPA believes, however, that these
total measured benefit estimates when compared to the incremental cost are sufficient to provide the basis for an
informed decision. EPA requests comment, in light of the data limitations, on the value of this approach in evaluating
the potential effectiveness of this regulation. Further, the Agency requests the submission of any available data
that would facilitate the development of incremental benefit values for the requirements of this regulation as well
as incremental benefits and costs of alternative regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of this approach are presented in Table 2. The estimated discounted total measured benefits over 50 years
range from a low of $11.8 billion (abatement Scenario 2) up to $21.6 billion (abatement Scenario 1). The largest category
of benefits accrue in association with children's intelligence effects, with an expected 50&hyph;year benefit
of $11 billion to $19 billion, depending on the abatement scenario. Benefits realized in association with reductions
in neonatal mortality were estimated to range between $.8 billion and $2.6 billion, while benefits to workers were
estimated at $2.1 to $5.1 million, over 50 years. In addition, benefits to non-residential abatement workers were
estimated at $34 to $49 million.

Benefit-cost analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As shown in Table 3, total measured benefits are approximately double the incremental costs_the estimated incremental
costs of the regulation under Scenario 2, discounted at 3 percent and summed over 50 years, is estimated to be $6.2 billion,
and the estimated total measured benefits of the regulation, discounted at 3 percent and summed over 50 years, are
$11.8 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that the incremental costs associated with the nonresidential sector amount to nearly 58 percent of all costs
attributable to the rule and that the data limitations so severely restrict the benefit estimations for the nonresidential
sector, the base case analysis also compares total measured benefits and incremental costs on a per residential abatement
basis to gain additional insight to the impacts of the proposed regulation. In an effort to minimize the impact of the
above limitations on the assessment of net benefits, an additional comparison was made between benchmark total measured
benefits and incremental costs for a single residential abatement. As shown in Table 4, if only a small portion of estimated
total measured benefits, say 15 to 20 percent are attributable to the proposed rule, it is possible for the incremental
benefits to equal or exceed the incremental costs for paint abatement activities in the residential housing sector.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar comparison is not possible for the nonresidential sector because data limitations preclude benefit estimates
for this sector. This is not to imply that the benefits resulting from nonresidential abatements are insignificant.
All the benefit categories believed to result from public and commercial and steel structure deleading are identified
in Table 3. Available information regarding the scope of activity (and presented in the uncertainties section below)
would suggest that substantial benefits are likely to exist in the form of other worker benefits, benefits to nearby
residents, and ecological benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimate of the benefits would increase if all the omitted health and ecological effects were included. Even when
restricted to the limited coverage of the effects of lead paint exposure that are included in this analysis, it is possible
that the measured benefits associated with sections 402 and 404 will exceed the costs of the regulations. The measured
benefits of complete abatements are more than six times the incremental costs for Abatement Scenario 2. Thus if the
sections 402 and 404 rules increase the measured benefits of residential abatements (using current industrial practices)
by as little as 18 percent, the benefits would exceed the costs of the regulation. A benefits analysis that included
the significant omitted benefit categories would indicate that an even smaller percentage increase in the benefits
of current abatement practices would be sufficient to cover the costs of the regulation.

Uncertainties and sensitivity analysis uncertainties
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The development of the estimated costs for this proposed rule relied on three steps: The determination of ``common''
practices, a comparison of these practices to the requirements of the rule, and an estimation of the cost of the additional
or incremental activities. While there is a general uncertainty about all the estimates, this approach may have resulted
in an overestimate of the costs. In the case of the number of samples to be tested, the analysis included costs for the
full number of tests required under the regulation. Inspectors are already taking some samples, although some may
not take as many as the regulations will require. Lacking information on the typical number of samples tested, the
analysis included the costs for all the tests. Likewise, interviews with industry representatives indicated that
very few soil abatements were currently taking place. Therefore, the analysis estimated the rate of soil abatements
under the regulation based on estimates of household radon abatement. Since radon abatements are less expensive
than soil abatements, this assumption may have resulted in an overestimate of the number of soil abatements and thus
an overestimate of both benefits and costs. Both these issues are examined by the sensitivity analysis below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of the benefit estimates was also limited by numerous factors. It was not possible to include several
potentially major sources of health benefits at this time. Some of the major omitted benefits include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All benefits to adult residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All benefits to building occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All ecological benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the benefits in three of the five major categories, and part of the benefits to workers, result from changes affecting
abatements and deleading of public and commercial buildings and steel structures. As a result, the underestimation
of benefits has its greatest effect on the evaluation of the proposed rule's affect on nonresidential lead-based
paint activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The magnitude of some of these omitted benefits can be approximated by examining the extent of the likely exposure
and the nature of the resulting adverse effects. In the case of benefits to occupants of public and commercial buildings,
the potentially exposed population is very large. Over one-third of public buildings built before 1980 (approximately
900,000 buildings) have lead-based paint at an XRF reading of 1 or greater. In addition, about 27 percent of commercial
buildings (approximately 415,000 buildings) have lead-based paint at an XRF reading of 1 or greater. An equal percentage
(nearly 150,000) of industrial buildings also have lead-based paint at that level. Currently, these buildings result
in over one-half million deleadings per year. While the length of time of exposure for each individual building occupant
may be short, the number of exposed individuals is great, resulting in potentially substantial population risks
from improperly performed abatements. In addition, inadequate inspection and/or risk assessments could result
in much longer-term exposures if lead risks are not identified and abated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the deleading of steel structures mainly occurs out-of-doors, there is a significant potential of exposure
to the surrounding environment if deleading is not conducted properly. Currently, there are approximately 725,000
highway and railroad bridges, 30,000 water tanks, 75,000 petroleum and liquefied natural gas tanks, and 133,000
electrical transmission towers with lead-based paint that need repainting, and about 128,000 underground storage
tanks with lead-based coatings that need removal and demolition. While this analysis has not estimated the number
of people living in proximity to these structures, the large number of structures combined with the fact that many
are located in urban areas means that substantial numbers of people and large areas of ecosystems could be exposed
to lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adverse human health effects, lead can impose substantial adverse effects on ecosystems. Although
lead occurs naturally in the environment, it plays no known beneficial role in biological processes. In fact, lead
is a natural toxicant that affects a broad spectrum of species and persists in the environment. Elevated ambient lead
levels that are bioavailable can seriously disrupt population and ecosystem dynamics. As a result, lead is considered
a particularly hazardous ecotoxicant. While deleading of steel structures is likely to have the greatest impact
on ecosystems, improperly performed abatements in other nonresidential and residential buildings can also introduce
lead into the general environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to omitting benefits to occupants of nonresidential buildings, benefits to residents near steel structures,
and ecological benefits, the estimates presented in the RIA may underestimate benefits because of the assumption
made concerning which residential units will be abated. The analysis assumes that all the housing stock with XRF and/or
soil-lead levels greater than the scenario levels are eligible candidates for abatement, and that housing units
receiving abatements are twice as likely to have young children and newborns as the housing stock in general. This
second assumption captures the increased concern about lead hazards and children, and the increased benefits that
would accrue to households with young children. The increased concern will likely result in increased abatement
rates among housing units with children. However, there are no data currently available on which to base an estimate
of this increased likelihood of abatement, and the estimate used may be low. A low estimate will result in an underestimate
of the average residential unit benefits. (Likewise, a high estimate will result in an overestimate of the average
residential unit benefits.) In addition, if the likelihood of abatement increases with the level of lead present
in the home, which is very likely, the average per unit benefits of residential abatement will increase correspondingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data limitations have prevented the estimation of the relevant abatement demand and cost functions which are necessary
for accurately estimating the aggregate benefits and costs of the proposed rule. Adoption of the rule will impact
variables that affect both the demand and supply functions. For instance, in theory, the increase in abatement costs
resulting from training, accreditation, and standards required by section 402 will be reflected in an upward shift
of the supply function, increasing prices and resulting in a decreased demand. However, it is reasonable to expect
countervailing forces to exist. If people perceive that abatements performed by trained and certified contractors
are a better quality service than currently available, the demand for the improved abatements may increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to demand shifts as a result of section 402, informational sections of Title IV and Title X such as sections
405, 406, and 1018, respectively, will likely stimulate demand for abatements further. These actions provide information
and education to consumers about the inherent dangers of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net effect of these countervailing forces is difficult to predict with the limited information available. Data
limitations have also prevented an assessment of how the quantity of lead-based paint activities may change with
alternative regulatory options. Therefore, EPA has been unable to estimate the effect of more (or less) precriptive
approaches relative to the proposal on the quantity of lead-based paint activities. The Agency solicits comments
and suggestions about data sources or methods that may help in assessing the incremental benefits and costs of alternative
approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to deal with this issue, it is assumed that the demand for deleading in Massachusetts can provide a proxy for
estimating national demand after the regulation is in place. This is deemed appropriate since the training, accreditation,
and performance requirements (thus costs) for the established Massachusetts' program are similar to that of the
proposed rule. To the extent that residential abatements are mandatory in Massachusetts when elevated-blood-lead
(EBL) children are identified, the adoption of Massachusetts' abatement rates will result in an overestimation
of the number of national residential abatements. However, it is felt that overestimation will be minimal for the
following two reasons: information from the Massachusetts' Department of Health indicates that only 10 to 20 percent
of the residential abatements are a result of the presence of EBL children, and because it is likely that other States
will also adopt a mandatory abatement provision for EBL children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA knows of no other State programs that may provide additional insights to the expected impacts on demand resulting
from the implementation of the proposed rule and, therefore, solicits public comment on the existence of State programs
and relevant information germane to this issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sensitivity analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Six sets of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Two sets affecting only the costs are alternative costs of standards,
resulting from alternative estimates of unit costs or alternative assumptions of the number of events; and, alternative
training costs, resulting from alternative definitions of training requirements. There are two sets of sensitivity
analyses that affect the benefits while leaving the costs unchanged. These two analyses explore alternative levels
of benefits to adult residents of units abated and alternative value of a statistical life. And finally, there are
two sets of analyses that affect both the costs and the benefits. These use an alternative discount rate, and assume
alternative levels of abatement activity. The impacts of these variables on the estimated costs and benefits are
presented in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The greatest affects on the estimated benefits and costs are associated with the assumptions concerning choice of
discount rate and the rate at which soil abatements will occur. Since the benefits resulting from the proposed regulation
will not occur simultaneously with the costs, it is necessary to compare streams of costs with the resulting streams
of benefits. This is done by discounting future costs and benefits and summing the discounted values. Two alternative
approaches were investigated: using 7 percent in place of 3 percent to reflect an alternative social rate of time preference,
and using a two-stage procedure that allows for the use of two different discount rates: marginal rate of return on
capital (7 percent) for annualizing the capital costs; and a social rate of time preference (3 percent) for discounting
the stream of annualized costs and benefits. The distinction between these two approaches rests with whether the
source of funds for lead-based paint activities are displacing investment or consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Simply discounting the stream of costs by 7 percent decreases the total 50&hyph;year cost estimate by 27 percent.
At the same time, increasing the discount rate to 7 percent substantially decreases the estimated benefits more than
the cost, because many of the benefits will occur further in the future. There are potentially two separate effects
of changing the discount rate. First, the benefits per abatement decrease for all the quantified benefit categories
except for workers benefits and the present value of the 50&hyph;year benefits decreases for all the benefit categories
(including workers). The combination of these two effects decreases the present value of the 50&hyph;year benefit
stream by 87 percent. Consequently, the choice of discount rate affects benefits to a much greater extent than it does
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the two-stage discounting procedure are very sensitive to the amortization period (the length of time
capital is diverted from investments). Given the uncertainties about the appropriate amortization period, 50&hyph;year
discounted costs were not calculated. However, as demonstrated in the literature the two-stage results will fall
between the single discount rates of 3 and 7 percent used in these analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most important elements used in estimating the benefits is the willingness to pay to avoid a unit reduction
in the risk of death, also referred to as the value of a statistical life. The value of a statistical life directly enters
the calculations of the benefits of the avoided neonatal mortality, adult resident hypertension related benefits
(when included), and worker benefits. The results presented in base case are calculated using a value of $5.3 million
per statistical life. The standard deviation of these values is $3.8 million. A useful range of alternative values
for sensitivity analysis is mean value minus one standard deviation, and the mean value plus one standard deviation.
The range of alternative values of a statistical life is therefore $1.8 million to $9.1 million. Use of this range will
have a significant effect on neonatal mortality benefits. However, the alternative values do not alter the overall
benefit estimates greatly; the present value of benefits per abatement and of total benefits (over 50 years, discounted
at 3 percent) changes by plus or minus 5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary analysis relies on Massachusetts and OSHA data to estimate most of the levels of abatement activity, in
terms of the number of inspections, and abatements/deleading, under the proposed regulation. The Massachusetts
and OSHA data provide little information regarding the number of soil abatements. For estimates of rates of soil abatement,
therefore, the analysis relies on information on rates of radon abatement. The primary analysis assumes a similar
response rate to the presence of lead in soil as to the presence of radon in soil. In other words, 20 percent of the soil
inspections that determine the presence of lead result in a soil abatement. The sensitivity analysis assumes two
alternative abatement rates (84 and 10 percent) which reflect likely response rate extremes. For target housing,
the lead paint abatement rate was 84 percent. If individuals respond to the presence of lead in the soil similarly to
interior lead paint, then the soil abatement rate also will be 84 percent. The 10 percent alternative is examined because
based on the radon abatement experience, the 20 percent abatement rate used in the primary analysis may be too high.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the level of soil abatement activities will affect training, standards, and state costs at an 84 percent
abatement rate, the total cost of the regulation will increase by 26 percent, with standards costs increasing 32 percent.
Using a 10 percent abatement rate the total costs will decrease by only 4.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the level of soil abatement activities also changes the estimated benefits. The per-abatement benefits
do not change from performing an interior-only, soil-only, or combined paint and soil abatement. However, the average
per-abatement benefits change when the number of soil (and paint and soil combined) abatements change. At an 84 percent
abatement rate, the total measured benefits will increase 30 percent; and using a 10 percent abatement rate will result
in a 5 percent decrease in total measured benefits.

Impacts of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In assessing impacts of the proposed rule, EPA focussed on the potential of the rule to affect international trade
and to impact technological innovation. The distributional consequences of regulation (environmental equity)
were also investigated. (Small business impacts, assessed pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, were
also assessed. The results of this analysis are presented in unit X. of this preamble.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to international trade impacts, EPA examined the affected industries to determine whether the extent
of foreign trade merited a detailed examination of potential impacts. Since the industries directly affected by
this proposed rule are service industries, marketable goods would not be produced for trade. The reduction in lead-based
paint hazards expected is achieved through the identification and abatement of lead-based paint structures in the
United States and, therefore, will have no implications for international trade. Thus, EPA concludes that there
is no appreciable international trade in these services.
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the proposed rule's potential impacts on innovative activity, EPA believes that certain requirements
are likely to encourage innovation, while others may be a hinderance. For example, an area where innovation might
be encouraged is in the case of testing to determine the presence of lead. The standards require that the presence of
lead be determined by a test that produces discrete measures. While this proposed rule does not prescribe or prohibit
any particular practice, it does require that certain results be achieved. Thus, in setting criteria for new approaches
in this case, the proposed rule does not eliminate the potential for innovation by requiring the use of any particular
method, such as XRF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key factor in EPA's investigation into the distributional impacts of the proposed rule was the distribution of
lead-based paint in the nation's housing stock. Lead-based paint is more common in older, low-cost housing units
in the Northeast and Midwest. Because such housing units tend to be occupied by households at or below the poverty level,
including a disproportionate share of African-Americans, these subpopulations are exposed to relatively more
risks than other subpopulations. While these sub-populations would be likely to receive a greater portion of the
overall risk reduction benefits of the rule, the fact that most abatements are voluntary suggests that wealthier
households will be more likely to proceed with abatements. Unfortunately, data are not available to permit estimates
to be made of the demand for abatement given differing household income levels; thus, the distribution of benefits
and costs across geographic and demographic lines were not estimated.

G. Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 409 of TSCA makes it unlawful to fail or refuse to comply with any provision of a rule promulgated under Title
IV of TSCA. Therefore, failure to comply with any provisions of the final rule would be a violation of TSCA. In addition,
section 15 of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by section
11 of TSCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Violators may be subject to both civil and criminal liability. Under the penalty provision of section 16 of TSCA, any
person who violates section 15 or 409 is subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation. Each day a violation
continues may constitute a separate violation. Knowing or willful violations of any provision of the final rule could
lead to the imposition of criminal fines of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 1 year for each violation. In addition,
other remedies are available to EPA under sections 7 and 17 of TSCA, such as seeking an injunction to restrain violations
of the rule and seizing any imminently hazardous chemical substance. Section 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person''
who violates various provisions of TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as well as companies
or Federal facilities. In particular, EPA may proceed against individuals who report false or misleading information
or cause it to be reported.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 14 of TSCA, a person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any public comments submitted
to EPA in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a public comment for which a claim of confidentiality
has been made must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information
when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim information in comments confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining
it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject
to a claim of business confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.
If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA,
EPA will make the information public without further notice to that person by placing the comments in the public docket
for this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under E.O. 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive
Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines ``a significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result
in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it will have an annual effect on the economy of over $100 million annually. As such, this action was
submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations, have
been documented in the public record.

Introduction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) requires regulators to analyze impacts on small entities. EPA conducted
such an analysis, including it as part of the RIA. Based on this analysis of available data, EPA preliminarily concludes
that the proposed rule should not place undue burden on small business. The analysis is summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Impacts on Small Businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA assessed potential impacts, both absolute and relative burden, on small abatement firms in the construction
industry. To examine the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small abatement establishments, compliance costs
as a percentage of operating costs were estimated for both small and large firms and then compared to determine if small
firms are more adversely impacted than large firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance costs consist of two components: (1) Licensing and training costs for workers and supervisors, as
well as licensing costs for firms, and (2) incremental costs of performance standards for abatement procedures.
These two components coincide with the two decision points faced by firms interested in performing lead-based paint
abatement work (including soil abatement). In order to be a ``player'' in this industry, a firm must be licensed and
its employees must be trained and certified. It is likely that a firm will incur these expenses in anticipation of work,
based on its assessment of the future demand for such services, its competition, and the price it will be able to charge.
Therefore, the firm may incur the costs with no opportunity to recoup them, thus decreasing its profits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second set of costs, those resulting from performance standards, are of a different nature. The firms that do lead
abatement work also perform similar work in settings that do not involve lead and are not affected by the proposed rule.
These costs occur at the second decision point. They will be incurred by a firm only if it chooses to undertake a given
lead-based paint job. In each case, the firm can determine the impact of the performance standards on its sales and
profit levels. If the impact will be undesirable (e.g., decrease profit levels), the firm can decline the work. In
this voluntary setting, the performance standards will not have an impact on the profits of small businesses. Likewise,
owners of property will incur the performance standards costs only if abatements are in their benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comparison of incremental training and licensing costs to the estimated operating costs for an average small firm,
for each SIC group involved with lead abatement, is shown in Table 7 below. These SIC groups cover abatements in residential,
public, commercial, and industrial buildings, as well as steel structure abatement and deleading. Assuming that
none of the training and licensing costs are shifted forward in the form of higher prices, the ratio of compliance costs
to operating costs for small establishments range between 1.2 and 3.2 percent. Cost ratios are similarly estimated
for large establishments in Table 8 below. For large firms, the ratios tend to be slightly lower, ranging from1.0 to
2.3 percent. For both large and small establishments, the largest cost ratio occurs for SIC 1721, painting contractors.
However, for these firms, a large non-lead paint market is available. In all cases, compliance costs equal a small
percentage of operating costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this shifting of costs will alleviate the burden on abatement and deleading firms, the incremental costs of
the regulations may affect residential and commercial building owners. Consistent with the arguments presented
above, under this proposed rule abatement is a voluntary action. As such, a landlord is unlikely to undertake an abatement
unless he or she is able to pass the cost on to his or her tenants or otherwise recoup the costs in terms of higher property
values. EPA is concerned about the possibility that landlords of marginally profitable property, under the threat
of civil suits may chose the alternative of abandoning the property rather than incur the cost of abatement. EPA solicits
comments providing data or methods any such effects on the removal target housing from the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative indicator which demonstrates potential impacts on small abatement firms focuses on profitability.
EPA subtracted estimated establishment compliance costs from average profits per establishment to determine post-compliance
profits. This calculation was also performed separately for small and large establishments for the same SIC codes
identified above assuming Scenario 1 (See Tables 9 and 10 below). The estimated average adjusted profits for small
establishments in two of the nine affected industry sectors become negative. One of these sectors, Miscellaneous
Trade Contractors, was assumed as the most likely to perform a high frequency of very costly soil abatement projects;
thus, compliance costs exceeded profits by more than a factor of 10. For 3 other sectors, compliance costs represented
more than 50 percent of abatement establishment profits. For large firms, the results of this calculation indicated
the typical large firm to remain profitable in all sectors. Thus, based on the profitability indicator size of deleading
firms entering the abatement industry may be impacted by this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These calculations on profits assume all costs were absorbed by affected firms. This is more reasonable in the short
run than in the long run. EPA does not have the necessary information to ascertain the cost pass through rate and resulting
impacts on individual firms in the short run. Also, the analysis was constrained to use SIC data that are from a set of
firms that may be different from firms complying with this proposed rule and, therefore, the financial information
may not be representative of potential abatement firms. EPA solicits comments on available data to estimate these
impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two indicators presented above were selected to present the likely bounds of the impacts associated with the proposed
rule. The actual impact will likely lie somewhere between these extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comparison of impacts on small and large training providers was not performed for two reasons. Except for the RLTCs,
most training providers are small, so there would be no differential effect based on size of the firm. In addition,
it is likely that the training providers will pass the additional costs on to their trainees. Since the changes will
be required by Federal regulations, they will apply to all training providers. Second, there will be heightened concern
about lead-based paint hazards and thus a greater willingness to pay for trained personnel who will presumably provide
higher quality services. In fact, these regulations are likely to create a market for training services and thus will
be beneficial to small businesses.

The Information Collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR)
document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 15 USC 2682 and 15 USC 2688) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information
Policy Branch, (2136) EPA, 401 M st., SW Washington DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 2.67 hours per response while the estimated
recordkeeping burden was estimated to be 0.32 hours per response. These estimates include time to review instructions,
search existing data sources, gather and maintain the data needed, and complete the collection information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, (2136) EPA 401 M St., S.W., Washington, DC 20460, marked
``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to OMB or public comments on the information collection
requirements contained in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation includes a number of reporting and record keeping requirements, which are designed to help EPA verify
compliance with the rule after it is promulgated. This analysis identifies the reporting and record keeping requirements
specified in the proposed rule and estimates the burden and cost that these requirements will impose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation will add to the reporting and recordkeeping burden for three entities: states, training providers,
and lead inspection and abatement firms. Where applicable, burden numbers were based on those developed for the Asbestos
Model Accreditation Plan (MAP)(U.S. EPA, 1993b). In all other cases, burden numbers were estimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reporting burdens presented are classified into two groups: initial and annual. The burden associated with the start-up
efforts of states, training providers, and lead inspection and abatement firms are referred to as the initial burden.
For the purpose of this analysis, all of these efforts are assumed to be completed during 1994, the first year of the
rule. The burden associated with reporting requirements that will be required on an annual basis are referred to as
the annual burden and are presented based on the projected activity level for 1994. Initial and annual estimates are
combined to project the burden and costs that will be imposed during the first year of the rule, while the annual costs
alone serve as an estimate of the burden level expected during the second year (and subsequent years) of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first and second year burden estimates for all entities subject to reporting requirements under this rule, were
estimated to two abatement scenarios of XRF

2,000 ppm. With regard to the first abatement scenario, during the initial year of the rule the burden is projected
to be 11.4 million hours and $228.8 million. Assuming all entities seeking accreditation and certification are in
place during the first year of the rule, the burden estimate associatedwith the second year (and all subsequent years)
is projected to be 10.8 million hours and $217.6 million. At XRF

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2000 ppm, the total burden for the initial year is estimated to be 6.2 million hours and $126.1 million. For the second
year, and subsequent years, the total burden is 6.1 million hours and $120.9 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the burden, for both abatement scenarios, falls on lead abatement firms and is driven by the reporting
requirements associated with on-site lead-based paint activities. Because this burden is driven by the number of
lead-based paint projects, it is expected to decline substantially in subsequent years.

500 ppm represent the worst-case scenario due to the number of events that occur. Total annual costs are estimated
to be approximately $1.3 million.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule establishes regulations for seasons, harvest limits, methods, and means related to taking of
wildlife for subsistence uses during the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year. This rulemaking is necessary because
subpart D regulations require annual public review. When final, this rule making will replace hunting and trapping
regulations in ``Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart D_1994&hyph;1995 Subsistence
Taking of Fish and Wildlife Regulations,'' which expire on June 30, 1995.

 Written public comments and proposals to change this proposed rule will be accepted through November 11, 1994. Federal
Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) will hold public meetings on this proposed rulemaking
from October 3&hyph;November 4, 1994, at the following locations in Alaska: Anchorage, Barrow, Bethel, Fairbanks,
Galena, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Naknek, Nome, and Sitka. Written proposals to change subpart D regulations will be compiled
and distributed for additional public review during the second week of November 1994. A second 30-day public comment
period will follow distribution of the compiled proposal packet. Written public comments on distributed proposals
will be accepted during the second public comment period. Comments on proposals to change subpart D regulations may
be presented to the Regional Councils at their meetings. The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) will deliberate and
take final action on proposals received that request changes to this proposed rule at a public meeting to be held in
Anchorage during April 1995.

Proposed Changes From 1994&hyph;1995 Seasons and Bag Limit Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart D regulations are subject to an annual cycle and require development of an entire new rule each year. Consequently,
this proposed rule reflects regulation changes for the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year that are approved by the Board.
Regulations contained in this proposed rule will take effect on July 1, 1995, unless elements are changed by subsequent
Board action following the public review process outlined herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D final rule served as the foundation for the 1995&hyph;1996 subpart D proposed
rule. Minor editorial changes to the 1994&hyph;1995 final rule have been made to clarify and enhance Federal subsistence
management program regulations for the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year. The other proposed regulatory changes
include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 15, 1993, the Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of a number of individuals and organizations, submitted
a petition to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they include navigable
waters within the definition of ``public lands'' as used in implementing Title VIII. This was a request for administrative
relief. The Secretaries continue their evaluation of this petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 30, 1994, the U.S. District Court for Alaska issued a decision in the consolidated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Katie John, et al. v. the United States, et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation. The court concluded that the Secretaries are entitled to manage fish and wildlife on public lands in Alaska
for the purposes of providing the subsistence priority mandated in Title VIII of ANILCA. The court further concluded
that, for the purposes of Title VIII, ``public lands'' includes all navigable waterways in Alaska. The court then
issued a stay of the decision for 60 days to allow the filing of an appeal and ordered that the stay would remain in effect,
pending an appellate decision, if one or more appeals were filed. Because the Federal government has successfully
petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal from the district court's decision, the stay
presently remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the petition for rulemaking is still under consideration by the secretaries and because of the stayed court
decision relative to actual Federal jurisdiction, the Board believes that issuing regulations immediately, assuming
additional authority or revising existing regulations are not warranted and, in fact, appear to be inappropriate
at this time. However, any comments or proposals received will be carefully considered and retained for use when the
regulations are revised the next time. Therefore, the existing fish and shellfish regulations were extended (59
FR 32923, dated June 27, 1994) until December 31, 1995, or until the Secretaries direct the revision of the subsistence
fish and shellfish regulations based on a revised area of jurisdiction, or until the court directs the preparation
of regulations implementing its order.

At this time, Federal subsistence management program regulations apply to all non-navigable waters located on public
lands and to navigable waters located on the public lands identified at 50 CFR 100.3(b) and 36 CFR 242.3(b) of the Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964) published May 29,
1992. Nothing in these regulations is intended to enlarge or diminish authorities of the Departments to manage submerged
lands, title to which is held by the United States government.

Pursuant to the Record of Decision, Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, April 6, 1992, and
the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 36 CFR 242.11 (1992) and 50 CFR 100.11 (1992),
and for the purposes identified therein, Alaska has been divided into ten subsistence resource regions, each of which
is to be represented by a Regional Council. Charters for these Regional Councils were approved and signed by former
Secretary Lujan on January 19, 1993. The Regional Councils provide a forum for rural residents with personal knowledge
of local conditions and resource requirements to have a meaningful role in the subsistence management of fish and
wildlife on Alaska public lands. The Regional Councils have a substantial role in helping residents of the region
reviewing this proposed rule and making comments on it. Presently, the Regional Councils are composed of no fewer
than seven and no more than thirteen members who are residents of the region and are knowledgeable of local subsistence
concerns. Regional Council members serve a three-year term with one-third of the terms expiring annually. An extensive
recruitment effort for new Regional Council members occurs each fall. The Regional Council members represent varied
geographical, cultural, and user diversity within each region. Moreover, the Council Chairs present their Council's
recommendations at the Board meeting in April 1995.

A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence
Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues
associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments and staff
analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts
A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the
proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence
hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February
28, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence
Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior,
with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service,
to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative
framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940&hyph;22964, May 29, 1992) implements
the Federal Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting
and fishing regulations.

Compliance With Section 810 of ANILCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands
a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to
conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process.
The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence
Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may
have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence
uses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval
under 44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements
described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0075.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average .1382 hours per response, including time for reviewing
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form. Direct comments on the burden
estimate or any other aspect of this form to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849
C Street, NW, MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project
(1018&hyph;0075), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information collection requirements may be imposed if Local
Advisory Committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act are established under Subpart B. Such requirements
will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments
have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount
of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant
positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the
fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses
of public lands indicates that they will not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612.
Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of
this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings
implication relating to any property rights as outlined by Executive Order 12630.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area, which consists of those portions of Units 20, 24, 25, and 26 extending
five miles from each side of the Dalton Highway from the Yukon River to milepost 300 of the Dalton Highway, is closed
to the use of motorized vehicles, except aircraft and boats, and to licensed highway vehicles, snowmobiles, and firearms
except as follows: The use of snowmobiles is authorized only for the subsistence taking of wildlife by residents living

(C) The Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area, which consists of those portions of Unit 23, except the Baldwin
Peninsula north of the Arctic Circle, Unit 24 west of the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area, and Unit 26(A),
is open to brown bear hunting by State registration permit in lieu of a resident tag. No resident tag is required for
taking brown bears in the Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area, provided that the hunter has obtained a State
registration permit prior to hunting. Aircraft may not be used in the Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area
in any manner for brown bear hunting under the authority of a brown bear State registration permit, including transportation
of hunters, bears or parts of bears. However, this does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by
regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this
area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Upward Bound Program. These regulations are needed
to further implement statutory changes made to the Upward Bound Program by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992,
and to clarify and simplify certain requirements governing the program. The selection criteria, prior experience
criteria, and grantee accountability provisions are affected by these proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes and allowable activities of the Upward Bound Program support the National Education Goals. Specifically,
the program funds projects designed to increase high school graduation rates, increase competency over challenging
subject matters, encourage more students to pursue programs in mathematics and science, and help gain parental participation
in the social, emotional and academic growth of their children.

The Upward Bound Program provides grants to institutions of higher education; public and private agencies and organizations;
combinations of institutions, agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools under special circumstances.
The purpose of the program is to generate the skills and motivation necessary for success in education beyond high
school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 1, 1993, the Secretary published revisions to the Upward Bound Program regulations to implement changes
required by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (58 FR 51520&hyph;21). This NPRM proposes program improvements
that were not covered by the October 1, 1993 regulations. The major provisions of these proposed regulations include
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions (&sect;645.5).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations revise or add definitions to clarify certain terms used in the regulations, including definitions
of ``participant,'' ``independent student,'' and ``organization/agency.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Kinds of Projects (&sect;645.10).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations will define in general the three types of Upward Bound projects supported under the program,
i.e., Regular Upward Bound projects, Math and Science Upward Bound projects, and Veterans Upward Bound projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upward Bound services and activities (&sect;&sect;645.11&hyph;645.14).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 645.11 of the proposed regulations lists the services that all Upward Bound projects must provide. Section
645.12 describes the manner in which services are provided in Regular Upward Bound projects. Section 645.13 lists
additional services that the Math and Science Upward Bound project must provide and the manner in which services are
provided. Section 645.14 lists additional services that the Veterans Upward Bound project must provide.

How does one apply for an award? (&sect;&sect;645.20&hyph;645.21).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 645.20 of the proposed regulation describes the condition under which the Secretary will accept more than
one application from an eligible applicant. Section 645.21 describes the assurances an applicant must include in
an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection criteria (&sect;645.31).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations revise the order, weighting, and content of application selection criteria. The purpose
for this revision is to simplify and clarify the review process and increase grantee accountability. In addition,
the proposed regulations clarify and strengthen the requirements for a grantee's evaluation of a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prior experience (&sect;645.32).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations revise the criteria for the evaluation of a grantee's prior experience to focus on project
outcomes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project size (&sect;645.43(a)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations establish a minimum number of participants residing in the target area who must be served
by a project in each budget period, and permit that number to be reduced if the grant amount for the budget period is less
than $190,000. The proposed regulations require that Veterans Upward Bound projects serve at least 120 participants
during each budget period, and that all other Upward Bound projects serve at least 50 participants in each budget period.
Coupled with the new definition of ``participant'' in &sect;645.6 and the new recordkeeping requirements for participants
in &sect;645.43(c), this provision is intended to ensure that projects provide a reasonable level of services to
a significant number of recipients. This intended result is consistent with section 402A(b)(3) of the HEA, which
establishes a $190,000 minimum grant level for awards beginning in fiscal year 1994, unless the applicant requests
a lesser amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project period (&sect;645.34).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations implement a statutory provision that expands the project period to four years_or five years
in the case of applications that receive peer review scores in the highest 10 percent of all scores for approved new
projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Clarity of the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping
and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be
easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol
``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;645.20. (4) Is the description of the proposed regulations
in the

 section of this preamble helpful in understanding the proposed regulations? How could this description be more helpful
in making the proposed regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations
easier to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern whether these proposed regulations are easy to understand should also be sent to
Stanley Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Room 5125,
FOB&hyph;6), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are small institutions of
higher education, other agencies and organizations, and secondary schools that receive Federal funds under this
program. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the small entities affected because
the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The
regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 645.4, 645.31, 645.32, and 645.43 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions of higher education; public and private agencies and organizations; combinations of institutions,
agencies, and organizations; and secondary schools are eligible to apply for grants under these regulations. The
Department needs and uses the application data and information to make grants. Annual grantee reporting is estimated
to average 40 hours per response for over 600 respondents, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirement should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20504; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.

In accordance with &sect;&sect;353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the regulations, an interested party may request in writing
that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must specify
for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a review,
and the requesting party must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or resellers.
If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer if that
producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin, and
each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which reseller(s)
and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic
interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 1, 1994, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 33955) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan
(July 19, 1985). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under &sect;353.2(k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded
neoprene laminate from Japan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this
antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan. This merchandise
is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 5602.10.00, 5906.91.20, 5906.91.25,
5906.99.20, 5906.99.25, 5911.10.20. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written
description remains dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1994. Entries made during the period July 1, 1993 through
June 30, 1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct
the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated
antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 24, July 8 and 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 32686, 35112 and 36168) of proposed additions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
military resale commodities and services, fair market price, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Committee has determined that the military resale commodities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
military resale commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current contractors for the military resale commodities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the military resale commodities and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the military resale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Military force reductions in Europe have resulted in diminished military medical services for many areas, particularly
those where the active duty end strength has fallen below levels which would support a military health clinic. Service
members and their families, particularly those in remote areas, have experienced significant access problems in
areas where military medical services have either been substantially reduced or eliminated. Although some military
families currently use civilian providers, differences in U.S. and local national billing practices have resulted
in payment delays which are unacceptable to host nation providers. Because local systems are not conducive to calculation
and collection of beneficiary deductibles and cost shares, these payments by beneficiaries are often overlooked
or substantially delayed and have become a source of major dissatisfaction among local providers. As a result, some
local providers have indicated they are no longer willing to accept CHAMPUS patients while others have begun to require
payment for services in advance. This demonstration is proposed for the purpose of testing whether special agreements
with host nation medical providers and elimination of CHAMPUS deductible and cost shares can enhance beneficiary
access to required care. Although earlier demonstration proposals for Europe limited participation to medically
remote or underserved areas, payment issues which have become barriers to access affect all active duty families
in Europe who must seek care in host nation hospitals and clinics. For this reason, the demonstration is proposed for
the entire region. Demonstration participants will include family members of all active duty personnel in the uniformed
services located in countries served by OCHAMPUS EUROPE. Under Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1092, the Department
is authorized to test different methods of financing delivery of health care services under CHAMPUS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning 1 October 1994, active duty family members in countries served by OCHAMPUS EUROPE who cannot obtain required
services in military hospitals and clinics may obtain those services from civilian providers without paying cost
shares and deductibles normally required under standard CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries other than active
duty family members are not eligible for participation. Standard CHAMPUS is still available for individuals who
do not qualify under this program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this CHAMPUS demonstration, active duty family members who are unable to access services in a military medical
treatment facility (MTF) may obtain both inpatient and outpatient services through local national medical facilities.
Where possible, written agreements will be executed between these local national medical facilities and elements
of the uniformed services in areas served by OCHAMPUS EUROPE. Care received under this demonstration project would
require neither the cost share nor the deductible normally collected for inpatient and outpatient services under
standard CHAMPUS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the primary demonstration component, elimination of CHAMPUS cost shares and deductibles, applies to all active
duty families, development of referral networks and agreements with host nation providers will be phased, with earliest
attention directed at remote or underserved areas which have experienced significant reduction or elimination
of military medical services. Initial development of referral networks and agreements will occur in Germany.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Demonstration participation will be restricted to active duty dependents. Active duty service members will be included
in provider agreements; separate procedures and funding will be used to account and process payment for care rendered
to active duty personnel as required by current regulation. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
Affairs) will act as executive agent for purposes of this demonstration and will assume overall responsibility for
demonstration policy, implementation, and monitoring.

DURATION:

 This demonstration will operate for one year with two additional option years. Continuation of the program will depend
on a program evaluation conducted toward the end of the first year of operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is our hypothesis that specific agreements with local national providers will clarify relationships and forge
stronger links between U.S. and host nation providers. These links will become more critical as troop withdrawals
continue to affect U.S. military medical presence and capabilities in Europe. Elimination of the beneficiary cost
share and deductible should ease a major source of conflict with respect to payment of host nation providers, thereby
improving access to care for our beneficiaries. A decreasing military presence in Europe can be likened to a shrinking
``market power'' and, hence, less capability for area commanders to negotiate favorable arrangements and/or access
to local civilian medical services. Formal agreements which clarify DoD's commitment to payment procedures and
deadlines and a streamlined administrative process without copayments and deductibles should provide positive
incentive for local facilities to accept CHAMPUS beneficiaries.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action analyzed by this document is the disposal and reuse of the Tacony Warehouse facility, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania as required by the Defense Authorization Amendments and the Base Closure and Realignment Act (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;526). The Army will dispose of an approximately 14 acre parcel of land with improvements. The Fort Dix
Directorate of Public Works has been maintaining the facility since closure in September 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternatives are expressed in terms of Army imposed conditions for real estate disposal. An ``Unencumbered Alternative''
represents the ability to turn over the property with no Army imposed conditions. An ``Encumbered Alternative''
deals with property transferred with conditions imposed by the Army. This may be due to mitigation required by another
regulatory agency or may be required to protect Army interests. Council on Environmental Quality and Army regulations
implementing the National Environmental Protection Act require a no-action alternative as a benchmark against
which proposed actions are evaluated. For this document, this is the ``Caretaker'' alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Unencumbered Alternative'', the ``Encumbered Alternative'', and the ``No Action Alternative'' (Caretaker)
have been addressed in the Environmental Assessment (EA). In the ``Unencumbered Alternative'', the facility will
be available for reuse under a range of projected levels of reuse. Those projected levels of reuse are: High Intensity
Use, Medium Intensity Use, Low Intensity Use and Open Space.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High Intensity Use is defined when all of the property is offered for sale for a light industrial/commercial reuse.
There would be renovation of existing structures to house a light industrial/commercial enterprise. Some construction
activities, including building office and showroom space, will be performed within existing structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medium Intensity Use is when all of the property is used as a regional distribution center. The facility's area of distribution
will be the Mid-Atlantic States region. There will be renovations of existing structures and renovation of the rail
lines entering the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low Intensity use would occur if all of the property is sold or transferred for reuse as warehouse. An example of Open
Space is when the remainder of the parcel will be transferred to the city for use as an outdoor recreation area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land use in the ``Encumbered Alternative'' is similar to ``Low Intensity Use'' addressed in the ``Unencumbered Alternative.''
The identified encumbrance is associated with groundwater remediation activities and will restrict use of groundwater
for human ingestion or industrial purposes. Additionally, the 0.9 acre parcel adjacent to the state owned boat ramp
will be transferred to the Pennsylvania Fishing Commission as part of the boat ramp parking and picnic area. In the
no action alternative, also known as the ``Caretaker'' alternative, the Army will retain and close the facility.
The structures will be allowed to stand, with minimum maintenance activity conducted at the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal of Tacony Warehouse would not result in significant environmental or socioeconomic impacts. The transfer
of 0.9 acres to the Pennsylvania Fishing Commission will have no impact on the environment since the activities and
conditions at the 0.9 acre site will not change as a result of the transfer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Army Environmental Center studies have identified the extent of contamination at the site. A remediation plan was
prepared and coordinated with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources. The following remediation has been planned: Removal of underground storage tanks and above ground storage
tanks; replacement of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated transformers; asbestos removal and management;
steam cleaning of contaminated building surfaces; contaminated soil and sediment removal; and groundwater collection
and monitoring. Since the structures on the property were constructed prior to 1978, the potential for lead based
paints exist. The Army does not plan to remove any lead based paint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reuse of the property will have potential impacts to air quality, water quality, soils, and hazardous and toxic materials.
The extent of these impacts will be dependent on: (1) The extent of renovation, demolition, and construction activities;
and (2) the products produced and stored at the facility. High intensity reuse and Open Space reuse, addressed in the
``Unencumbered Alternative'', will have the greatest impacts on these resources. Best management techniques will
lessen the impacts of construction and renovation. Prior to and during operations, consultation will occur with
environmental resource agencies, as required, to ensure compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations
and guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increases to the facility's utility usage and the surrounding traffic patterns as a result of reuse will not pose a
significant impact to the surrounding community. No plant and animal ecologies exist on the property. No cultural
resources exist on the site to be affected by reuse. The State Historic Preservation Office has concurred with the
Army's determination that no historic properties exist on the site. Since the disposal of Tacony Warehouse does not
constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the human environment, an Environmental Impact Statement
will not be prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice of extension of closing date is to allow the public_particularly school officials, teachers,
and college and university faculty_additional time to prepare and submit their comments. Many of these educators
only very recently became aware of the notice and will not be able to meet the September 6, 1994 deadline. Also, many
other potential commenters have been away from work during the comment period (summer months) and have neither received
nor been given information on the public notice. An extension of the comment period will permit many more educators
and other interested parties to submit comments and recommendations.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 17, 1994, the Department of Education published an application notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting applications for schools to participate in the second year of the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan)
Program, which is the academic year beginning July 1, 1995. The notice pertained to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan
Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, and the Federal Direct PLUS Program, collectively
referred to as the Direct Loan Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rolling application and selection process for this program was described in the February 17 notice, which specified
October 1, 1994 as the final deadline for application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many schools have indicated that they would like to apply for participation in the Direct Loan Program but are reluctant
to do so until they have had the opportunity to evaluate the program in progress. While the first year of the Direct Loan
Program began July 1, 1994, the academic year for many of the first-year schools does not begin until September. Therefore,
some procedures, such as funds disbursement and reconciliation, will occur at these schools for the first time in
September or October of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wants to ensure that schools have adequate time to evaluate the day-to-day administration of the Direct
Loan Program and to observe the benefits of the program for students and schools prior to applying to participate.
Therefore, the deadline to submit applications for the second year of the program is extended to November 1, 1994.

By the terms of the proposed AOC, these PRPs will together pay $7,803,386.11 to the Hazardous Substance Superfund
(Superfund). The $7,803,386.11 represents approximately 11.2% of the total anticipated costs for the Site upon
which this settlement was based.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections
106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight
costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste
the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified
by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response
costs for the Site ($69,594.403) by the total estimated volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons).
For parties paying a 30% premium, there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site
exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For
parties paying the 120% premium, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 10 announces its intent to delete the Allied Plating
Site (Site) from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this proposed action. The NPL constitutes
Appendix B to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated
pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
of 1980, as amended. EPA and the state of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) have determined that all
appropriate actions under CERCLA have been implemented and that no further cleanup of the Site under CERCLA is necessary.
Moreover, EPA and DEQ have determined that remedial activities conducted at the Site to date have been protective
of public health, welfare and the environment.

EPA Region 10 announces its intent to delete the Allied Plating site from the National Priorities List (NPL), Appendix
B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300, and requests comments on this
deletion. EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to human health or the environment, and places
these sites on the NPL. EPA has the discretion to use its authorities under CERCLA or RCRA, or to designate a state with
remedial authorities to accomplish appropriate cleanup at sites listed on the NPL. As described in &sect;300.425(e)(3)
of the NCP, sites deleted from the NPL remain eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that
conditions at the site warrant such actions.

Deletion of the Allied Plating Site from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual rights or obligations.
The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes to assist EPA management. As mentioned in Section II of this
Notice, 40 CFR 300.425(e)(3) states that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for future Fund-financed
response actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For deletion of this Site, EPA's Regional Office will accept and evaluate public comments on EPA's Notice of Intent
to Delete before making a final decision to delete. The EPA will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, addressing
significant public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A deletion occurs when the Regional Administrator places a final notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following site summary provides EPA Region 10's rationale for the intention to delete the Allied Plating Site
from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Allied Plating Site is located at 8135 Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) Boulevard, in an industrial and commercial
district of northeastern Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Site covers approximately 12 acres, and contained the buildings which formerly housed a plating operation and
a waste disposal area approximately 3 acres in size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1957, the buildings were leased for the operation of Allied Plating, Inc., a chrome plating facility which operated
from that year until 1984, when the company declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to 1969, wastewater from the facility was discharged to a swale leading to the Columbia Slough (an off-site water
body). After 1969, landfilling north of the property cut off natural drainage, and as a result the discharge of liquid
wastes from the plating facility created a lagoon on-site. The metals in the plating wastewater precipitated out,
forming a layer of plating waste at the bottom of the lagoon. Aerial photographs indicate that the lagoon covered approximately
3 acres during the time when the company was discharging plating wastes into the lagoon. After the company ceased its
discharges, the lagoon receded, leaving a small pond with the surrounding area covered with plating waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA conducted a Remedial Investigation (RI) at the Site between January 1990 and April 1992. The RI determined that
the Site contamination was mainly limited to the area formerly covered by the lagoon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the RI, the Site was evaluated for a potential Removal Action as part of the Superfund Accelerated Cleanup
Model (SACM) Program. The Site met the criteria for remediation under a Removal Action. This Removal Action took place
between October 20 and November 10, 1992. During the Removal Action, the pond was drained, and the pond sludges and
the plating waste in the surrounding areas were excavated and shipped off-site for disposal at Envirosafe Services,
Inc., in Grandview, Idaho (a facility identified by EPA as being eligible to receive CERCLA wastes). Approximately
1100 cubic yards of sludge and waste were excavated and disposed of in this manner. The Site owner also placed a deed
restriction on the Site property, preventing the use of the shallow groundwater beneath the Site. The RI had determined
that one well in this aquifer had nickel concentrations above drinking water standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the Removal Action, EPA conducted a risk assessment on the contaminant concentrations remaining in the
surface soils of the Site. Although the remediated area had been backfilled during the Removal Action by at least one
foot of rock, to be conservative in the analysis, it was assumed that there would be direct human exposure to the remaining
residual contaminant concentrations. The results indicated that the Removal Action achieved a site cleanup level
which left the health threat associated with site-related contaminants well below a 1&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 excess cancer risk. The remaining hazard index was 2 for a residential scenario and 0.2 for an industrial scenario.
A hazard index of 1 is the level where no toxic effects are expected to occur.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This residual contamination level is negligibly above levels that would allow for unlimited use and unrestricted
exposure. The Site was remediated to industrial standards. The Site is currently used for light industry and is expected
to remain so, given the historical land use in this area. In addition, although the remaining surface contamination
level had a residential hazard index of 2, the residual contamination is buried under one or more feet of crushed rock
used as backfill; therefore, no contact route exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA signed a Record of Decision for no further action at the Allied Plating Site on June 29, 1993. The Oregon Department
of Environmental Quality concurred with the no further action remedy selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the implemented remedy at the Allied Plating Site is protective of the public health and the environment.
All possible exposure pathways from contamination on-site have been addressed, including groundwater and near-surface
soils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A five year review is scheduled to be conducted at the Allied Plating Site by June 1998. If EPA determines that the remedy
is still protective of public health and the environment, no further five year reviews will be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA at the Allied Plating Site have been
completed, and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. The Oregon State Department of Environmental
Quality has concurred with this decision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA hereby approves TME&hyph;94&hyph;16. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the
number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described
in the application and in this notice must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA nonconfidential information
center (NCIC), Rm. ETG&hyph;102 at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following additional restrictions apply to TME&hyph;94&hyph;16. A bill of lading accompanying each shipment
must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that approved in the TME. In addition, the applicant shall
maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall make them available for inspection
or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.&blank; Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture.

The Agency reserves the right to rescind approval or modify the conditions and restrictions of an exemption should
any new information that comes to its attention cast significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities
will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.

<DOCTITLE>Massachusetts Marine Sanitation Device Standard for Coastal Waters of Westport; Notice of Determination</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 19, 1994, notice was published that the State of Massachusetts had petitioned the Regional Administrator,
Environmental Protection Agency, to determine that adequate facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment
of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for the coastal waters of Westport Harbor and the East and West
Branches of the Westport River that border the Town of Westport, within the State of Massachusetts (56 FR 36758). The
petition was filed pursuant to Section 312(f)(3) of Pub. L. 92&hyph;500 as amended by Pub. L. 95&hyph;217 and Pub.
L. 100&hyph;4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 312(f)(3) states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the effective date of the initial standards and regulations promulgated under this section, if any State determines
that the protection and enhancement of the quality of some or all of the waters within such States require greater environmental
protection, such State may completely prohibit the discharge from all vessels of any sewage, whether treated or not,
into such waters, except that no such prohibition shall apply until the Administrator determines that adequate facilities
for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for such water
to which such prohibition would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Massachusetts has certified that there are two pump-out facilities available to service vessels in the
Westport Harbor and the Westport River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pump-out facility No. 1, which is mobile, is located at the Town Pier on the north side of the Westport Harbor. This facility
has a holding capacity of 650 gallons and it is marked with a yellow and maroon U.S.EPA issued boat pump-out sign. The
hours of operation will be upon request during the summer season from Memorial Day through Columbus Day seven days
a week from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. by calling the Harbormaster's office at (508) 636&hyph;1105 or by radio on Channel 9 VHF.
The mobile boat pump-out has a draft requirement of 2 feet. Vessels located in waters with depths of less than 2 feet
may need to move to deeper water to be pumped out. The cost is free and will be absorbed through boating licenses for the
season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pump-out facility No. 2 will be established at Tripps Marina. The hours of operation during the summer season from
Memorial Day through Columbus Day are seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. There is no fee to use the pump-out facility. Tripps is the largest marina in Westport with
250 slips and 150 moorings. There are fuel facilities, on-shore toilet and shower facilities, and a waste oil receptacle
available to boaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Town operates and maintains a 1000 gallon above ground holding tank for septage with secondary containment on
the south side of Westport Harbor. The tank is located adjacent to the State Boat Ramp and may be accessed from the water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Septage is collected by Ocean Arks, Inc., a research facility located in Marion, MA. In the event that Ocean Arks, Inc.
ceases to accept the boat septage, the Town of Westport has a renewable contract with New England Sanitation, a licensed
septic hauler, located in Westport, MA. Septage that is removed by New England Sanitation will be treated at the Fall
River Wastewater Treatment Facility in Fall River, MA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 350 moored boats in the East Branch of the Westport River, 100 moored boats in the West Branch,
770 moored boats in the Westport Harbor, and approximately 20 transient vessels which enter the harbor each day through
the mouth of the harbor during the boating season. Westport is approximately 14 miles long, 5.2 miles wide, with a total
area of 57 square miles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments received by the Agency on the merits of the petition prior to the deadline for receipt of comments
as stated in the July 19, 1994

 ``Receipt of Petition'' notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on an examination of the petition, and its supporting information which included a site visit by EPA Region I
staff, and the fact that the Agency received no comments concerning the petition, I have determined that adequate
facilities for the safe and sanitary removal and treatment of sewage from all vessels are reasonably available for
the Westport Harbor and the East and West Branches of the Westport River that border the Town of Westport, within the
State of Massachusetts, to qualify as a ``No Discharge Area''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination is made pursuant to Section 312(f)(3) of Pub. L. 92&hyph;500, as amended by Pub. L. 95&hyph;217
and Pub. L. 100&hyph;4.

Pantelis Constantoulakis, Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc.: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Division of Research Investigations (DRI) of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) reviewed an investigation
conducted by Advanced BioScience Laboratories (ABL) into possible scientific misconduct on the part of Mr. Constantoulakis
while an employee of ABL at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. ORI concurred with the factual findings
as set forth in the ABL report, and finds that Mr. Constantoulakis committed scientific misconduct by falsifying
and fabricating data in biomedical research supported by a contract with the National Cancer Institute and by misrepresenting
his academic credentials for purposes of his employment under the contract. Mr. Constantoulakis accepted the misconduct
finding and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which Mr. Constantoulakis will not apply
for Federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for
a five-year period beginning August 2, 1994.

Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of
residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or
to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living offsite of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction
of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for
DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associates
(SC&amp;A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public
involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&amp;A will discuss project progress and responses
to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions
faced by SC&amp;A's project team.

3. A Survey of Geographic Influences on Women's Health_New_Marked geographic differences in cancer mortality,
notably breast cancer, have long been recognized. Reasons for these differences are unknown, but may include regional
differences in the prevalence of established risk factors (e.g. age at first birth) and hypothesized environmental
factors (e.g., pesticides). This project is designed to evaluate the contribution of these factors to observed geographic
patterns of mortality in women.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (59 FR 29916, 29925).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified, an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds
of performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate
in a quarterly performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
National Coalition for the Homeless 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Veterans Administration, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A&hyph;10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443&hyph;2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1&hyph;800&hyph;927&hyph;7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to David
Pollack at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed Interdepartmental Agreement on HUD's Indian Housing Program sets forth the working relationship
among the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health
Service (IHS) in the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHA) in conjunction with the planning
and construction of new housing developed with financial assistance of HUD's Indian Housing Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and guidelines
by which each of the three agencies will interact with Tribal governments and IHAs. The IA will be supplemented, as
necessary, by individual Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) developed between local decision makers and the specific
federal agencies assisting in the development of the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has been working with the BIA and IHS to revise the existing Interdepartmental Agreement which was
published in 1976 and has not been updated to meet the regulatory requirement revisions that affect federal tribal
interaction in the Indian Housing Program. The BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP) was eliminated from this IA
to streamline the agreement among all signatory agencies in the development of HUD Indian housing programs. It is
anticipated that the IHS and the BIA will be addressing the BIA-HIP separately. Other sections pertaining to program
procedures are more appropriately covered in the program handbook or program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA)
and have been deleted from the IA.

The purpose of the Interdepartmental Agreement (IA) is to set forth the working relationship among the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Indian Health Service (IHS) in
the delivery of services to Tribes and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) in conjunction with the planning and construction
of new Indian housing developments. The above agencies share a common goal to assist Tribes in improving their living
environment through the delivery of quality housing and infrastructure. This goal can be more readily achieved with
an efficient and integrated utilization of available resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interdepartmental Agreement establishes a general foundation for this cooperative effort and the guidelines

to support proposed housing project applications for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1.2&blank;Project Coordination. HUD will advise IHAs to use handbooks concerning procedures the IHA may use to
determine what assistance they need from the BIA and IHS. At the request of a Tribe through the IHA, the BIA (including
Area Road Engineers and Realty Officers) and IHS will provide, to the extent feasible, technical reviews and recommendations
on project planning, design and construction documents involving supporting infrastructure, and related requirements
at appropriate project review points. Appropriate project review points will be determined on a project by project
basis and may include: project coordination schedule review, housing site feasibility review, project plan review,
project final inspection, and record drawings review. Schedules or commitments made as a result of project coordination
require the approval of the appropriate IHS and/or BIA official.

4.1.3&blank;Standard vs Assisted Housing Development Method. The Standard Method of development refers to all
procedures, guidelines and requirements associated with the normal development of an Indian housing project by
an administratively capable IHA. The Assisted Method contains all of the procedures, guidelines and requirements
associated with the development of an Indian housing development by an IHA which has requested additional HUD assistance
due to its inexperience or lack of staff resources, or by an IHA which has been deemed by HUD to need additional assistance,
monitoring and supervision during the development process. The Standard Method will require less oversight by the
signatory agencies as compared to the Assisted Method.

On-Site Street Construction. HUD will provide sufficient funds for the construction of on-site streets, in accordance
with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. The IHA will have
the overall responsibility for construction of on-site streets. The Tribal government must determine the type of
streets to be constructed in conjunction with housing projects, and whether the streets will be included in the BIA
Roads System for maintenance by the BIA. HUD will advise each IHA and Tribe which receives a HUD Housing Grant that the
on-site streets must be designed and constructed to AASHTO standards to be eligible for inclusion on the BIA roads
system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2&blank;BIA RESPONSIBILITIES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1&blank;Access Road Construction. When requested by the Tribal government, the BIA will plan and construct
access roads to housing developments. Sufficient lead time is required to develop access roads. This lead time may
be as much as 21/2 years. The BIA will coordinate access road construction with the IHA and make every effort to complete
such roads prior to the completion of the housing project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.2&blank;Road/Street Maintenance. IHA-developed streets may be added to the BIA Roads System only when the street(s)
and related curb, gutters and drainage features have been built to acceptable AASHTO specifications and standards,
and the right-of-way is transferred to the BIA. When requested by the Tribal government, the BIA Area Office will accept
IHA developed streets on the BIA Roads System and will provide ongoing maintenance for those streets that meet the
above specifications and standards.

Each signatory agency (HUD, BIA, and IHS) shall be responsible for following its own applicable procedures addressing
the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and related and/or similar environmental legislation
and/or Executive Orders. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), dated June 21, 1991, signed by BIA, HUD, IHS, and
the Environmental Protection Agency clarifies each agencies' role in environmental protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the implementation of the roles identified in the MOU and the responsibilities assigned in the IA, to the extent
feasible, all signatory agencies will adopt and/or combine environmental documents that comply with NEPA and related
regulations, which are provided by the other signatory agencies, in order to reduce duplication and paperwork. Copies
of one signatory agency's environmental determination documentation (e.g., archeological review) may be required
by another signatory agency prior to granting approvals; however, the approving agency shall not require the applying
agency to change procedures, format, etc., during the review process and prior to granting its approval.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring an endangered or threatened species or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish them,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Leptocereus grantianus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a cactus endemic to the Culebra, a small island off northeastern Puerto Rico. Only one population is currently known
and consists of approximately 50 individuals. This spineless cactus, reaching up to 2 meters in height and 3 to 5 centimeters
in diameter, occurs in dry thickets along a rocky shoreline in southwestern Culebra. The populations is threatened
by agricultural, residential, and tourist development on the adjacent uplands, cutting for use as livestock feed,
damage from heavy storm surge, and possible collection.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft Recovery Plan for the sensitive
joint-vetch (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Aeschynomene virginica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The sensitive joint-vetch is an annual legume that occurs in intertidal areas along river systems in North Carolina,
Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. The species was listed as a threatened species in 1992 due to destruction and degradation
of its habitat. The primary recovery strategy for this species is to protect extant sensitive joint-vetch sites within
six watersheds in Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this
draft Plan.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare Recovery Plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery Plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for the recovery levels for downlisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The document submitted for review is the draft Sensitive Joint-Vetch (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aeschynomene virginica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Recovery Plan. The Sensitive joint-vetch is an annual legume of the bean family native to the eastern United States.
This species occurs in freshwater tidal river systems; currently, it is known from a total of 24 extant sites, including
one in New Jersey, one in Maryland, two in North Carolina and 20 in Virginia. Almost every population of this species
is subject to water withdrawal projects or habitat loss, modification, or degradation from development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of the sensitive joint-vetch recovery program is to protect, maintain, and increase the species and its habitat,
enabling eventual removal of this plant from the Federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. This
will be accomplished through habitat protection (preventing habitat destruction and deterioration) at the landscape
level and possibly by finding additional populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the
review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Comments Solicited

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent years, a significant number of carriers have had their operating authorities revoked and gone out of business
without canceling their tariffs. In the absence of formal cancellation action by the carriers, we have retained these
tariffs in the active tariff library. In our view, the retention of such tariffs in the active tariff library should
be discontinued since it imposes unnecessary storage costs and can mislead the public by indicating the availability
of service and pricing that no longer exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interstate Commerce Act does not permit a carrier to file tariffs covering service which it is not authorized to
provide. Thus, once a carrier's operating authority is revoked, there is no lawful basis for the continued existence
of any effective tariffs covering service formerly authorized by the revoked authority. We believe we can treat such
tariffs as cancelled whether or not the carrier whose operating authority is revoked takes formal action to cancel
them.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Carriers whose operating authorities are revoked are sometimes included as participating carriers in tariffs issued
by agents or other carriers who remain in business; however, the tariffs published by others can be, and generally
are, promptly revised to exclude the carriers whose authorities have been revoked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are numerous instances each year in which the Commission revokes carriers' operating authorities because
they fail to maintain insurance coverage as required by the Commission's regulations. In many instances, once the
carriers realize that their operating authorities have been revoked, they reinstate the required coverage and request
that their authorities be reinstated. As a matter of practice, the carriers have been allowed to reinstate operations
without being required to file new tariffs. In these revocations and reinstatements, however, the entire process
is typically completed within a few months, so the procedures announced in this notice, which provide that tariffs
will be deemed cancelled after 1 year of inactivity, will not affect current tariff reinstatement practices.

The Commission currently keeps cancelled tariffs at the Commission for three years after cancellation for use in
resolving rate disputes for past traffic. The tariffs are then stored for an additional seven years at the Federal
Records Center to satisfy Federal records retention requirements and to be further available for rate dispute resolutions.
The tariffs of a carrier whose operating authority has been revoked will be treated in the same fashion; the information
contained in them will be available for 10 years after the carrier's authority has been revoked.

The lines were not included in the final system plan at the time the Consolidated Rail Corporation was formed, and,
as such, were authorized to be abandoned without further Commission approval pursuant to the Railroad Revitalization
and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94&hyph;210. PennDOT acquired its line segment (a portion of USRA line 907/939)
from the Trustees of the Reading Railroad, and SEPTA acquired its line segment (a portion of USRA line 142) from the
Trustees of the Penn Central Transportation Company, after the respective lines were abandoned in 1976.

Issuance of this modified certificate was delayed because the Commission's records indicate that Octoraro, and
not SEPTA, is the owner of the 36.50-mile segment of USRA Line 142 extending between Wawa and Sylmar.

where Chester County, PA (Chester), was to acquire the line segment from SEPTA, and simultaneously sell it to Octoraro
in a series of transactions that were to be consummated on or about October 5, 1988. In clarification, SEPTA and Chester,
on August 18, 1994, jointly filed a verified statement declaring that the acquisition transaction in Finance Docket
No. 31254 was never consummated. They affirm that SEPTA continues to own the 36.50-mile line. Octoraro apparently
continued to operate the 36.50-mile line segment under the operating exemption previously granted in

Although Octoraro apparently has ceased operations, it has not sought discontinuance authority. Consequently,
Octoraro retains its common carrier obligation to provide freight service between Wawa and Colora, MD, under Finance
Docket No. 28334. To be relieved of that obligation, it must file a discontinuance application under 49 U.S.C. 10903
and 10904 or seek an exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision results in both Delaware and Octoraro being authorized to operate the line between Wawa and Sylmar.
This should not be a problem because the evidence of record indicates that future operations will be conducted by only
one carrier.

RAI owns and controls the following class III rail carriers: Huron and Eastern Railway Company, Inc. (operating in

(operating in Tennessee).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RAI states that: (1) The lines to be operated by Delaware do not connect with any of the other lines controlled by it;
(2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect Delaware with
any railroad in the corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the transaction
is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343.

In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Notice of Certification
Regarding Eligibility to apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on April 13, 1994. The notice was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24483).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, on its own motion, is amending the subject certification to include all workers of ARCO Natural Gas
Marketing, Inc., Dallas and Houston, Texas. New findings show that ARCO Natural Gas Marketing functions as part of
the production process for its parent company, ARCO Oil and Gas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of ARCO Oil and Gas who were affected by increased
imports of crude oil and natural gas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,431 through TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,435 is hereby issued as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All workers of ARCO Oil and Gas Company at the following locations: Atlantic Richfield Company, Dallas, Texas (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,431);
ARCO Natural Gas Marketing Inc., Dallas and Houston, Texas (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,431A&hyph;29,431B); ARCO Permian,
Midland, Texas (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,432) and operating in the following States: Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Texas; Atlantic Richfield Company, Houston, Texas (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,433) and
operating in the following States: Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; ARCO Western Energy, Bakersfield, California
(TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,434) and California except Bakersfield (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,434A) and ARCO Exploration and
Production Technology, Plano, Texas, (TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,435) who became totally or partially separated from
employment on or after February 21, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade
Act of 1974.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
By an application dated August 5, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject
petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on July 15, 1994 and published in the Federal
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38494).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The findings show that the headquarters for Nike, Inc., is in Beaverton, Oregon. The Beaverton workers are engaged
in marketing services, administrative functions, retail servicing and research and development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation findings show that Nike does not produce products directly but contracts with non-affiliated
firms for the production of athletic and casual footwear, apparel and sports accessories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the Beaverton workers do not produce an article within the meaning
of Section 223 of the Trade Act. The Department has consistently determined that the performance of services does
not constitute the production of an article as required by Section 222 of the Trade Act, and this determination has
been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only in very limited instances are marketing and other support workers certified for trade adjustment assistance
(TAA), namely the worker separations must be caused by a reduced demand for their services from a parent or controlling
firm or subdivision whose workers produce an article and who are currently under a certification for TAA. These conditions
were not met for the workers at Nike, Inc., in Beaverton, Oregon.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 19, 1994, the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice
of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on June 27, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36792).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners claim that they were affected by a shift in production to Mexico and consequently, increased imports.

After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA&hyph;W) issued
during the period of August, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) that sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.

The investigation revealed that criteria (3) &amp; criteria (4) were not met. There was no shift in production from
the workers' firm to Mexico or Canada during the relevant period. The investigation revealed that production declined
at the subject firm in 1993 &amp; during the first six months of 1994 &amp; that company imports &amp; beds &amp; accessories
increased during these time periods. However, the company imports were not from Mexico or Canada.

<DOCTITLE>Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program: Unemployment Insurance Program Letters Interpreting Federal
Unemployment Insurance Law</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Employment and Training Administration interprets Federal law requirements pertaining to unemployment compensation
as part of its role in the administration of the Federal-State unemployment compensation program. These interpretations
are issued in Unemployment Insurance Program Letters (UIPLs) to the State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs).
The UIPL described below is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 41&hyph;94
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This UIPL advises SESAs of the actions which must be undertaken by States in order to meet the requirements of Sections
303(a)(10) and 303(j) of the Social Security Act (SSA). Compliance with the provisions of the SSA is a condition for
the receipt of administration grants for the operation of the Unemployment Insurance program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) were added to the SSA by Public Law 103&hyph;152. Under Section 303(j), SSA, States
are required to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC in order to identify those
claimants most likely to exhaust regular UC and in need of reemployment services in order to obtain new work. Section
303(a)(10), SSA, also requires that an individual identified pursuant to the profiling system must participate
in reemployment services as a condition of UC eligibility.

3. Background. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 24, 1993, the President signed into law the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1993 (P.L. 103&hyph;152)
which added Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j) to the SSA. Both of these new sections contain requirements States must
meet as a condition of States receiving UI grants. (The text of both sections is contained in the Attachment.) Under
Section 303(j)(1), SSA, the State must: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UI 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment. (Subparagraph (A) of
section 303(j)(1), SSA.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Refer the claimants so identified to reemployment services, such as job search assistance services, available
under any State or Federal law. (Subparagraph (B) of Section 303(j)(1), SSA.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Collect follow-up information relating to the services received by such claimants and their employment outcomes
and use the information for future profiling. (Subparagraph (C) of Section 303(j)(1), SSA.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meet ``such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor determines are appropriate.'' (Subparagraph (D)
of Section 303(j)(1), SSA.) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Section 303(a)(10), SSA, requires claimants to participate in reemployment services to which they
have been referred as a condition of UI eligibility. P.L. 103&hyph;152 requires the Secretary of Labor to provide
technical assistance and advice to the States in implementing the worker profiling systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the principal aims of the profiling system is to provide reemployment services to certain claimants through
an ``early intervention'' processes. That is, claimants who are unlikely to return to their previous jobs or occupations
will be identified and given assistance early in their claims series. This approach is expected to facilitate an early
return to employment and savings to each state's unemployment fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this legislation, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) has launched a major initiative to establish
an integrated, comprehensive worker profiling and reemployment services system involving various programs, including
the UI, Employment Service, and Title III, JTPA programs. To this end, information describing how a recommended integrated
system might operate was issued to the States through the Department's Regional Offices. (This recommended system
followed the overall approach embodied in the proposed Reemployment Act of 1994.) However, since the SSA amendments
create specific requirements as a condition of receiving UI administrative grants, it is necessary to provide guidance
to States concerning what actions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be taken concerning the UI program. This issuance provides definitive guidance concerning these actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other things, this UIPL describes the minimum required profiling system for identifying and referring claimants.
That the States must use this required profiling system does not, however, abridge the States' authority to use other
methods, not related to the minimum system, for identifying claimants for referral. For example, assuming a service
provider has twenty-five slots, a State may refer only fifteen claimants identified under the minimum required profiling
system to the provider if the State also refers ten claimants using whatever methods it deems appropriate.

Overview of Profiling and Reemployment Services System. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal law does not specify a detailed structure for the profiling and reemployment services system. That is left
to the States. However, in order to meet the statutory requirements and coordinate between the various employment
and training programs, the Department anticipates that the following general structure will be used by all States:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The UI agency will profile all claimants to identify those likely to exhaust regular UI and in need of reemployment
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To the extent that reemployment services are available, the ``identified'' claimants will either be immediately
referred to these services or placed in a selection pool from which a referral may later be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Services will begin with an orientation session advising claimants of the availablility and benefit of reemployment
services, and, if appropriate, an individual assessment of each claimant's needs. Based on an individual service
plan, the claimant may be referred to reemployment services tailored to the individual's needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The entity providing the reemployment services will promptly provide the UI agency with any necessary information
relating to the claimants' continuing eligibility for UI.

Arrangements with Service Provider(s). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the authority granted by Section 303(j)(1)(D), SSA, which allows the Secretary to establish other requirements
as are determined appropriate, the Department has determined that State UI agencies are to establish certain arrangements
with the entities providing reemployment services. When the UI agency is not part of the same overall State agency
as the service provider (for example, an employment security agency or executive department), the Department recommends
that these arrangements be in a written agreement. Arrangements must be made in two areas: The number of claimants
to be referred to the provider and the information the provider must forward to the UI agency.

Number of Claimants Referred.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The burden of reporting to service providers should not be placed upon claimants when services are not available.
Similarly, service providers should not be required to expend time and resources working with referred claimants
when services are not available for them. Therefore, there must be a balance between the available supply of services
and referrals to these services. To avoid excessive referrals, the agreement must provide a method for assuring that
the number of claimants referred to the provider is based on the number the provider is able to serve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 303(j)(1)(B), SSA, only requires the referral to ``available'' reemployment services of claimants identified
as likely to exhaust regular UI and who need job search assistance. Therefore, the State will meet the requirements
of Section 303(j)(1)(B), SSA, when the supply of services and referrals to these services is balanced.

Receipt of Information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New Section 303(a)(10), SSA, requires that claimants, identified and referred to reemployment services through
profiling, participate in such services, or in similar services, as a condition of UI eligibility. Also, Section
303(a)(1), SSA, requires ``methods of administration *&blank;*&blank;* as are found by the Secretary to be reasonably
calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due.'' This means the UI agency must have methods
of administration for obtaining eligibility information from service providers and for promptly determining eligibility
based on this information. To ensure service providers meet the UI agency's needs, arrangements must exist for the
prompt provision of any necessary eligibility information concerning participation or availability. States also
will need to establish methods of administration for obtaining this information when claimants are attending ``similar
services'' as discussed in item 11.b.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as discussed in item 12 below, States must provide information to this Department related to reemployment
services received by claimants and employment outcomes. Arrangements must be made for the provision of this information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reemployment services need not include skills and education training. Therefore, States are not required to apply
the participation requirement discussed in item 11.a. to such training even if claimants are referred to such training
through the worker profiling and reemployment services system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Orientation and assessment activities are both reemployment services for purposes of Sections 303(a)(10) and 303(j)
SSA. Orientation is a service since claimants are made aware of why services are available and what the services are
and, as a result, are able to participate in the identification of appropriate services to assist them in returning
to employment. Assessment is a service since it identifies the specific needs of each claimant. Assessment is also
listed as a reemployment service in the Committee Report.

Benefit Rights Interview (BRI).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, individuals who may be entitled to UI must be provided information
as will reasonably afford them an opportunity to know, establish and protect their rights under the UI law of the State.
Therefore, BRI information provided to claimants during the initial claims taking process must advise claimants
of the possible consequences of failure to report or to participate in any reemployment services to which they may
be referred.

a. Who is to be Profiled.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 303(j)(1)(A), SSA, requires that State agencies establish and utilize a system of profiling ``all new claimants
for regular compensation'' (i.e., regular UI) that ``identifies which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular
compensation and will need job search assistance services to make a successful transition to new employment.'' Based
on the plain language of Section 303(j)(1)(A), all claimants for regular UI must be profiled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``regular compensation'' is defined in Section 205(2), EUCA, as ``compensation payable to an individual
under any State unemployment compensation law (including compensation payable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 85),
*&blank;*&blank;* other than extended compensation and additional compensation.'' Through the reference to 5
U.S.C. chapter 85, the phrase ``all new claimants for regular compensation'' includes claimants filing for UI for
ex-servicemembers (UCX) and Federal employees (UCFE). The phrase ``all new claimants for regular compensation''
includes all intrastate, interstate and combined-wage claimants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will work with the States in developing arrangements for profiling interstate claimants. In determining
whether to take action against a State which is not profiling and referring interstate claimants, the Department
will take into account the feasibility of such State taking appropriate action.

Who is to be Identified.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The profiling system must be structured so as to identify which claimants will be likely to exhaust regular UI and will
need job search assistance services to make successful transition to new employment. If a claimant is not permanently
laid off, there is no need for job search assistance to make a ``transition to new employment'' and the likelihood of
exhaustion also decreases. Similarly, if jobs exist in the current industry or occupation, then the claimant is less
likely to exhaust and to need job search assistance to make a ``transition to new employment.'' The word ``transition''
as used in Section 303(j)(1), SSA, indicates that the requirement for participation in reemployment services is
not aimed at claimants who are merely between jobs in the same industry or occupation, but instead at claimants who
are having to make a ``transition'' to jobs in a different industry or occupation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of this analysis, the Department has determined the following minimum requirement: A State profiling
system must identify all new claimants for regular UI who are permanently laid off (and who are, therefore, likely
to exhaust). From the claimants so identified, the State must further identify at least one of the following: (1) Those
claimants who are unlikely to return to their previous industry or (2) those claimants who are unlikely to return to
their previous occupation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants identified under the minimum required profiling system described above will also be ``eligible dislocated
workers'' under Section 303(a)(1)(A) of Title III, JTPA. This section defines the term ``eligible dislocated workers''
to mean individuals who ``have been terminated or laid off or who have received a notice of termination or layoff from
employment, are eligible for or have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment compensation, and are unlikely
to return to their previous industry or occupation.'' Claimants identified through the minimum profiling system
described above are_as are certain ``eligible dislocated workers''_permanently laid off from employment, eligible
for UI, and unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation. Therefore, claimants identified through
the minimum required profiling system will also be ``eligible dislocated workers'' for purposes of Title III, JTPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How Claimants are to be Identified
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Variables. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of certain types of variables is required to ensure that claimants identified are permanently laid off and
unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation. The use of other variables is optional. In addition,
the use of certain variables is prohibited.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the minimum required profiling system, the following variables must be used:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
First Payment for Total or Part-Total Unemployment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since claimants cannot exhaust UI unless they are first eligible for UI, the use of this variable is required. Claimants
receiving first payments for partial claims are not required to be identified for referral since there has been no
separation from employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First payment to some claimants will occur late in their claims series due to appeals, wage investigations or other
causes. Since, as noted in item 8.a, ``all new claimants'' for UI must be profiled, claimants receiving late payments
must be profiled. However, given that the profiling system's goal of early intervention will not be achieved for these
claimants, States have the option of introducing an additional variable to the profiling system which would exclude
claimants who receive first payments after a certain period of time (for example, 5 weeks).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Recall Status: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since claimants who are on recall will not need reemployment services and are less likely to exhaust UI, the use of this
variable is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Hiring Halls: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Claimants making exclusive use of a union hiring hall will not need reemployment services since these claimants are
expecting to find work in their current occupation. If union hiring halls are used in the State, then the State must
use this variable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claimants remaining after these three variables are applied will be passed through either a statistical modeling
or characteristic screening process to determine difficulty in finding reemployment. (See item 8.c.(2) below.)
Following are variables which the Department has identified for use in this process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Education: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Educational level is closely associated with reemployment difficulty. Generally, claimants with less education
are more likely to exhaust. Use of this variable is a State option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Job Tenure: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a measure of a claimant's attachment to a specific employer. Studies show that the longer a worker's specific
job attachment, the more difficult it is to find equivalent employment elsewhere. Use of this variable is a State option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Industry: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A claimant's search for employment is affected by the former industry of employment. Claimants who worked in industries
that are declining, relative to others in the State, experience greater difficulty in obtaining new employment than
claimants who worked in expanding industries. States must use either this variable or ``occupation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Workers in low demand occupations experience greater reemployment difficulty than workers in occupations with
higher demand. States must use either this variable or ``industry.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Uemployment Rate: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Dislocation and reemployment difficulty are closely related to economic conditions, as measured by unemployment
rates. In areas with high unemployment, unemployed workers will have greater difficulty becoming reemployed than
those workers in areas with low unemployment, even if all other conditions are equal. Use of this variable is a State
option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To summarize, under the minimum required profiling system, States must use first payment, recall status, hiring
halls (if they are used in the State), and either industry or occupation to identify claimants for purposes of referral
to reemployment services. Using the above optional variables will decrease the number identified under the profiling
system; however, the result will be a greater precision in identification. The Department will notify States if any
additional optional variables are identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a profiling system may not produce results which discriminate in violation of any Federal or State law or
which otherwise unfairly favors some claimants over those similarly situated with respect to their need for reemployment
services. To this end, under the authority granted by Section 303(j)(1)(D), SSA, which allows the Secretary to establish
other requirements as are determined appropriate, the Department has determined that the following elements may
not be used in the profiling system: Age, race, ethnic group, sex, color, national origin, disability, religion,
political affiliation and citizenship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statistical Modeling versus Characteristic Screening. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Statistical modeling uses a set of variables in combination simultaneously. Each variable receives a weight (or
``coefficient'') that has been established by a statistical process. The weighted average produces a ranking. Characteristic
screening, on the other hand, uses each variable as an exclusion variable. That is, depending on whether the answer
is ``yes'' or ``no'' to a given question, claimants will be either included or excluded. Unlike statistical screening,
no ranking is produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referral to services based on statistical modeling will be based on a numerical score since the higher the score, the
more likely the claimant will exhaust and the greater the need for services. If claimants have the same scores, and
there are not sufficient opportunities to participate in reemployment services, States must randomly select among
those claimants for referral to assure claimants are treated equitably and the profiling system is legally defensible.
Since claimants identified through characteristic screening cannot be ranked, States using this system must also
randomly select from among the identified claimants for referrals. Under the authority granted by Section 303(j)(1)(D),
SSA, which allows the Secretary to establish other requirements as are determined appropriate, the Department has
determined that random selection is required for use in profiling systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department encourages the use of statistical models since they are more efficient and precise in identifying
claimants as well as easier to manage and adapt. However, States may use characteristic screening. Whichever system
is used, each State must assure that the system implemented in fact identifies claimants who are permanently laid
off and unlikely to return to work in either their previous industry or occupation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Selection Pool. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the profiling system anticipated by the Department (see item 4), all claimants identified in accordance with
the requirements of Section 303(j)(1), SSA, will be either immediately referred to reemployment services or, if
services are not available, placed in a selection pool. Claimants in the selection pool may be referred to services
at a latter date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the background section, early intervention is one of the principal aims of the worker profiling and reemployment
services initiative. Holding claimants in the pool for more than a minimum period of time will not achieve this early
intervention. Therefore, the Department recommends that claimants be removed from the selection pool after 4 weeks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department recognizes that large-scale permanent layoffs and plant closings do not occur at regular
intervals. Therefore, there may be times when a State elects to retain claimants in the pool for longer periods. States
may also elect to vary the length of time individuals are held in the pool by locality within the State.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjudication of Issues Associated With Profiling and Reemployment Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Participation Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 303(a)(10), SSA, creates a requirement that ``as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for
any week, any claimant who has been referred to reemployment services *&blank;*&blank;* participate in such services
or similar services.'' (Emphasis added.) The Department interprets the phrase ``for any week'' to mean that a claimant
must participate in reemployment services (as defined in item 6 above) only during the week or weeks that the claimant
is required to attend. Therefore, eligibility with respect to participation in reemployment services is determined
on a weekly basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants must be held ineligible for any week in which there is a failure to participate in reemployment services
which they are required to attend unless they: have justifiable cause, have completed such services, or are attending
similar services, as discussed below. Federal law does not require, however, that the maximum UI benefit amount be
reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal law does not require State UI laws to provide for a finding of ineligibility when claimants are no longer required
to participate. For example, a claimant may refuse to participate during one week and be held ineligible for that week.
If the claimant is required to participate the next week and again refuses, then the claimant will continue to be ineligible.
However, if the claimant is not required to participate the next week, then there is no failure to participate and the
State is not required to find the claimant ineligible. Similarly, a claimant who has refused to participate in available
services and has been held ineligible may later agree to participate. In this case, if the services are no longer available
to the claimant, Federal law does not require the claimant to be held ineligible for any additional weeks since there
is no longer a failure to participate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also no failure to participate when the service provider relieves claimants of the requirement that they
attend. This may occur when, for example, a claimant notifies a provider of an inability to participate due to a family
emergency and the service provider advises the claimant that it is not necessary to participate. (Note: This may raise
an availability issue for the week(s) in question. This is why service providers must provide information concerning
availability under item 5.b. above.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants are not required to be held ineligible if the failure to participate is minimal and does not significantly
affect their ability to benefit from the reemployment services in attempting to obtain new work. For example, if a
claimant misses one hour of an eight hour seminar, the State may find that this limited absence is not a failure to participate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Similar Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 303(a)(10), SSA, a claimant referred under the profiling system is not required to participate in reemployment
services if the claimant is participating in ``similar services.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Similar services'' are reemployment services that claimants are attending on their own initiative. Examples
of ``similar services'' include, but are not limited to, services offered by a company prior to a permanent layoff
or services offered by private employment agencies. The ``similar services'' need not be identical to those to which
the claimant was referred by the State; they need be only reasonably similar. The quality of the services being provided
should be a relevant factor in determining whether the services are ``similar.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, the UI agency is required to obtain and record such information
as will reasonably insure the payment of benefits to individuals when due. Therefore, the UI agency must perform sufficient
factfinding to determine if, in fact, the services are similar. This means the UI agency must determine, among other
things, to what services the claimant was referred and what the ``similar services'' are which the claimant is (or
will be) attending.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions to Participation Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 303(a)(10), SSA, contains two exceptions to the participation requirement. The first is whether the claimant
has completed such services. The second is whether ``justifiable cause'' exists for the claimant's failure to participate
in the services. (Note: As indicated in item 11.b, there is no participation requirement if claimants are participating
in similar services.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Completion of ``Such Services.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 303(a)(10)(A) provides that a claimant who has completed ``such services'' is not required to participate
in services to which the claimant has been referred. How recently the services were completed should be considered
in making this determination since, for example, certain approaches to finding a job may have changed due to changing
labor market conditions. Although the language ``such services'' appears to refer to those services to which the
claimant was referred, it is reasonable to also include the completion of ``similar services.'' Therefore, the Department
interprets Section 303(a)(10)(A), SSA, as allowing States to consider the completion of ``similar services'' as
the completion of ``such services.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Justifiable Cause. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 303(a)(10)(B) provides that a claimant who has ``justifiable cause'' is not required to participate in services
to which the claimant has been referred. As noted in (1) above, although the language ``such services'' appears to
refer to those services to which the claimant was referred, it is reasonable to also include the completion of ``similar
services.'' Otherwise, claimants attending ``similar services'' would not be relieved of the requirement to participate
when justifiable cause exists. Therefore, the Department interprets Section 303(a)(10)(B), SSA, as allowing States
to consider justifiable cause as a reason for not participating in ``similar services.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of ensuring consistency with Section 303(a)(10), SSA, States must apply the ``reasonable person''
test in determining if justifiable cause exists for failure to participate. That is, States must determine if the
reasons offered by claimants for failure to participate are such that a reasonable person would not have participated.
As in other areas where the ``reasonable person'' test is used, such as failure to report to the UI office as required,
States must expect the claimants take the actions a prudent and reasonable person would take prior to concluding that
participation is not possible. For example, although a reasonable person would not be expected to leave children
at home unattended, a reasonable person would also be expected to make an effort to obtain child care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A finding of justifiable cause will last only for the period the justifiable cause is relevant. For example, justifiable
cause due to short term illness will last only for the period of the illness. There may be cases when the State determines
that the justifiable cause continues for a longer period or through the life of the claim, for example, when the claimant
is in approved training under State law. (Note: The Department anticipates that claimants in approved training will
not be required to participate in reemployment services while they are in training.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation of Participation Requirement to Other State Eligibility Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending on the nature and extent of the reemployment services in which the claimant is participating, States should
apply other eligibility requirements in such a way as to not overly burden the claimant. For example, the State may
choose to reduce the number of work search contacts required or relieve the claimant of the work search requirement
during a period of participation in reemployment services, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in UIPL 13&hyph;94, Change 1, the justifiable cause exception does not supersede State able and available
requirements, but rather is an additional eligibility requirement related to participation in reemployment services.
Claimants may be determined to have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services; however,
they must still meet a State's able and available requirements to be eligible for UI. For example, although a claimant
who is ill may have justifiable cause for failure to participate in reemployment services, the claimant is still subject
to the State's able and available requirements and may, as a result, be ineligible for UI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Appeal Rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 303(a), SSA, any eligibility determination that a claimant has failed to participate
in reemployment services must be appealable. In addition, all determinations of UI eligibility must contain appeal
rights in accordance with the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although States must allow claimants to appeal denials for failure to participate in orientation and assessment,
States are not required to permit claimants to contest the propriety of the referral to orientation and assessment.
Orientation and assessment are aimed at determining what, if any, additional reemployment services may be needed
by the claimants. Obviously, if claimants do not report, this determination cannot be made. In this regard, referrals
to orientation and assessment are similar to reporting and ``call-in'' requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Claimants must, however, be allowed to question whether any services tailored to the individual are, in fact, needed.
If any evidence appears at any stage of the nonmonetary determination or appeals process indicating that the claimant
does not need these services, the UI agency must take the initiative in determining whether the referral was proper.
If it is found not to be proper, then the participation requirement does not apply and there is no need to address exceptions
such as justifiable cause.

Feedback and Reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 303(j)(1)(C), SSA, requires that States collect follow-up information relating to the reemployment services
received by the referred claimants and the employment outcomes for these claimants. This information is to be used
in refining the profiling system. Section 303(a)(6), SSA, also requires the States to provide ``such reports, in
such form and containing such information as the Secretary of Labor may from time to time require *&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these authorities, States will be required to submit information concerning profiling to the Department.
This UIPL does not address what information must be collected or reported. Specific instructions for reporting any
information on services and outcomes will be issued as changes to ETA Handbook 401, ``Unemployment Insurance Reports

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Proposed Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 C.F.R. Part 2570, Subpart B (55 F.R. 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions
of sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the past acquisition
of certain stock rights (the Rights) by the Plan pursuant to a stock rights offering (the Offering) by BMJ Financial
Corporation (BMJ) to shareholders of record as of February 9, 1993 of BMJ common stock (the Common Stock); (2) the holding
of the Rights by the Plan during the subscription period of the Offering; and (3) the past exercise of the Rights by the
Plan; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Plan's acquisition and holding of the Rights occurred in connection with the Offering made available to all
shareholders of the Common Stock;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Plan's acquisition and holding of the Rights resulted from an independent act of BMJ as a corporate entity,
and all holders of Common Stock, including the Plan, were treated in the same manner with respect to the Offering; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The authority for all decisions regarding the acquisition, holding and control of the Rights by the Plan was exercised
by an independent fiduciary which made determinations as to whether and how the Plan should exercise or sell the Rights
acquired through the Offering.

Summary of Facts and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. BMJ Financial Corporation (BMJ) is a bank holding corporation chartered in New Jersey, with its headquarters in
Bordentown, New Jersey. BMJ and its affiliates sponsor the Plan on behalf of their employees. In order to obtain additional
capital to comply with certain federal regulatory requirements governing minimum capitalization, BMJ determined
to issue stock rights (the Rights) in 1993. The Rights were issued to all holders of BMJ common stock (the Common Stock),
enabling recipients to acquire additional shares of Common Stock. Since the Plan was among the holders of Common Stock
when the Rights were issued by BMJ, the Plan received such Rights. BMJ requests an exemption to permit the Plan's past
acquisition and holding of the Rights under the circumstances and conditions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Plan is a profit-sharing plan that receives elective employee contributions pursuant to arrangements subject
to section 401(k) of the Code, and employer matching contributions subject to section 401(m) of the Code. Employer
matching contributions are paid in the form of Common Stock. As of December 31, 1992, the Plan had approximately 304
participants and total assets of $4,075,795.52. The Plan is administered by a committee consisting of six employees
and an outside director, each appointed by BMJ's board of directors (the Committee). The Committee directs the administration
of the Plan and possesses all powers necessary to carry out the terms of the Plan. The Bank of Mid-Jersey serves as the
current trustee (the Trustee) for the Plan, as directed by the Committee. In order to enable the Plan's active participation
in the Offering and to provide for independent representation of the Plan's interests with respect to the Offering,
certain amendments were made to the Plan's trust document (the Trust Agreement) prior to the Offering. The amendments
are described as follows: (a) The Trust Agreement was amended to authorize BMJ to appoint one or more investment managers
to manage the investment of all or a portion of the Plan assets; (b) The Trust Agreement was amended to require BMJ to
furnish to the Trustee the name of any Plan investment manager appointed by BMJ and to allow the Trustee to assume that
any such manager remains authorized to direct the Trustee until notified otherwise; and (c) The Trust Agreement was
amended to permit the Trustee to take any actions necessary to carry out the instructions of an appointed investment
manager properly authorized under the Trust Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the amendments to the Plan, BMJ entered into an agreement (the Appointment) with the Swathmore Group,
Inc. (the Fiduciary) providing for independent representation of the Plan with respect to the Offering. The terms
of the Appointment provide that the Fiduciary serves as an ``investment manager'' on behalf of the Plan, as that term
is defined in section 3(38) of Title I of the Act, with respect to the Offering. Under the Appointment, the Fiduciary
is granted, for the entire period of the Offering, the exclusive authority to direct the Committee with respect to
(a) All Rights issued to the Plan, (b) all Common Stock held by the Plan, and (c) the employer matching contributions
paid to the Plan in cash by BMJ and its affiliates on January 12, January 29, February 12, February 26, and March 12, 1993.
BMJ represents that the Fiduciary was selected to serve in this capacity because of its extensive investment experience,
its familiarity with securities distributions like the Offering, its prior experience as an investment manager
on behalf of plans subject to the Act, and its independence from all other parties to the transaction. The Fiduciary
represents that it is a registered investment advisor incorporated under the laws of Delaware, that it has substantial
fiduciary experience under the Act, and that it is independent of and unrelated to BMJ and its affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On February 9, 1993, BMJ had issued and outstanding approximately 4,365,295 shares of Common Stock, $1.00 par value,
of which 122,042.02 shares, or 2.80 percent, were owned by the Plan.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Executive officers of BMJ directly or indirectly owned, in the aggregate, 33,910 shares of the outstanding common
stock, excluding (1) Shares held by the Plan, (2) shares subject to stock options, and (3) shares held in certain trusts
established for the benefit of nonemployee members of the BMJ board of directors. Accordingly, as of February 9, 1993
the combined holdings of the Plan and BMJ's executive officers were approximately 155,952 shares, or 3.57 percent
of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, while unrelated persons held approximately 4,209,343 shares, or 96.43
percent, of the issued and outstanding Common Stock. Pursuant to a registration statement filed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission effective February 12, 1993, BMJ announced that it intended to distribute certain stock
subscription rights (the Rights) to BMJ's Common Stock holders, as part of a plan of recapitalization of BMJ and two
of its subsidiaries, the Bank of Mid-Jersey and Mt. Holly State Bank.

The applicant represents that the Common Stock owned by the Plan as of the Record Date constituted qualifying employer
securities as defined in section 407(d)(5) of Title I of the Act and, therefore, satisfied the requirements of section
407(a) of Title I of the Act.

4. Under the terms of the Rights offer (the Offering), each shareholder received 0.56 Rights for each share of Common
Stock held as of the close of business on Tuesday, February 9, 1993 (the Record Date). The Rights were treated as separate
securities under federal securities laws and were traded on the NASDAQ national market system separately from the
Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Offering, the Rights were exercisable until 5:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Monday,
March 15, 1993. Thereafter, any unexercised Rights expired and became worthless. Each Right conferred upon the registered
holder thereof the right (the Basic Privilege) to purchase one share of Common Stock at a stated exercise price of $4.75
per share (the Exercise Price). Each Right also carried with it the nontransferable right to subscribe, at the Exercise
Price, for the shares underlying any Rights that remained unexercised upon the expiration of the Offering on March
15, 1993, subject to proration (the Oversubscription Privilege).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only holders of Common Stock who exercised all their Rights pursuant to the Basic Privilege were entitled to subscribe
for shares pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If the oversubscription requests exceeded the number of available shares, the available shares were to be allocated
or ``prorated'' among the oversubscribers in proportion to the number of shares each purchased pursuant to the Basic
Privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 3,176,144 shares of the Common Stock were issued by BMJ pursuant to the Offering. Of this total, 2,444,565
shares were issued through the exercise of Rights, with 2,100,433 shares purchased through the Basic Privilege and
344,132 shares purchased through the Oversubscription Privilege. The remaining 731,579 shares of the total sold
pursuant to the Offering were sold pursuant to standby purchase agreements with eight standby purchasers. Executive
officers and members of the board of directors of BMJ purchased 207,883 shares of the Common Stock issued pursuant
to the Offering. Gross proceeds generated by BMJ from the Offering totalled $15,086,684, including $3,470,000 raised
through standby purchase agreements. All sales of Common Stock pursuant to the Offering were made at the Exercise
Price, $4.75 per share. On February 8, 1993, prior to the Record Date, the Common Stock closed on the NASDAQ system at
a price of $8.88 per share. The Plan received 68,343 Rights as a result of the Offering because the Plan had held 122,042
shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Fiduciary represents that it exercised due diligence to determine the most prudent response to the Offering
on behalf of the Plan, and that all information relevant to the Offering was analyzed, including the following: (a)
The terms of the Plan and its trust document; (b) the economic impact on the Plan under various alternatives, including
selling the Rights, exercising the Rights, taking no action and any combination of these alternatives; (c) the cash
balances available to the Plan, the Plan's expected cash flow and the Plan's ability to borrow cash; (d) the likely
value of the Oversubscription Privilege and the likelihood of any shares becoming available thereunder; and (e)
the procedures and methodology of the Offering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of its considerations of all options available to the Plan under the circumstances prevailing at the time
of the Offering, the Fiduciary represents that it determined that the most prudent course of action was for the Plan
to exercise the Basic Privilege with respect to all 68,343 Rights issued to the Plan. To do so, the Plan needed $324,629.25
in cash, which was $263,335.49 more than the Plan ultimately received in cash matching contributions before the close
of the Offering on March 15, 1993. In order to generate the additional cash needed to exercise the Rights, the Fiduciary
determined that the Plan should sell a portion of the Common Stock held by the Plan. In addition, the Fiduciary also
determined that the Plan should borrow $60,000, if possible, to acquire an additional 12,500 shares of Common Stock,
if such shares became available to the Plan pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege. Although the Plan had additional
shares of Common Stock it could sell to raise the cash necessary to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege, the Fiduciary
represents that it had determined that very few shares of additional Common Stock would become available pursuant
to the Oversubscription Privilege, and that the transaction costs involved in the Plan selling the additional shares
were not justified. The Fiduciary determined that a short-term loan, on the other hand, permitted the Plan to raise
the necessary cash at relatively modest cost.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fiduciary states that once it had made the foregoing determinations, it directed the Committee and the Trustee
to take the following steps: (1) Immediately sell 38,000 shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ system for $7.00 per share,
which was the net price per share prevailing on the NASDAQ on March 4, 1993, the day the instructions were received;
(2) Apply the sales proceeds and the cash matching contributions to exercise the Basic Privilege with respect to all
Rights issued to the Plan at a cost of $324,629.25; and (3) If possible, borrow $60,000 (the Loan) and apply the Loan
proceeds to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege for an additional 12,500 shares of Common Stock, subject to
the following conditions: (a) The Loan was not to be outstanding for more than 30 days; (b) To the extent some or all of
the 12,500 shares did not become available pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege, the remaining Loan proceeds
were to be applied to repay the unused portion of the Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Fiduciary's instructions, the Trustee and the Committee executed the sale of 38,000 shares of Common
Stock and purchased 68,343 shares of Common Stock at the Exercise Price by exercising the Basic Privilege on behalf
of the Plan. However, because an unrelated lender could not be located to make the Loan to the Plan, the Fiduciary directed
the Trustee and the Committee not to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The applicant represents that as a result of participating in the Offering as directed by the Fiduciary, the Plan
realized a net gain of $182,027.70. Prior to the Offering, the Plan held 122,042 shares of Common Stock and was scheduled
to receive cash matching contributions of $61,293.76 before the end of the Offering. The applicant explains that
the Plan's normal practice would have been to invest the cash matching contributions in Common Stock through a dividend
reinvestment program on the 10th day of the month following the date on which the contribution was received. If the
Plan had not participated in the Offering and instead had followed its normal practice, the Plan would have held 128,700
shares of Common Stock, plus $12,261.05 in cash, at the end of the Offering on March 15, 1993. BMJ states that these assets
would have had a fair market value on that date of $1,039,717.05. By participating in the Offering as directed by the
Fiduciary, the Plan instead held 153,385 shares of Common Stock, plus $2,664.51 in cash, at the end of the Offering
on March 15, 1993, resulting in total Plan assets with a fair market value of $1,221,744.75. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The applicant states that the issuance of the Rights to the Plan resulted from unilateral, independent actions
of BMJ, and that the Plan, as an owner of Common Stock, received the Rights on the same basis as all other Common Stock
owners. The applicant explains that the purpose of the Offering was to generate necessary capital for BMJ and that
the inevitable effect of issuing new shares of Common Stock was the dilution of the proportionate interest in the corporation
represented by all previously-issued shares. Accordingly, Common Stock owners who failed to exercise the Rights
could be expected to experience a diminution in their proportionate interest in BMJ and a decrease in the value of their
Common Stock shares. Common Stock owners who exercised their Rights could avoid such reductions of interest and value,
and could potentially experience a net gain. The applicant notes that the Fiduciary determined that the most prudent
course of action for the Plan with respect to the Offering was to participate by exercising the Rights to the maximum
extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In summary, the applicant represents that the transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for
the following reasons: (a) The Plan's receipt of the Rights through the Offering resulted from unilateral, independent
actions of BMJ with the sole intent of generating necessary additional capital; (b) The Plan received the Rights,
and was accorded treatment under the Offering, on the same basis as all other owners of Common Stock as of the Record
Date of the Offering; (c) The interests of the Plan with respect to the Rights and the Offering were represented independently
of BMJ, by the Fiduciary, who had sole responsibility with respect to the Plan's actions regarding the Rights; and
(d) The Fiduciary determined that the most prudent course of action on behalf of the Plan with respect to the Offering
was the exercise of the Rights to the maximum extent possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a defined benefit plan that has one participant, H. Stephen Cranston. As of March 31, 1993, the total assets
of the Plan were $748,627. The fiduciaries of the Plan, who have investment discretion over the assets of the Plan,
are H. Stephen Cranston and his wife, Karen Y. Cranston, who are also the applicants for the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sponsoring employer of the plan is a California professional corporation which is designated as H. Stephen Cranston
Professional Corporation. It is engaged in the practice of general business law with its offices in San Marino, California.
H. Stephen Cranston is the sole shareholder and only employee.

2. The Property consists of 59.9 acres of forested land that is located in Linn County on 48063 Cascadia Drive, Cascadia,
Oregon. The improvements on the Property are a 67 year old two-story house with a detached barn and shed. The house is
represented by the applicants to be in a deplorable condition and uninhabitable. There is no available drinking water,
the prior occupants destroyed the furnace for heating the house, and the septic tank needs to be replaced. There is
no basement under the house and the wood foundation, which is riddled with termites and dry rot, is braced to avoid collapsing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Property was appraised by Scott Lepman, SRA, RM of Albany, Oregon, an independent appraiser, who determined,
as of March 18, 1994, that the Property had a fair market value of $128,000. Among other things, Mr. Lepman determined
that the Property would not qualify for bank financing; and also, he observed many structural defects on the Property:
the buildings need painting; the sunporch needs to be finished; the ceiling in the living room is in disrepair; the
walls in several rooms need repairing; and the house's foundation is structurally unsound. He also observed functional
obsolence such as, the house has unevenly settled and has no conventional source for heating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Lepman also indicated that the barn and shed are in disrepair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Lepman described the location of the Property, which is surrounded by forest land, to be in a mixed neighborhood
of poor to good dwellings that vary in age and design, and are predominately located on large parcels that are devoted
to agricultural and timber production. Mr. Lepman referred to the properties in the area as below average in visual
appeal and in level of maintenance. He further stated that the area is an older rural community with a declining timber
base due to the enforced governmental protections of the spotted owl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Property was purchased by the Plan on July 30, 1990, from Charlie West and Lorraine West, husband and wife, for
the total consideration of $70,000. The Wests are represented by the applicants as unrelated persons with respect
to the Plan and its sole participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicants represent that the purchase of the Property was made by the Plan with the intention that the timber on
the Property would be cut and sold over a number of years for a profitable return to the Plan. During 1992, the Plan had
cut approximately 40 percent of the timber on the Property for a net return of $43,646.32 after expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the cutting in 1992, the applicants represent that circumstances have curtailed further timber cutting. One
intervening condition has been the recent reporting of spotted owls in the area followed by the imposition of governmental
regulations precluding the cutting of timber and destroying the owl's habitat. Another curtailment to cutting timber
on the Property is the State of Oregon requirements that all trees cut must be replaced with new trees that survive for
at least five years. The applicants represent that because of the steep and uneven contours of the Property the survival
of new trees is precarious and uncertain. Also, after the replanting there is a need for the services of a professional
forester to care for the new plantings for an additional three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Plan purchased the Property in 1990 for $70,000 and incurred legal fees of $262.35, the applicants represent
that the Plan has expended an additional sum of $15,794.38 for repairs and maintenance of the Property. The expenses
to the Plan included such things as property taxes, roof repairs, weed and rubbish removal, electrical repairs, fence
and gate repairs, chimney removal, materials and labor for bracing the foundation of house, and security services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The applicants propose that the Property be sold to them for the higher of either its fair market value or for the total
amount of funds expended by the Plan acquiring and maintaining the Property, so that the Plan can avoid the continuing
expenses of repairing, reforesting, and maintaining the Property. In addition, the Plan will be able to invest the
funds from the Sale in liquid assets that generate yields and incur less expenses. The applicants state that the Plan
will incur no expenses nor any losses from the proposed transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicants represent that the proposed transaction will be in the best interests of the Plan and its participant
and beneficiaries because it is unlikely that the Property can be sold to persons unrelated to the Plan. The applicants
represent, and the appraiser corroborates, that the Property is not habitable and the availability of bank financing
for the purchase of the Property is not foreseeable. Also, the likelihood of finding a purchaser in the area with adequate
cash is represented to be remote because of the high unemployment in the area due to logging restrictions involving
the ecological problem of the spotted owl.

The applicants who are the only persons affected by the proposed transaction desire that the proposed transaction

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transaction will satisfy the criteria of section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code because (a) the Sale of the Property involves a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the Plan will not incur
any expenses from the Sale; (c) the Plan will receive as consideration from the Sale the greater of either the fair market
value of the Property as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser on the date of the Sale, or an amount equal
to all the funds expended by the Plan in acquiring and maintaining the Property during its period of ownership; (d)
the Sale will permit the Plan to reinvest illiquid assets into income producing, liquid assets; and (e) the Plan will
avoid the expenses and risks involved in maintaining and developing the Property.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (S&amp;P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. (D&amp;P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation
D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates
has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire
certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not
satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of such certificates, provided that (1) such condition
is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum; and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates,
the trustee obtains a representation from each initial purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such
condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser
(or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates) is required to obtain from its transferee a representation
regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, any such transferees will be required to make a written representation
regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection II.A.(6) above.

The Department notes that PTE 83&hyph;1 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983], a class exemption for mortgage pool investment
trusts, would generally apply to trusts containing single-family residential mortgages, provided that the applicable
conditions of PTE 83&hyph;1 are met. The Applicants request relief for single-family residential mortgages in this
exemption because it would prefer one exemption for all trusts of similar structure. However, the Applicants have
stated that they may still avail themselves of the exemptive relief provided by PTE 83&hyph;1.

Guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates are mortgage-backed securities with respect to which interest
and principal payable is guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). The Department's regulation
relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(i)) provides that where a plan acquires a guaranteed
governmental mortgage pool certificate, the plan's assets include the certificate and all of its rights with respect
to such certificate under applicable law, but do not, solely by reason of the plan's holding of such certificate, include
any of the mortgages underlying such certificate. The Applicants are requesting exemptive relief for trusts containing
guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates because the certificates in the trusts may be plan assets.

3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases of real property. Commercial mortgages
are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation
of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the
pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided
by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages
will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages.

Trust Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The
sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have
been originated by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor or servicer, or by an unrelated lender
and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes
the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal
title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust
assets. The certificates are either publicly or privately offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificateholders are entitled to receive monthly or quarterly installments of principal and/or interest, or
lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the pass-through
rate_which may be fixed or variable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A segregated account is established in the name of the trustee or the servicer (in either case, on behalf of certificateholders)
to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account is under the sole control of the trustee or the servicer,
as applicable, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received a rating comparable
to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make a single deposit into
the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from obligors by the servicer
may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. In no event will the period of time between
receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account exceed 45 days.

5. Some of the certificates will be multi-class certificates. The Applicants request exemptive relief for two types
of multi-class certificates: ``strip'' certificates and ``fast-pay/ slow-pay'' certificates. Strip certificates
are a type of security in which the stream of interest payments on receivables is split from the flow of principal payments
and separate classes of certificates are established, each representing rights to disproportionate payments of
principal and interest.

It is the Department's understanding that where a plan invests in REMIC ``residual'' interest certificates to which
this exemption applies, some of the income received by the plan as a result of such investment may be considered unrelated
business taxable income to the plan, which is subject to income tax under the Code. The Department emphasizes that
the prudence requirement of section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act would require plan fiduciaries to carefully consider
this and other tax consequences prior to causing plan assets to be invested in certificates pursuant to this exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates involve the issuance of classes of certificates having different stated maturities
or the same maturities with different payment schedules. In certain transactions of this type, interest and/or principal
payments received on the underlying receivables are distributed first to the class of certificates having the earliest
stated maturity of principal, and/or earlier payment schedule, and only when that class of certificates has been
paid in full (or has received a specified amount) will distributions be made with respect to the second class of certificates.
Distributions on certificates having later stated maturities will proceed in like manner until all the certificateholders
have been paid in full. The only difference between this multi-class pass-through arrangement and a single-class
pass-through arrangement is the order in which distributions are made to certificateholders. In each case, certificateholders
will have a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying assets. In neither case will the rights of a plan purchasing
a certificate be subordinated to the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on any of the underlying
obligations. In particular, if the amount available for distribution to certificateholders is less than the amount
required to be so distributed, all senior certificateholders then entitled to receive distributions will share
in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis.

If a trust issues subordinated certificates, holders of such subordinated certificates may not share in the amount
distributed on a pro rata basis with the senior certificateholders. The Department notes that the exemption does
not provide relief for plan investment in such subordinated certificates.

6. For tax reasons, the trust must be maintained as an essentially passive entity. Therefore, both the sponsor's discretion
and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited. Pooling and servicing
agreements provide for the substitution of receivables by the sponsor only in the event of defects in documentation
discovered within a short time after the issuance of trust certificates. Any receivable so substituted is required
to have characteristics substantially similar to the replaced receivable and will be at least as creditworthy as
the replaced receivable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected
receivable and passed through to certificateholders.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
originator 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a homeowner or automobile
purchaser, or leases property to the lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell
it to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course
of their business, including finance companies for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations,
financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind
of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations.
Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of the receivables may also function as the
trust sponsor or servicer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sponsor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will be GECMSI. Where the sponsor is not also the servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring
the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables
to the trust.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
trustee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents
and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in
favor of certificateholders.

The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to the trust sponsor, the servicer or underwriter
or placement agent. The Applicants represent that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust
company experienced in trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the servicer,
sponsor or out of trust assets. The method of compensating the trustee will be specified in the pooling and servicing
agreement and disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates.

of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically
involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments
received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where
a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common
for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service''
the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted,
a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's
perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments
from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though
they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to the underwriter or the placement agent. In other cases, however,
GECMSI may originate or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor a trust for which Capital Markets will
be the underwriter or placement agent.

Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Where the sponsor of a trust is not the originator of receivables included in a trust, the sponsor generally purchases
the receivables in the secondary market, either directly from the originator or from another secondary market participant.
The price the sponsor pays for a receivable is determined by competitive market forces, taking into account payment
terms, interest rate, quality, and forecasts as to future interest rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives certificates representing the
entire beneficial interest in the trust, or the cash proceeds of the sale of such certificates. If the sponsor receives
certificates from the trust, the sponsor sells all or a portion of these certificates for cash to investors or securities
underwriters. In some transactions, the sponsor or an affiliate may retain a portion of the certificates for its own
account. In addition, in some transactions the originator may sell receivables to a trust for cash. At the time of the
sale, the trustee would sell certificates to the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the sale to pay
the originator for receivables sold to the trust. The transfer of the receivables to the trust by the sponsor, the sale
of certificates to investors, and the receipt of the cash proceeds by the sponsor generally take place simultaneously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces,
including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on
investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying
receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified
servicing fee.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of
a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon, rate together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases
a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased
at a premium yields less than the stated coupon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The pass-through rate on certificates representing interests in trusts holding leases is determined by breaking
down lease payments into ``principal'' and ``interest'' components based on an implicit interest rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor, and receive fees
for acting in that capacity) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables in the trust
and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion of the
payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support or deposited into
a reserve fund. The servicer may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables
between the time they are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the
pooling and servicing agreement). The servicer will be required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing
the trust, including, in some cases, the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange
to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees,
and is either paid out of the interest income received on the receivables in excess of the pass-through rate or paid
in a lump sum at the time the trust is established.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. The servicer may be entitled to retain certain administrative fees paid by a third party, usually the obligor.
These administrative fees fall into three categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) prepayment fees; (b) late payment and payment extension fees and fees related to the modification of the terms
of an obligation as permitted by the provisions of the pooling and servicing agreement (including the partial release
of collateral to the extent provided therein); and (c) fees and charges associated with foreclosure or repossession,
or other conversion of a secured position into cash proceeds, upon default of an obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compensation payable to the servicer will be set forth or referred to in the pooling and servicing agreement and described
in reasonable detail in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Payments on receivables may be made by obligors to the servicer at various times during the period preceding any
date on which pass-through payments to the trust are due. In some cases, the pooling and servicing agreement may permit
the servicer to place these payments in non-interest bearing accounts in itself or to commingle such payments with
its own funds prior to the distribution dates. In these cases, the servicer would be entitled to the benefit derived
from the use of the funds between the date of payment on a receivable and the pass-through date. Commingled payments
may not be protected from the creditors of the servicer in the event of the servicer's bankruptcy or receivership.
In those instances when payments on receivables are held in non-interest bearing accounts or are commingled with
the servicer's own funds, the servicer is required to deposit these payments by a date specified in the pooling and
servicing agreement into an account from which the trustee makes payments to certificateholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Underwriters or placement agents will receive a fee in connection with the securities underwriting or private
placement of certificates. In a firm commitment underwriting, this fee would consist of the difference between what
such underwriter receives for the certificates that it distributes and what it pays the sponsor for those certificates.
In some public offerings, however, an underwriter may sell certificates on an agency basis in a best efforts underwriting.
In those cases, the underwriter would receive an agency commission paid by the sponsor plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket
expenses. In a private placement, the fee normally takes the form of an agency commission paid by the sponsor.

Purchase of Receivables by the Servicer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17. The Applicants represent that as the principal amount of the receivables in a trust is reduced by payment, the cost
of administering the trust generally increases, making the servicing of the trust prohibitively expensive at some
point. Consequently, the pooling and servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchase the
receivables remaining in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balance payable on the receivables is reduced to a specified
percentage (usually 5 to 10 percent) of the initial aggregate unpaid balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purchase price of a receivable is specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and will be at least equal to:
(1) the unpaid principal balance on the receivable plus accrued interest, less any unreimbursed advances of principal
made by the servicer; or (2) the greater of (a) the amount in (1) or (b) the fair market value of such obligations in the
case of a REMIC, or the fair market value of the certificates in the case of a trust that is not a REMIC.

Certificate Ratings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. The certificates will have received one of the three highest ratings available from either S&amp;P's, Moody's,
D&amp;P or Fitch. Insurance or other credit support will be obtained by the trust sponsor to the extent necessary for
the certificates to attain the desired rating. The amount of this credit support is set by the rating agencies at a level
that is a multiple of the worst historical net credit loss experience for the type of obligations included in the issuing
trust.

Provision of Credit Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. In some cases, the master servicer, or an affiliate of the master servicer, may provide credit support to the trust
(i.e. act as an insurer). In these cases, the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance funds
to the full extent that it determines that such advances will be recoverable (a) out of late payments by the obligors,
(b) from the credit support provider (which may be itself) or, (c) in the case of a trust that issues subordinated certificates,
from amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinated certificates, and the master servicer will advance
such funds in a timely manner. When the servicer is the provider of the credit support and provides its own funds to cover
defaulted payments, it will do so either on the initiative of the trustee, or on its own initiative on behalf of the trustee,
but in either event it will provide such funds to cover payments to the full extent of its obligations under the credit
support mechanism. In some cases, however, the master servicer may not be obligated to advance funds but instead would
be called upon to provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of its obligations as insurer. However,
a master servicer typically can recover advances either from the provider of credit support or from future payments
on the affected assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the master servicer fails to advance funds, fails to call upon the credit support mechanism to provide funds to cover
delinquent payments, or otherwise fails in its duties, the trustee would be required and would be able to enforce the
certificateholders' rights, as both a party to the pooling and servicing agreement and the owner of the trust estate,
including rights under the credit support mechanism. Therefore, the trustee, who is independent of the servicer,
will have the ultimate right to enforce the credit support arrangement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a master servicer advances funds, the amount so advanced is recoverable by the servicer out of future payments
on receivables held by the trust to the extent not covered by credit support. However, where the master servicer provides
credit support to the trust, there are protections in place to guard against a delay in calling upon the credit support
to take advantage of the fact that the credit support declines proportionally with the decrease in the principal amount
of the obligations in the trust as payments on receivables are passed through to investors. These safeguards include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) There is often a disincentive to postponing credit losses because the sooner repossession or foreclosure activities
are commenced, the more value that can be realized on the security for the obligation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The master servicer has servicing guidelines which include a general policy as to the allowable delinquency period
after which an obligation ordinarily will be deemed uncollectible. The pooling and servicing agreement will require
the master servicer to follow its normal servicing guidelines and will set forth the master servicer's general policy
as to the period of time after which delinquent obligations ordinarily will be considered uncollectible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As frequently as payments are due on the receivables included in the trust (usually monthly or quarterly as set
forth in the pooling and servicing agreement), the master servicer is required to report to the independent trustee
the amount of all past-due payments and the amount of all servicer advances, along with other current information
as to collections on the receivables and draws upon the credit support. Further, the master servicer is required to
deliver to the trustee annually a certificate of an executive officer of the master servicer stating that a review
of the servicing activities has been made under such officer's supervision, and either stating that the master servicer
has fulfilled all of its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement or, if the master servicer has defaulted
under any of its obligations, specifying any such default. The master servicer's reports are reviewed at least annually
by independent accountants to ensure that the master servicer is following its normal servicing standards and that
the master servicer's reports conform to the master servicer's internal accounting records. The results of the independent
accountants' review are delivered to the trustee; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Credit support will be provided based upon a specified percentage of the aggregate initial principal balance
of the receivables included in the trust. The credit support is a fixed dollar amount, subject to reduction only for
actual draws thereon, throughout the life of the trust. As a result (subject to draws thereon), the amount of this credit
support will increase as a percentage of the pool principal during the life of the trust. The Applicants represent
that this approach thereby provides investors with greater protection than the approach which permits proportionate
reductions in the credit support, subject to a floor which only is effective towards the end of the life of the trust.

21. Reports indicating the amount of payments of principal and interest are provided to certificateholders at least
as frequently as distributions are made to certificateholders. Certificateholders will also be provided with periodic
information statements setting forth material information concerning the underlying assets, including, where
applicable, information as to the amount and number of delinquent and defaulted loans or receivables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. In the case of a trust that offers and sells certificates in a registered public offering, the trustee, the servicer
or the sponsor will file such periodic reports as may be required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Although some trusts that offer certificates in a public offering will file quarterly reports on Form 10&hyph;Q and
Annual Reports on Form 10&hyph;K, many trusts obtain, by application to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
a complete exemption from the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10&hyph;Q and a modification of the disclosure
requirements for annual reports on Form 10&hyph;K. If such an exemption is obtained, these trusts normally would
continue to have the obligation to file current reports on Form 8&hyph;K to report material developments concerning
the trust and the certificates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of the periodic reporting
requirements is subject to change, periodic reports concerning a trust will be filed to the extent required under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. At or about the time distributions are made to certificateholders, a report will be delivered to the trustee as
to the status of the trust and its assets, including underlying obligations. Such report will typically contain information
regarding the trust's assets, payments received or collected by the servicer, the amount of prepayments, delinquencies,
servicer advances, defaults and foreclosures, the amount of any payments made pursuant to any credit support, and
the amount of compensation payable to the servicer. Such report also will be delivered to or made available to the rating
agency or agencies that have rated the trust's certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, promptly after each distribution date, certificateholders will receive a statement prepared by the
trustee summarizing information regarding the trust and its assets. Such statement will include information regarding
the trust and its assets, including underlying receivables. Such statement will typically contain information
regarding payments and prepayments, delinquencies, the remaining amount of the guaranty or other credit support
and a breakdown of payments between principal and interest.

24. It is the policy of many underwriters to attempt to make a market for securities for which it is lead or co-managing
underwriter. It is also the policy of many placement agents to facilitate sales by investors who purchase certificates
if such entity has acted as agent or principal in the original private placement of the certificates and if such investors
request such entity's assistance.

Retroactive Relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. The Applicants represent that they have engaged in transactions related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities based on the assumption that retroactive relief would not be granted. However, it is possible that some
transactions may have occurred that would be prohibited. For example, because many certificates are held in street
or nominee name, it is not always possible to identify whether the percentage interest of plans in a trust is or is not
``significant'' for purposes of the Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(f)).
These problems are compounded as transactions occur in the secondary market. In addition, with respect to the ``publicly-offered
security'' exception contained in that regulation (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(b)), it is difficult to determine whether
each purchaser of a certificate is independent of all other purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Applicants request relief retroactive for transactions which have occurred on or after June 28, 1994,
the date the Applicants originally filed their exemption application with the Department.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. In summary, the Applicants represent that the transactions for which exemptive relief is requested satisfy the
statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act due to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The trusts contain ``fixed pools'' of assets. There is little discretion on the part of the trust sponsor to substitute
receivables contained in the trust once the trust has been formed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Certificates in which plans invest will have been rated in one of the three highest rating categories by S&amp;P's,
Moody's, D&amp;P or Fitch. Credit support will be obtained to the extent necessary to attain the desired rating; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All transactions for which the Applicants seek exemptive relief will be governed by the pooling and servicing
agreement, which is made available to plan fiduciaries for their review prior to the plan's investment in certificates;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Exemptive relief from sections 406(b) and 407 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sales to plans is substantially limited; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Many underwriters have made, and the Applicants anticipate that such underwriters will continue to make, a secondary
market in the publicly-offered certificates sponsored by GECMSI.

PTE 83&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exemptive relief proposed herein is similar to that provided in PTE 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
81&hyph;7 [46 FR 7520, January 23, 1981], Class Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Mortgage Pool Investment
Trusts, amended and restated as PTE 83&hyph;1 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PTE 83&hyph;1 applies to mortgage pool investment trusts consisting of interest-bearing obligations secured by
first or second mortgages or deeds of trust on single-family residential property. The exemption provides relief
from sections 406(a) and 407 for the sale, exchange or transfer in the initial issuance of mortgage pool certificates
between the trust sponsor and a plan, when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a party-in-interest with
respect to the plan, and the continued holding of such certificates, provided that the conditions set forth in the
exemption are met. PTE 83&hyph;1 also provides exemptive relief from section 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act for the
above-described transactions when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a fiduciary with respect to the
plan assets invested in such certificates, provided that additional conditions set forth in the exemption are met.
In particular, section 406(b) relief is conditioned upon the approval of the transaction by an independent fiduciary.
Moreover, the total value of certificates purchased by a plan must not exceed 25 percent of the amount of the issue,
and at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount of the issue must be acquired by persons independent of the trust sponsor,
trustee or insurer. Finally, PTE 83&hyph;1 provides conditional exemptive relief from section 406 (a) and (b) of
the Act for transactions in connection with the servicing and operation of the mortgage trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under PTE 83&hyph;1, exemptive relief for the above transactions is conditioned upon the sponsor and the trustee
of the mortgage trust maintaining a system for insuring or otherwise protecting the pooled mortgage loans and the
property securing such loans, and for indemnifying certificateholders against reductions in pass-through payments
due to defaults in loan payments or property damage. This system must provide such protection and indemnification
up to an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of all trust mortgages or
the principal balance of the largest mortgage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemptive relief proposed herein differs from that provided by PTE 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
83&hyph;1 in the following major respects: (1) The proposed exemption provides individual exemptive relief rather
than class relief; (2) The proposed exemption covers transactions involving trusts containing a broader range of
assets than single-family residential mortgages; (3) Instead of requiring a system for insuring the pooled receivables,
the proposed exemption conditions relief upon the certificates having received one of the three highest ratings
available from S&amp;P's, Moody's, D&amp;P or Fitch (insurance or other credit support would be obtained only to
the extent necessary for the certificates to attain the desired rating); and (4) The proposed exemption provides
more limited section 406(b) and section 407 relief for sales transactions.

After consideration of the representations of the Applicants and information provided by S&amp;P's, Moody's, D&amp;P

in one of the three highest generic rating categories from S&amp;P's, Moody's, D&amp;P or Fitch. The Department believes
that the rating condition will permit the Applicants flexibility in structuring trusts containing a variety of mortgages
and other receivables while ensuring that the interests of plans investing in certificates are protected. The Department
also believes that the ratings are indicative of the relative safety of investments in trusts containing secured
receivables. The Department is conditioning the proposed exemptive relief upon each particular type of asset-backed
security having been rated in one of the three highest rating categories for at least one year and having been sold to
investors other than plans for at least one year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In referring to different ``types'' of asset-backed securities, the Department means certificates representing
interests in trusts containing different ``types'' of receivables, such as single family residential mortgages,
multi-family residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, home equity loans, auto loan receivables, installment
obligations for consumer durables secured by purchase money security interests, etc. The Department intends this
condition to require that certificates in which a plan invests are of the type that have been rated (in one of the three
highest generic rating categories by S&amp;P's, D&amp;P, Fitch or Moody's) and purchased by investors other than
plans for at least one year prior to the plan's investment pursuant to the proposed exemption. In this regard, the Department
does not intend to require that the particular assets contained in a trust must have been ``seasoned'' (e.g., originated
at least one year prior to the plan's investment in the trust).

III. Limited Section 406(b) and Section 407(a) Relief for Sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicants represent that in some cases a trust sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, and obligor with respect
to receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates may be a pre-existing party in interest with
respect to an investing plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In these cases, a direct or indirect sale of certificates by that party in interest to the plan would be a prohibited
sale or exchange of property under section 406(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Likewise, issues are raised under section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act where a plan fiduciary causes a plan to purchase
certificates where trust funds will be used to benefit a party in interest.

In this regard, we note that the exemptive relief proposed herein is limited to certificates with respect to which
the Applicants or any of their affiliates are either (a) the sole underwriter or manager or co-manager of the underwriting
syndicate, (b) a selling or placement agent, or (c) the sponsor, in which case an entity which has received from the
Department an individual prohibited transaction exemption relating to certificates which is similar to this exemption
is the sole underwriter or the manager or co-manager of the underwriting syndicate, or a selling or placement agent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicants represent that where a trust sponsor is one of the Applicants or its affiliate, sales to plans by the
sponsor may be exempt under PTE 75&hyph;1, Part II (relating to purchases and sales of securities by broker-dealers
and their affiliates), if none of the Applicants is a fiduciary with respect to plan assets to be invested in certificates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, the Applicants represent that a trust sponsor, servicer, trustee, insurer, and obligor with respect
to receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter of certificates representing an interest in a trust may be a
fiduciary with respect to an investing plan. The Applicants represent that the exercise of fiduciary authority by
any of these parties to cause the plan to invest in certificates representing an interest in the trust would violate
section 406(b)(1), and in some cases section 406(b)(2), of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Applicants represent that to the extent there is a plan asset ``look through'' to the underlying assets
of a trust, the investment in certificates by a plan covering employees of an obligor under receivables contained
in a trust may be prohibited by sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the issues involved, the Department has determined to provide the limited sections 406(b)
and 407(a) relief as specified in the proposed exemption.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->
Georgia Power Company, et al; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;68 and NPF&hyph;81 issued to Georgia Power Company, Ogelthorpe Power Corporation Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee) for operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating
Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Burke County, Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will relocate the requirements of Technical Specification 3/4.7.10, Area Temperature Monitoring,
to section 16.3 of the VEGP Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). With this relocation to the FSAR, GPC plans to clarify
the basis for areas to be monitored and modify these surveillance requirements. This change is being proposed in accordance
with NUREG&hyph;1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of area temperature monitoring is to provide reasonable assurance that the normal operating temperatures
in the selected rooms will remain consistent with the temperatures assumed for the environmental qualification
of safety related equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The normal operating temperature is significant for its effect on the qualified life of the components as well as the
predicted environmental transients (i.e., pressure, temperature, and radiation) that occur under accident conditions.
The following justifications are provided for the proposed changes to the area temperature monitoring program:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change to perform temperature surveillance only when the normal ventilation system is out of service
is justified based on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The HVAC systems at VEGP have been designed to maintain the room temperatures at less than the maximum normal temperature
specified for environmental qualification purposes. The HVAC calculations have conservatively considered the
worst case heat load conditions with a nominal safety factor when sizing the cooling systems that serve the subject
rooms. As a result, the plant is generally maintained at temperatures well below the level assumed for normal operation
and used for environmental qualification of equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Temperature monitoring activities per Technical Specification 3/4.7.10 have been in place for 6 years on Unit
1 and 4 years on Unit 2. The data collected during this time demonstrate that the temperatures have remained well within
environmental qualification limits with the exception of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) area which has exceeded
its reportability limits on several occasions. The MSIV area has since been provided with a new ventilation system
and temperature monitoring instrumentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the normal ventilation system for one of the specified rooms is not functioning, temperature monitoring activities
will resume at the previously specified rate of once every 12 hours. The proposed change to monitor these rooms only
when the normal ventilation system is out of service will provide a level of assurance that is similar to that provided
by the current Technical Specification. Therefore, continued monitoring is not warranted as long as the normal ventilation
systems are functioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change in room selection criteria to eliminate rooms that are classified as mild environment is justified
based on the current methods of environmental qualification. The qualified life of safety related equipment in mild
environment is no longer based on environmental qualification, but is based on a combination of design life, trending,
and periodic maintenance and surveillance as discussed in FSAR section 3.11.B. Therefore, the monitoring of mild
rooms is not required to verify that the normal design temperature is being maintained. However, the existing Technical
Specifications not only require monitoring of the normal room temperature, but also require actions to evaluate
equipment operability if an abnormal condition temperature limit is exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address this abnormal temperature condition, the rooms that are not monitored based on mild environment will not
exceed 150
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F following a complete loss of normal HVAC for a 7-day period.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The abnormal temperature limits currently shown in the Technical Specifications are the calculated room temperatures
with a loss of normal HVAC for a 24-hour period. The new criterion is based on an equipment qualification analysis that
demonstrates that short duration temperature excursions of up to 24 hours at 150
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F have an insignificant effect on the qualified life of electrical and mechanical equipment. The limitation
is further supported by Appendix F of NUMARC Report 87&hyph;00 that concludes that electrical and mechanical equipment
will operate in station blackout conditions with no loss of function with temperatures of up to 150
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for short durations (i.e., 4 hours).

Per project calculations, the loss of normal HVAC for 7 days has been shown to be sufficient time to achieve steady state
temperature conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Relocation of area temperature monitoring to the FSAR and the revision of the TS reporting requirements are justified
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. As discussed in enclosure 1 [of the licensee's February 3, 1994 submittal], the existing TS requirements for the
area temperature monitoring program do not meet any of the criteria of the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specification
Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and can safely be relocated to the FSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The area temperature monitoring program added to the FSAR will continue to ensure that room temperatures are maintained
within the limits assumed for environmental qualification. The monitoring requirements of once every 12 hours when
the normal ventilation system is not in service will ensure that a room would not experience a short duration temperature
excursion for more than 24 hours without an evaluation of equipment operability. Although reporting requirements
have been excluded from the FSAR description, an evaluation of equipment operability will continue to be performed
in the event that the temperature limits are exceeded. The reporting of operability concerns to the NRC will be based
on the reporting requirements for the specific equipment in an affected area after a determination of operability
has been made. The current TS requires that a report be prepared and submitted to the NRC that demonstrates the continued
operability of the affected equipment if the maximum normal temperature in an area is exceeded for more than 8 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new FSAR description will continue to require an evaluation of equipment operability if either the normal temperature
limit or abnormal condition temperature limit is exceeded. However, no report to the NRC will be required unless the
equipment operability evaluation indicates a reportable condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above considerations, GPC has concluded the following concerning 10 CFR 50.92.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The environmental qualification and operability of the safety
related equipment will not be adversely affected by the proposed changes to the area temperature monitoring program.
The relocation of TS to the FSAR and the changes to monitoring frequency will not increase the probability that the
room temperature design limits will be exceeded or result in a loss of qualified life of safety related equipment.
In addition, the consequences of exceeding the temperature limits will not significantly differ from the existing
program since an evaluation of qualified life and operability will continue to be performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from any accident previously evaluated. The relocation of area temperature monitoring to the FSAR and the
changes in monitoring procedures do not change the design of individual equipment, systems, nor the plant operating
procedures and therefore will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those already
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change to the Technical Specifications does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety
because the revised monitoring requirements will continue to ensure that the environmental qualification temperature
limits of safety related equipment scoped in the area temperature monitoring program will not be exceeded without
an evaluation of equipment operability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day period. However, should
circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in
derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By October 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Burke County Public Library, 412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro,
Georgia 30830. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Herbert N. Berkow: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Arthur H. Domby, Troutman Sanders, Nations Bank Plaza, 600 Peachtree Street, NE., Atlanta,
Georgia 30308, attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>University of Washington Research Reactor Notice of Proposed Issuance of Orders Authorizing Disposition of Component
Parts and Terminating Facility License</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of Orders authorizing the University
of Washington (the licensee) to dismantle the reactor facility and dispose of the component parts, and termination
of Facility License No. R&hyph;73, in accordance with the licensee's application dated August 2, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these Orders would be issued following the Commission's review and approval of the licensee's detailed
plan for decontamination of the facility and disposal of the radioactive components, or some alternate disposition
plan for the facility. This Order would authorize implementation of the approved plan. Following completion of the
authorized activities and verification by the Commission that acceptable radioactive contamination levels have
been achieved, the Commission would issue a second Order terminating the facility license and any further NRC jurisdiction
over the facility. Prior to issuance of each Order, the Commission will have made the findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By October 3, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the subject Orders and any
person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding
must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall
be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part
2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contention set forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions
shall be limited to matters within the scope of the action under consideration. A petitioner who fails to file such
a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at lest one contention will not be permitted to participate
as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, D.C. by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner or
representative for the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union
at 1&hyph;(800)&hyph;325&hyph;6000 (in Missouri 1&hyph;(800)&hyph;342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator
should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the following message addressed to Seymour H. Weiss: petitioner's
name and telephone number; date petition was mailed; the University of Washington; and publication date and page
number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, D.C. 20555, and to Ms. Christine Hughes, Division Chief and Special Assistant to the Attorney General,
University of Washington, 101 Administration, MS: AF&hyph;50, Seattle, Washington 98195, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing board, that the petitioner and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of
the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S.C., chapter 35), the notice announces a request
for reinstatement of an expired clearance for an information collection. Form RI 38&hyph;31, We Need More Information
About Your Missing Payment, is sent out by the Retirement and Insurance Group in response to a notification by an individual
of the loss or non-receipt of a payment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The form requests information
needed to enable OPM to trace and/or reissue payment. The information needed to replace a payment must be collected
either verbally or in writing. This collection is still necessary in order for OPM to be able to obtain replacement
payments as needed. This clearance was allowed to expire due to administrative error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately 10,000 RI 38&hyph;31 forms are processed annually. Of these, approximately 9,800 are reports of missing
checks. A response time for ten minutes per form reporting a missing check is estimated based on the amount of information
required. The annual burden is 1,634 hours. The remainder, 200, are claims for missing electronic transfer payments.
A response time of 30 minutes per form is estimated in these instances. The annual burden is 100 hours. The combined
annual burden is 1,734 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed change concerning its After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') facility (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15).
As originally filed, the proposed rule change requested permanent approval of Amex's pilot After-Hours Trading
facility and approval on a pilot basis for specialists in investment trust securities based on stock indexes to participate
in the AHT Facility. On January 4, 1994, the Amex amended the filing to request a three-month extension of the pilot
until April 30, 1994, which the Commission approved.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 On May 2, 1994, the Commission granted permanent approval to that portion of File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15
concerning the Amex's After-Hours Trading facility, not including the specialist participation request.

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is amending Rules 1300 (``Applicability of 1300 Series'') and 1302 (``After-Hours Trading Orders'')
for a one year pilot period to permit specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities listed pursuant to Section
118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 to participate in the AHT facility to ``clean-up'' order imbalances in the AHT facility by entering an order for the
specialist's account. For example, if there were single sided orders to buy 10,000 and sell 20,000 SPDRs immediately
prior to the 5:00 p.m. close of the AHT facility, the specialist would be permitted under the Exchange's proposed rule
amendments to enter an order for its account to buy up to 10,000 SPDRs in order to eliminate the sell side order imbalance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange currently lists one Portfolio Depositary Receipt, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
viz.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs''); and two investment trust securities pursuant to Section
118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines: LOR Index Trust SuperUnits and LOR Money Market SuperUnits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is also amending Rule 1302(b) to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust
securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility. Currently, Amex Rule 1302(b) provides that
a regular way good 'til cancelled order that is designated as After-Hours eligible, that is on the specialist's limit
order book, and that is executable at the closing price or better, shall migrate from the specialist's limit order
book to the AHT program. Any order for an account in which the specialist member organization or any associated party
has a direct or indirect interest is prohibited from migrating to the AHT program. The rule is being amended to provide
that any order for a Portfolio Depositary Receipt or an investment trust security listed on the Exchange pursuant
to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Standards, Policies and Requirements will not be permitted to migrate to
the AHT program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is also amending Rule 1302 to permit specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate
in a coupled closing price order so long as the other side of the order is not for an account in which a member or member
organization has a direct or indirect interest.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 For example, under the Exchange's amendment, the specialist in SPDRs would be permitted to agree prior to the 4:15
close of the regular trading session for such securities to take the other side of a customer order to buy or sell SPDRs
for execution in the AHT facility as a closing price coupled order. The Exchange believes that such a capability would
conform the trading of PDRs and investment trust securities to the practices of the ``basket'' market for equities
where it is customary for a dealer to agree prior to the close of the regular trading session to take the contra side of
a customer basket order and the closing index value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended, Amex Rule 1300 (e)(i) defines ``closing price'' as the price established by the last regular way sale on
the Exchange prior to the official closing of the 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. trading session, as determined by the Exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in the
AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing price coupled orders would benefit investors
by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative securities based upon well known market
indexes, such as those described above. The market price of these securities is based upon transactions largely effected
in markets other than the Amex. The Exchange states that the specialist in such securities has no unique access to market
sensitive information regarding the market for the underlying securities or closing index values. The Exchange,
therefore, believes that specialist participation in the AHT facility in PDRs and investment trust securities in
the manner described above does not raise any market integrity issues. In addition, should a customer not care for
an execution at the closing price, the rules of the Exchange's AHT facility permit cancellation of an order up to the
close of the AHT session at 5:00 p.m. (orders in the AHT facility are not executed until the 5:00 p.m. close of the after-hours
session.) A customer, therefore, will have approximately 40 minutes to determine if an execution at the closing price
suits its needs, and may cancel its order if it believes that the closing price does not suit its objectives.

III. Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with Sections 6(b)(5)
and 11 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of
an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. The Commission also believes
that the proposal is consistent with Section 11(b) of the Act and Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 which allow exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists in order to maintain fair and orderly markets.

Both the Act and Exchange rules reflect the crucial role played by specialists in providing stability, liquidity,
and continuity in the Exchange's market. Recognizing the importance of the specialist in the market, the Act, as well
as Exchange rules, impose stringent obligations upon specialists.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Primary among these obligations is the requirement to maintain fair and orderly markets by engaging in, among other
things, dealings for their own account to minimize the effects of temporary disparity between supply and demand.

Amex Rule 170(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the rule change permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities listed
pursuant to Section 118B to participate in the AHT facility by entering an order for the specialist's account only
to eliminate order imbalances should assist specialists in their obligation to minimize temporary disparity between
supply and demand. In addition, the Commission agrees with the Exchange that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment
trust securities to participate in the AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing
price coupled orders would benefit investors by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative
securities based upon well known market indexes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also believes that the Amex's rule change strikes a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need
to accommodate the needs of investors by increasing liquidity in the listed cash market for derivative securities
based on market indexes, and the need to prevent the potential for manipulation or misuse of information. For example,
although Amex specialists will know which limit order are eligible for execution in the AHT facility, they will not
be able to use this information to their own advantage because Rule 1302(b) is being amended to eliminate the migration
of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission believes that approval of the Amex rule change for a one year pilot period will provide
the Commission and Exchange an opportunity to monitor the operation of the amendments to Rules 1300 and 1302. This
one year period also will allow the Commission and the Exchange the opportunity to monitor specialist compliance
with the amended rules to ensure that specialists are properly executing their responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in its rule filing, the Amex indicated that, during the one year pilot period, the Exchange would study the
operation of the facility to determine if there are any additional issues that need to be addressed. In this regard,
the Commission requests that the Exchange submit a report and analysis, by May 1, 1995, of the following information
(broken down by month): (1) trading volume (trades and number of shares of PDRs and investment trust securities) in
the after-hours session; (2) the number of trades, if any, of (a) single-sided orders, and (b) coupled buy and sell
orders which specialists executed in the after-hours session; (3) the number of shares, if any, of (a) single-sided
orders, and (b) coupled buy and sell orders which specialists executed in the after-hours session; and (4) the number,
if any, of single-sided orders that remained unexecuted at the end of the after-hours session. In addition, the Commission
expects the Amex, through use of its surveillance procedures, to monitor closely the trading of PDRs and investment
trust securities in the AHT facility to ensure that trading in these issues is not subject to any patterns of manipulation
or trading abuses or unusual trading activity. Finally, the Commission requests that the Amex keep the Commission
apprised of any technical problems which may arise regarding the operation of the pilot program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;15) is hereby approved for a one year period until August
29, 1995.

In Amendment No. 1, the Phlx proposed to amend the proposed rule language to: (1) Provide in Rule 509(c), that any meeting
with a specialist as a result of a preliminary determination by the Phlx Quality of Markets Subcommittee that a specialist
has not satisfied the criteria specified in the rule will occur within five days after receipt of notice of such preliminary
determination by the specialist; (2) clarify that any decision reached pursuant to Rule 509 regarding the failure
of a specialist to satisfy the requirements of the rule will be appealable pursuant to Article XI, Section 11&hyph;1(a)
of the Phlx's by-laws; and (3) clarify that the ``weakness'' referred to in Rule 509(b)(4) does not refer to any specific
activity but to the general inability of a specialist to prevent and settle disputes in an orderly manner in the trading
crowd. See Letter from Michele Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Market
Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated April 26, 1994 (``Amendment
No. 1'').

In Amendment No. 2, the Phlx proposed to add Rule 1014(g)(i)(3) to codify that specialists are not eligible for the
enhanced parity treatment proposed herein until they are no longer eligible for the enhanced parity treatment afforded
to new specialist units pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. See Letter from William Uchimoto, First Vice President
and General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, OMS, Division, Commission, dated August 25, 1994 (``Amendment

Description of Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Phlx Rules 119 and 120, generally, and Phlx Rule 1014(g), specifically, direct members in the establishment of priority
and parity of orders on the options floor. These rules provide that when bids/offers are made simultaneously, or when
it is impossible to determine clearly the order of time in which they were made, all such bids/offers shall be on parity,
and as such shall be shared equally. Because all newly listed options classes are subject to multiple listing and all
currently listed ones are or will become so eligible, the current parity participation rule has come under review
by the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange proposes to adopt, on a one year pilot basis, a proposed rule change providing that in certain circumstances
and for certain options classes, a specialist will be eligible to receive an enhanced participation on parity equity
options trades by being counted as two crowd participants (``Enhanced Parity Split''). The Enhanced Parity Split
will only apply to transactions where the contra side order is for more than five contracts, and where the Enhanced
Parity Split does not disadvantage a customer order that is also on parity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange represents that one way to ensure that public customers are not disadvantaged is for a specialist to forego
part or all of his second share of a trade. See Amendment No. 1, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Enhanced Parity Split will apply to all option classes that are listed after the rule becomes effective and for
50% of each specialist unit's listed issues at the time the rule becomes effective. In this regard, each specialist's
registered issues will be divided into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly customer contract volume. The
specialist will be able to choose half of his issues in each volume quartile rounded so that the aggregate number chosen
does not exceed 50% of the total number of issues in all four quartiles. The specialist will be required to submit this
list to the Allocation, Evaluation and Securities Committee (``AES Committee'') for its review and approval. This
list, once submitted to and approved by the AES Committee, will be in effect for the entire one-year period of the pilot
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 509 to empower the AES Committee to oversee each specialist's performance
with respect to the Enhanced Parity Split. A standing subcommittee of the AES Committee entitled the ``Quality of
Markets Subcommittee'' (``Subcommittee'') will be created to review each specialist's performance on a quarterly
basis to assure that four conditions are being satisfied by a specialist who receives the benefit of the Enhanced Parity
Split in his trading crowd. First, the specialist must demonstrate that he is the lead market maker in the trading crowd
as measured by his transacting more contracts in an option class than any Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') in that
issue over the review period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Secondly, the Subcommittee will review whether the specialist has provided the Phlx with adequate market share in
options which are multiply traded. In this respect, the Subcommittee will determine whether the Phlx has transacted
at least 10% of the aggregate customer volume in an issue that is traded by all five options exchanges, at least 15% where
four exchanges trade the issue, at least 20% where three exchanges trade the issue, and at least 25% where only one other
exchange trades the issue. Although this is a measure of the total customer volume executed on the Exchange rather
than solely by the specialist, in the competition for multiply traded issues, the Exchange believes the specialist
is a key party responsible for marketing the issue to upstairs firms, updating markets, and maintaining the limit
order book. A specialist who performs these functions will, the Exchange believes, assist the Exchange in increasing
order flow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, options specialist units must receive a score of at least five on the Exchange's quarterly specialist evaluation.
Rule 515 currently requires specialists to obtain this score for its activities regarding the options classes assigned
to the specialist unit. A specialist who receives a score below five on the quarterly evaluation is monitored by the
Exchange for continued substandard performance and may ultimately have one or more options classes removed and reallocated
to another specialist. For purposes of the Enhanced Parity Split, the failure by a specialist to achieve a score of
at least five on this quarterly review will cause the Enhanced Parity Split to be revoked even if the Exchange determines
not to strip a specialist of assigned options classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the Subcommittee will consider whether a pattern of weakness has been demonstrated by such things as frequent
floor official rulings with respect to any particular options class or crowd and/or by written customer complaints
being received by the Exchange or Subcommittee regarding the specialist in any particular options class.

If the Subcommittee determines that a specialist has failed to meet one or more of these four conditions for any issue
eligible for the Enhanced Parity Split, the Subcommittee must make a preliminary finding that the specialist should
lose the Enhanced Parity Split in that issue. The specialist will be notified of this finding and will be required to
appear before the Subcommittee within five business days after receipt by the specialist of the notice.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 At such meeting, the specialist bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of substandard performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
For example, a specialist might be able to overcome this presumption in the case where he has transacted less contracts
than one ROT in his trading crowd during the review period. In this case, if the specialist can demonstrate that one
large block trade occurred during the review period but for which that specialist would have been the lead market maker,
the Subcommittee may determine that the specialist does not deserve to lose the Enhanced Parity Split privilege.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Any decision of the Subcommittee must be in writing and must be delivered to the specialist on the next business day
following the Subcommittee meeting at which the decision was made. A decision to revoke the privilege will be effective
on the next business day after receipt of the decision by the specialist. A specialist who has lost the privilege may
reapply for it at the Subcommittee's next scheduled review. The specialist may be reinstated if the Subcommittee
finds that the condition which initially caused the revocation of the enhanced participation privilege has been
cured and that no other problems exist. Finally, a specialist will be entitled to appeal any decisions made by the Subcommittee
pursuant to Rule 509.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is necessary because the Exchange has identified the need to attract
new specialist units and to retain and encourage existing specialists units to vigorously trade existing options
classes as well as to aggressively seek and apply for newly allocated classes. The Phlx understands that for the most
part, specialist units can seek specialist privileges or the equivalent lead market maker status for any particular
multiply listed options class on other national securities exchanges. Therefore, in order to compete for specialist
capital and market making talent with other national securities exchanges which list options, the Phlx believes
it is necessary to be able to afford its specialist units with some form of enhanced parity split treatment. Specifically,
in order to address these factors, the Exchange has determined to implement this one-year pilot program to increase
the specialist's participation in certain trades where the specialist is on parity with one or more ROTs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange represents that while ROTs provide critical liquidity to the market making process at the Phlx, under
the Phlx's specialist system, the role of the specialist is to provide leadership, liquidity, and continuity, and
to satisfy market making obligations in multiply listed options classes, particularly at the incipiency of competition
for a multiply traded issue. For the options classes that will be eligible for multiple listing, the Exchange represents
that specialists have also taken on a larger market making obligation in order to accommodate customers in the hope
of garnering critical loyalty that will lead to sustained order flow whether the class is or is not ever actually multiply
traded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a point of clarification, the Exchange states that this proposed rule change will operate in tandem with the enhanced
specialist participation provided for new specialist units pursuant to Phlx Rule 1014, Commentary .17.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Upon approval of the proposed rule change, a specialist will only be eligible to receive the Enhanced Parity Split
described herein once the specialist is no longer eligible for the enhanced treatment available pursuant to Commentary
.17 to Rule 1014.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment letter received opposing the proposed rule change offered two arguments as to why the proposed rule change
is inappropriate.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The commenter first argues that the proposed rule is anti-competitive and will ultimately harm public customers
by acting as a disincentive for ROTs to make competitive markets. Secondly, the commenter argues that a floor official
will be unable to determine whether a customer order is ``disadvantaged'' as prohibited by the rule. He further argues
that tracking which options are entitled to the Enhanced Parity Split and which are not will be a difficult chore and
that the need for elaborate review machinery to assure compliance with the proposed rule change is evidence that the
rule is unmanageable.

Phlx Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this commenter raises the same objections that were raised in connection with the Phlx proposal approved
in the New Unit Enhanced Split Order,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 the Phlx relies on its previous response letter in order to address the objections raised in the Comment Letter.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 In response to the commenter's claims that the rule will work to the detriment of the trading public, the Phlx believes
that the proposal will in fact add liquidity to the market, thus directly benefitting public customers. The Phlx believes
the proposal will attract new specialists to the Exchange and will encourage new and existing specialists to make
tight markets in their selected options classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Phlx argues that
because every newly listed options class is subject to multiple listing, disincentives are created which discourage
specialists from acting as specialists for those new classes of options. The Phlx believes that the Enhanced Parity
Split will counteract these disincentives by offering specialists a direct benefit if they are able to attract order
flow to the Exchange. The Exchange further believes the specialists will be able to attract this order flow, and thus
capitalize on the Enhanced Parity Split, only if they maintain tight markets in their selected options classes. Furthermore,
the proposed rule change provides that the Enhanced Parity Split may not disadvantage an order submitted by a public
customer.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Phlx believes that public customers will directly benefit from the proposed rule change.

In response to the commenter's claims that market makers are unfairly disadvantaged by this proposal, the Phlx makes
several arguments. First, the Phlx disagrees with the commenter's contention that any enhanced split is anti-competitive
because a ROT can always establish priority in a trade by improving the market or by being the first in establishing
a market that would otherwise be on parity. Secondly, the Phlx argues that specialists have responsibilities and
are subject to certain costs that market makers do not have, such as, updating and disseminating quotes, reflecting
all market interest in the displayed quotes, and the fixed staffing cost committed to market making in a particular
issue whether it is active or not. In order to attract specialist units to the Exchange who are willing to accept these
responsibilities, the Phlx believes it is necessary to provide specialists with some benefits that are not available
to ROTs. The Phlx believes that any negative impact to ROTs that may be caused by this proposal is more than offset by
the benefit to the Exchange and its customers of attracting new specialist units to the Exchange and retaining the
services of existing specialist units.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5)
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission
finds that the proposal may serve to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by encouraging
specialist units to maintain tight markets in selected options classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange.
The Commission believes the proposed rule change is a reasonable attempt by the Phlx to enhance the ability of specialist
units to compete for order flow in the environment of multiply-traded options classes. In addition, the protection
of investors and the public interest is maintained because of the procedures being adopted by the Exchange which require
the specialist units to satisfy specific conditions to qualify for the Enhanced Parity Split. Further, the proposed
rule change provides that the Enhanced Parity Split cannot disadvantage a public customer order that is on parity
with a specialist unit.

As the Commission stated in the new Unit Enhanced Split Order, the Commission agrees with the Exchange that in order
to attract order flow to the Exchange, the Phlx needs to be able to attract and retain well capitalized specialist units
that are willing to trade the options classes traded on the Exchange. Additionally, the Commission disagrees with
the commenter that the proposed rule change will disadvantage public customers. On the contrary, the proposed rule
change eliminates any direct injury to public customers by providing that customers orders on parity may not receive
a smaller participation than any other crowd participant, including the specialist. Furthermore, because the proposal
may serve to add liquidity to the market by encouraging specialist units to maintain tight markets in order to attract
order flow to the Exchange, the Commission believes that public customers could benefit from the proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the proposed rule change will
disadvantage public customers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that contrary to the commenter's contention, ROTs may in fact benefit from the Enhanced Parity
Split if specialists are successful in attracting order flow to the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also acknowledges that specialist have responsibilities that ROTs do not have and that these responsibilities
have certain costs associated with them, such as the staff costs associated with continually updating and disseminating
quotes. As a result, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to grant certain advantages, such as
the Enhanced Parity Split, to specialists in order to attract and retain well capitalized specialists at the Exchange.
Accordingly, as long as these advantages do no unreasonably restrain competition and do not harm investors, the Commission
believes that the granting of such benefits to specialists is within the business judgment of the Exchange. Therefore,
even though the proposed rule change could arguably have some negative impact on ROTs, for the reasons stated above,
the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Commission believes that: (1) the review procedures proposed by the Exchange, as discussed above,
adequately ensure that only specialists satisfying the conditions set forth in the proposed rule change receive
the benefit of the Enhanced Parity Split; and (2) in cases where a specialist is found to no longer be eligible for the
Enhanced Parity Split, the appeals procedures proposed by the Exchange adequately protect the due process rights
of such specialists. The Commission believes that these criteria balance the competing interests of the Exchange
and the specialists by ensuring regular review of specialist performance and that specialists' due process rights
are protected in cases where the Subcommittee makes a determination that the Enhanced Specialist Split should be
denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the proposal is being approved on a one-year pilot basis. Accordingly, prior to granting an extension or
permanent approval of the pilot program, the Commission will be able to review the operation of the rule and require
the Exchange to make any changes necessary to ensure that competition is not being unnecessarily restrained and that
investors are not being harmed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Specifically, the Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 strengthens the proposal in several ways. By requiring
specialists to meet with the Subcommittee within five days after receipt of a notice from the Subcommittee, the specialist
is provided with time in which to prepare a response to the claims of substandard performance raised by the Subcommittee.
Similarly, by clarifying that all determinations made pursuant to Rule 509 are appealable pursuant to the procedures
in the Exchange's by-laws, the Commission believes that the proposal does not raise any significant due process concerns.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, even though Amendment No. 1 does not specifically define ``pattern of weakness'' for purposes of Rule
509(b)(4), the Commission does not believe that this lack of specificity will create undo confusion as the application
of the rule. Any specialist that is cited for substandard performance for this reason will still be entitled to a meeting
with the Subcommittee to discuss the reasons for the finding and if an adverse decision is sustained after that meeting,
the specialist will be entitled to appeal that determination. Additionally, a specialist can reapply and have the
Enhanced Parity Split reinstated once the condition which led to the suspension is found to no longer exist. As a result,
the Commission believes that the lack of specificity does not raise any significant regulatory concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Amendment No. 2 merely codifies that intent stated in the original proposal
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 that specialists will only become eligible for the Enhanced Parity Split described herein once they are no longer
eligible to receive the enhanced parity treatment afforded to new specialists pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule
1014.

Entergy Corporation (70&hyph;8445)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, a registered holding company,
has filed an application-declaration with the Commission under Sections 3(b), 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 32 and 33
of the Act and Rules 10, 43, 45, 53, and 54.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entergy seeks exemptions from the Act in connection with the acquisition of the securities of one or more subsidiary
companies (collectively, ``Subsidiary Companies'') which will be engaged directly or indirectly, and exclusively,
in the business of owning and holding the securities of a new Argentine company (``Newco''). Newco will be formed to
bid for the right to build, own and operate proposed high voltage transmission line (``Project'') in northeast Argentina.
Entergy states that Newco would qualify as a ``foreign utility company'' under Section 33 of the Act. Therefore, Entergy
requests that the Commission issue an order under Section 3(b) exempting the certain Subsidiary Companies from all
provisions of the Act that would be applicable to such companies as ``subsidiary companies'' of Entergy. In the Alternative,
Entergy proposes to acquire the securities of the Subsidiary Companies under all other applicable sections and rules
thereunder of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Project is designed to carry electricity from the Yacyreta hydroelectric facility, now under construction,
to the high voltage transmission system owned and operated by Transener S.A. Entergy Currently owns an indirect 9.8%
interest in Transener S.A. through its wholly owned subsidiary company, Entergy Transener S.A., which is also a ``foreign
utility company'' under Section 33 of the Act. The Project is expected to take up to 22 months to complete at a total cost
of up to approximately U.S. $300 million. Entergy will be participating in the Project with a consortium of other U.S.
and international investors (``Consortium'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entergy contends that for various tax and legal reasons, it is preferable to hold its interest in Newco indirectly
through the Subsidiary Companies. Entergy further asserts that the particular ownership structure to be used for
the Project will depend on, among other things, the requirements of the documents relating to the bidding for the Project
(``Bid Documents''). The Bid Documents currently require that the shareholders of Newco, collectively, have an
aggregate net worth of at least $150 million. The terms of the Bid Documents further provide that, during the construction
period for the Project, each shareholder of Newco is jointly and severally liable together with Newco for all obligations
arising out of construction, including damages. In view of such requirements, as well as the possible requirements
of Project lenders, Entergy proposes that it may fully or partially capitalize one or more of the Subsidiary Companies
(but not newco) with amounts up to its proportionate share of the Project's estimated total cost either prior to the
submission of the Cosortium's bid or to facilitate the financial closing of the Project. Entergy expects that its
total investment in connection with the Project, including any contingent liabilities of a Subsidiary Company as
a shareholder of Newco, would in no event exceed $90 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entergy proposes that within 45 days after a determination is made not to proceed with an acquisition of an interest
in the Project, it will liquidate or dissolve the Subsidiary Companies, unless Entergy determines to utilize the
Subsidiary Companies in conjunction with another exempt acquisition under Sections 32 or 33 of the Act. Therefore,
Entergy requests authorization from the Commission to effect such a liquidation or dissolution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The direct or indirect investments in the Subsidiary Companies may take the form of: (1) purchases of capital stock,
partnership interests, notes or other securities; (2) capital contributions or open account advances; (3) guarantees,
letters of credit or other credit support (collectively, Guarantees'') arranged or provided by Entergy in respect
of the securities or other obligations of a Subsidiary Company or Newco in connection with the Project; or (4) any combination
of the above. Investments by Entergy in the capital shares or other equity securities of Subsidiary Companies having
a stated or par value will be in an amount not less than such stated or par value. Open account advances by Entergy to a
Subsidiary Company would be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the advance. Any promissory notes
or other evidences of indebtedness issued by a Subsidiary Company to Entergy would: (1) mature not late than 30 years
after the date of issuance thereof; and (2) bear interest at a rate not greater than the prime rate of a bank to be designated
by Entergy. Any such promissory note or other evidences of indebtedness may, at Entergy's option, be converted to
a capital contribution through Entergy's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entergy requests authority through December 31, 1997 to issue Guarantees in an aggregate amount that, when added
to investments in the Subsidiary Companies and Newco otherwise made as provided above, will not exceed $90 million.
Guarantees may be required, among other things, to satisfy credit support requirements of lenders and other Project
participants under financing documents or other agreements to which the Subsidiary Companies or Newco becomes a
party in connection with the development of the Project. The terms of, and any fees or interest payable in respect of,
Guarantees will be established at arm's length based on market conditions; provided that (1) the term of any Guarantee
would not exceed ten years from the date of issuance thereof, and (2) any fees with respect to any Guarantee would not
exceed three percent per annum of the face amount of such Guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds for Entergy's direct or indirect investments in the Subsidiary Companies and in Newco are expected to be derived
from Entergy's available internal cash resources. Entergy also anticipates that the Subsidiary Companies will
not engage in any financial from external sources in connection with the Project.

 The Department is directing all interested persons to show cause why it should not issue an order exempting each U.S.
computer reservations system (CRS) vendor (1) from the prohibition against providing foreign carriers with marketing
data derived from bookings for domestic travel made within the United States, subject to the comparability and notice
requirements of section 255.10(b), and (2), as to European flag carriers, from the requirement that no marketing
data may be provided a foreign carrier affiliated with a CRS if that system does not provide comparable data to U.S.
participating carriers.

 This proposed final policy statement sets forth the FHWA's policy for addressing the interstate maintenance program
funds transfer provisions of 23 U.S.C. 119(f)(1). The criteria for determining what constitutes adequate maintenance,
which are included in this policy, are associated with only the transfer of Interstate Maintenance (IM) funds and
are not related to the State's responsibility to properly maintain projects constructed with Federal-aid funds
outlined in 23 U.S.C. 116, Maintenance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1993, the FHWA published an interim policy statement on the transfer of Interstate maintenance program
funds at 58 FR 12299, and provided a 60-day public comment period which closed on May 3, 1993. During the intervening
period, FHWA has evaluated the comments and reconsidered its initial position. As a result, the FHWA is proposing
to modify the pavement roughness and faulting criteria and to add additional criteria that were not proposed in the
interim policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 18 State highway agencies (SHAs) and the Highway User Federation for Safety and Mobility (HUFSAM), a public
interest group, provided written comments to the docket established for the interim policy statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SHA comments ranged from administrative type questions, such as requests for clarification of measurement procedures
and use of existing pavement management system data, to fundamental positions on the individual indicators and the
specific established criteria. Some SHAs endorsed various portions of the criteria established, while others took
exception to part or all of the criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HUFSAM strongly endorsed the interim policy. It stressed the need to assure that the Interstate System be maintained
at a very high level and noted that, from its studies, nationwide, the Interstate maintenance funding levels are inadequate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After evaluating the comments received, the FHWA continues to believe that transfers of apportioned IM funds specifically
earmarked for Interstate maintenance to other designated programs should be permitted only when the Interstate
System routes are in a physical, operational, and safe condition and perform at or near the level for which they were
designed, and constructed. Because pavement and bridge activities constitute the major cost items of IM eligible
activities, the interim policy focused on pavement and bridge condition indicators as the determining factors for
eligibility to transfer IM funds. Other essential elements, necessary to maintain the physical and operational
integrity of the Interstate, must also be considered in transportation decisions. Responses to the interim policy,
however, indicate a concern that other essential elements need not be considered in transfer decisions. This was
not the intent of the interim policy statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101(a) of Title 23 U.S.C. defines ``maintenance'' to mean the preservation of the entire highway, including
surface, shoulders, roadside, structures, and such traffic control devices as are necessary for its safe and efficient
utilization. As the IM program now provides the major resources for rehabilitation, resurfacing, and restoration
(3R) work on the Interstate System, extending the service life of all major components and enhancing highway safety
on the system should receive first priority for IM fund use. For example, over 25 percent of the projects and approximately
10 percent of funds from the IM program are currently being expended on traffic and safety improvement projects. The
FHWA supports a continued strong emphasis on safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a sampling of SHA pavement management systems conducted during the past year, the FHWA found that the pavement condition
indicators established in the interim policy are generally collected and used by the States in evaluating the condition
of the Interstate for their own management purposes. While the data collection and reporting procedures differ somewhat,
the fundamental indicators are consistently used by the SHA's to manage their Interstate pavements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed final policy includes the original pavement and bridge condition indicators established in the interim
policy and adds pavement surface friction as a fourth pavement condition indicator. However, the roughness criteria
has been modified and the separate faulting criteria for jointed plain and joint reinforced concrete pavement (JPCP
and JRCP) has been replaced with a single criterion of 525 mm/km (33 inches/mile) for both jointed pavement types.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these interim factors, this proposed final policy statement adds criteria for the additional traffic
and safety related indicators of (1) safety appurtenances, (2) traffic control devices, and (3) geometric elements.
These indicators are equally critical to the Interstate System which relies heavily on the availability of IM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds for continued adequacy. Maintenance of the Interstate System's operational as well as physical characteristics
in a satisfactory manner remains the first priority for the use of these funds.

Pavement Roughness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three SHAs suggested that the International Roughness Index (IRI), developed at the International Road Roughness
Experiment, is not the appropriate measure of rideability. The FHWA recognizes that IRI does have some limitations.
It does, however, provide a common quantitative basis with which to reference the different measures of roughness.
Further, it is currently collected by SHAs and provided to FHWA under the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS)
submission requirements. Although the FHWA is open to use of improved pavement surface rideability measures, until
such time that improved measures and equipment to measure them are accepted and readily available to SHA's, the FHWA
will continue to rely on IRI as the ride indicator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four SHAs commented that the specific IRI criteria of 240 cm/km (150 inches/mile) was too severe. The FHWA disagrees.
The selection of the 240 cm/km upper limit criteria on pavement roughness was directly tied to the FHWA's desire to
require Interstate pavement to be in fair or better condition. The interim policy noted that initial IRI to pavement
serviceability rating
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (PSR) conversion studies
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 indicated a 240 cm/km IRI is equivalent to a PSR range of 3.0 to 3.5. Pavements within this range are classified as fair
in the FHWA's ``1992 Highway Statistics''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 report. Subsequent additional analysis of the IRI/PSR correlation indicates that a 240 cm/km IRI more accurately
reflects a much lower PSR range of 2.5 to 2.8 (pavements in this range are classified as being in poor to mediocre condition
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
). Based on this further analysis, the FHWA has established an upper limit of allowable IRI of 200 cm/km (127
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;/mile). This converts to a PSR of between 2.8 and 3.2 which is more consistent with the FHWA's original objective
that pavements be in fair or better condition
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rutting comments were limited to data collection difficulties and reflected a degree of uncertainty about what data
collection equipment and procedure would be considered acceptable. No comments were received concerning the appropriateness
of the rutting indicator or the established criteria. Therefore the FHWA has retained 15 mm (5/8 inch) as the upper
allowable limit of rutting. Concerns related to data collection equipment and procedures are addressed under ``Pavement
Data Collection,'' later in the preamble.

Faulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SHA comments on the faulting criteria were split evenly; five SHAs thought that the faulting criteria were too
restrictive, while five SHAs commented that the criteria were acceptable. In addition, the HUFSAM found the criteria
acceptable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One SHA recommended simplifying the policy by replacing the separate faulting criteria for jointed plain and jointed
reinforced concrete pavement (JPCP and JRCP) with a single faulting criterion in mm/km (inches/mile) for both pavement
types. A mm/km based criteria would eliminate the need to take joint frequency into account, as the average allowable
faulting per joint would be directly related to the number of joints/mile. The FHWA recognizes the merit in this recommendation
and has replaced the separate faulting criteria of 3 mm on JPCP and 6 mm on JRCP with an equivalent maximum faulting rate
of 525 mm/km (33 inches/mile) for both. This faulting rate is equivalent to 3 mm per joint on typical JPCP with 6 meter
(20 foot) joint spacing and 6 mm per joint on JRCP with 12 meter (40 foot) joint spacing. Because joint spacing varies
between States, the allowable faulting per joint will differ from State to State, even though the faulting rate per
km remains constant.

Administrative_Procedural Tolerance Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most common comment, received from seven SHAs, was that the scope of the application of the criteria was too stringent.
The crux of the argument was that some tolerance limit should be established to allow a SHA in substantial compliance
to transfer funds. A common suggestion was that the FHWA only require that 90 to 95 percent of the Interstate System
meet the criteria before allowing transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that there are continually evolving pavement and bridge needs and, at any one point in time, even
SHAs with exceptionally good pavements might not meet the criteria on 100 percent of their Interstate system. The
FHWA has already provided relief for this situation. The interim policy specifically allows transfer when all criteria
are not met on the Interstate if the work necessary to correct any deficient segments is included in the approved State
Transportation Improvement Program, required by 23 U.S.C. 135(f). This relief is included in the final policy. The
FHWA believes that allowing a 5 to 10 percent exemption or tolerance would be unwise, as it would allow transfer of money
necessary to maintain the Interstate highway system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Pavement Data Collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several SHAs posed comments and questions on data collection and reporting procedures. The primary concern appeared
to be whether FHWA would require a specific data collection effort using some standardized equipment and procedures
that would be different from what is currently used by the individual SHAs. Further, the comments included request
for flexibility in summarizing the data. Several suggested that FHWA should use whatever SHA PMS data was available
to determine the acceptability of a certification accompanying a transfer request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA intends to rely primarily on current surface roughness, rutting, and faulting information contained in
SHAs PMS database(s) and from information reported in HPMS in evaluating the pavement component of State certifications
accompanying Interstate maintenance fund transfer requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes the uniqueness of each SHA's PMS and the diversity of equipment and procedures used by the SHAs
to meet their particular pavement management needs. The FHWA is not prescribing new specific uniform data collection
equipment, procedures, sampling, or data reduction techniques to determine compliance with the pavement Interstate
maintenance transfer criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Bridges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only two SHA's commented on the bridge section of the policy. Both endorsed the use of the current National Bridge Inventory
(NBI) bridge deck condition rating (Item 58) as an indicator and supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria requirement that bridge decks have a condition rating of 5 or better. This is consistent with the long standing
use of a deck rating of less than 5 to determine a structurally deficient bridge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both States also recommended that FHWA include the NBI ratings for superstructure and substructure in the policy
and delete the load posting requirement contained in the interim policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA originally considered using superstructure and substructure ratings as specific criteria when it initially
developed the interim policy. Upon further consideration, FHWA still supports ``load posting'' criterion which
reflects superstructure and substructure condition ratings and is also a measure of potential safety concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for load posting is an end result of applying superstructure and substructure conditions, along with other
factors, in making load carrying capacity calculations. Changes in condition ratings, and therefore, the load posting,
are affected by a reduced maintenance effort which eventually leads to continual and long-term deterioration of
bridge elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the SHAs further recommended that the FHWA incorporate failure susceptibility as an indicator. Failure susceptibility
is not required nor normally assessed by States in the course of inspecting bridges to meet national bridge inspection
standards. As a result, the FHWA believes it would be inappropriate to use failure susceptibility as a nationwide
criterion in the IM fund transfer policy, and has not included it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one SHA recommended that bridge railing adequacy should be included in the decision factors. The FHWA considered
including bridge railing adequacy as indicated by NBI Item 36 in the early development of policy criteria. The NBI
Item 36 is a four segment item that rates bridge railings for adequate impact strength, and approach guardrail for
adequate vehicle safety and protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adequacy of bridge railings and approach guardrail is a serious safety concern and should be considered in the
States' maintenance program as well as in developing highway safety projects.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has the responsibility to devise strategies to reduce the number of motor vehicle collisions and to save lives
and reduce injuries and property damage through the prevention and reduction in severity of motor vehicle collisions.
NHTSA's Office of Crash Avoidance Research conducts and manages research intended to: analyze driver-vehicle interaction,
identify specific vehicle designs, components, or parameters associated with driver performance errors and resulting
collisions, and develop and evaluate vehicle-based collision avoidance countermeasure concepts and devices.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1.6 million truck tractors and 3.6 million trailers in use in the motor carrier industry today.
IVHS technology offers a significant potential to improve the productivity of the industry and help reduce the approximately
200,000 crashes in which these vehicles are involved each year. To date, the application of these technologies to
commercial vehicles has been limited to single unit trucks and truck tractors because of constraints inherent in
the present combination-unit truck trailer electrical powering and signalling communication system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditionally, the U.S. trucking industry equipment needs have been supplied by the truck/tractor manufacturer
(supplying the towing unit) and the trailer manufacturer (supplying the cargo space to move goods). The two units
are married at the fifth wheel of the power unit and the king-pin of the trailer. Communication and powering between
the tractor and trailer consists of little more than supplying power and control from the tractor to the running lights
of the trailer through the standard seven pin electrical connector (seven circuits). One of the primary reasons for
lack of technology change in the standard seven circuit connection between the tractor and trailer is that any change
may result in lack of compatibility between tractors and trailers operating in the U.S. However, the defense, aerospace,
and computer industries have begun to focus on commercial vehicle applications as a potential new market for their
innovative ideas and advanced technologies to improve safety, efficiency and productivity. In order for these advances
to happen, they must comply with the needs and objectives of the users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle/unit locators, vehicle/driver trip loggers, on-board weight measurement and recording systems, vehicle
maintenance status monitor/recorder/transmitters, administrative credentials transponders, etc., are envisioned,
and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors, resulting in significant operational efficiency
benefits. Likewise, sideward-looking, reward-looking, and forward-looking collision avoidance systems, driver
performance monitors, antilock and electronic braking systems, brake maintenance status monitors, etc., are envisioned,
and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors to enhance their operational safety performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the application of these developing technologies to commercial vehicles has been limited predominately
to the power unit. There is clearly a need to overcome the inherent constraints presently found in the communicating
and powering system between tractors and trailers. These constraints are exacerbated in the case of multi-unit combination
tractor/trailers, the vehicle type which will likely have an increased future role in improving the productivity
of the motor carrier industry. The ability to install advanced technology IVHS productivity and safety enhancing
equipment on this type of vehicle may be a key element in making their expanded future use practical and acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of possibilities have been suggested this issue, including but not limited to: radio/telemetry communication
linkages among units in the combination, communications signal multiplexing, voltage enhancements, wiring system
upgrades, additional electrical circuits and/or wiring connector systems, etc. The successful introduction of
any or all of these approaches will hinge on whether they can be integrated, and be compatible with existing equipment
in the current commercial motor carrier fleet. A comparative evaluation of these approaches, and fleet demonstrations
of the most promising among these, will help foster the implementation of IVHS technology in this application.

Objective
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assess the functional capabilities and limitations, as well as the reliability and practicality, of alternative
means of providing power to and sending/receiving communication signals to/from multiple numbers and different
types of advanced technology safety and productivity enhancing systems on multi-unit combination heavy commercial
tractor/trailers. Assessments will be made with a view to fostering the ability of system suppliers and truck users
to commercially deploy these type systems.

Research Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that a teaming approach may be necessary to conduct this research. One or more cooperative agreements
are envisioned in which a consortium of organizations with experience in truck/tractor manufacturing, trailer
manufacturing, electronic system and component development, wiring and connectors, vehicle test and evaluation,
and motor carrier operation (in the case of an in-service demonstration project) appear ideally suited to pursue
this program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the potential for cost sharing, the performing organization may retain the rights to any proprietary product
or technology developed under the agreement, subject to a government use license. The organization would be free
to pursue commercial development and marketing for the products. NHTSA will require deliverables, however, which
could include reports suitable for publishing in the public domain to document such items as the research methods
and system evaluation results. Certain proprietary information, such as algorithms, need not be released in the
public domain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that one or more cooperative agreements may be awarded under this program. Projects will be funded
incrementally, with up to a three-year support period. The maximum funding level that is anticipated for the total
project is $575,000, excluding cost sharing provided by the performing organization(s). The maximum incremental
funding available in any one year is anticipated to be $300,000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The application package must be submitted with OMB Standard Form 424 (Rev. 4&hyph;88, including 424A and 424B),
with the required information filled in and the certified assurances included. While the Form 424&hyph;A deals with
budget information, and Section B identifies budget categories, the available space does not permit a level of detail
which is sufficient for a meaningful evaluation of proposed costs. A supplemental sheet should be provided which
presents a detailed breakdown of the proposed costs, as well as the costs which the applicant proposes to contribute
in support of this effort, or any additional financial commitment made by other sources. The budget detail shall include
all cost components of the project. Labor categories, hourly labor rates, and projected labor hours for each category
should be included, as well as all materials, computer time, test facility fees, etc. For planning purposes, the required
briefings, during the agreement performance period, will be conducted at NHTSA in Washington, DC.

Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to conduct a recurring computer matching
program matching Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefit recipient records with VA pension and parents' dependency
and indemnity compensation records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of this match is to compare income status as reported to VA with benefit records maintained by RRB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to match records of veterans and surviving spouses and children who
receive pension and parents who receive dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) from VA with Railroad Retirement
benefit records maintained by RRB. The match with RRB will provide VA with data from the RRB Research File of Retirement
and Survivor Benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA will use the data to update the master records of VA beneficiaries receiving income dependent benefits and to adjust
VA benefit payments as prescribed by law. Currently, information about a VA beneficiary's receipt of RRB benefits
is obtained from reporting by the beneficiary. The proposed matching program will enable VA to ensure accurate reporting
of income.
