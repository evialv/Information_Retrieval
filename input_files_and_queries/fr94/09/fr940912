 This document makes final an interim rule that amended the pink bollworm regulations by removing Craighead, Cross,
Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas, Concordia Parish in Louisiana, and Washington County
in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas, and removing Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States
quarantined because of the pink bollworm. The interim rule was necessary to relieve restrictions on the interstate
movement of regulated articles from certain previously regulated areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In an interim rule effective and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 27965&hyph;27966, Docket No. 94&hyph;034&hyph;1), we amended the pink bollworm regulations
in 7 CFR part 301 by removing Craighead, Cross, Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas; Concordia
Parish in Louisiana and Washington County in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas in &sect;301.52&hyph;2a.
We also stated that the interim rule would remove Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States quarantined to
prevent the spread of the pink bollworm since there would not be any areas in those States regulated because of the pink
bollworm. We stated that change would affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.52&hyph;2a; it should have stated it would affect &sect;301.52(a). However, we inadvertently left that
action out of the amendatory section of the interim rule. This final rule corrects that omission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before August 1, 1994. We did not receive any comments
by that date. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule modifies the minimum size requirements for all varieties of potatoes, except round reds, grown in
certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, and for imported long type potatoes. Currently,
the minimum size requirement for all varieties, except round reds, is 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. This
rule specifies that, in addition, at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 percent of the potatoes in each lot, by weight, must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 ounces or heavier. Requiring handlers to ship heavier potatoes should correct a marketing problem by providing
the heavier potatoes demanded by the market and increase returns to producers and handlers. As provided under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the changes will also apply to imported potatoes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 945 [7 CFR part 945], as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order,'' regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho,
and Malheur County, Oregon. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule, which also affects the import requirements for long type Irish potatoes, is also issued pursuant
to section 8e of the Act. The provisions of section 8e and the potato import regulation are discussed later in this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final has been reviewed under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is not filed
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 60 handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes that are subject to regulation under the order,
and approximately 2,000 producers in the production area. In addition, at least 75 importers of Irish potatoes are
subject to import regulations and will be affected by this rule. Small agricultural service firms, which include
handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
The majority of the importers of potatoes may also be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of &sect;945.341 Handling regulation of the order's rules and regulations,
and is based on a unanimous recommendation made by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee (committee), the agency
responsible for local administration of the order, at its June 7, 1994, public meeting. The committee's recommended
revision is authorized pursuant to &sect;&sect;945.51 and 945.52 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality assurance is very important to the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato industry. Providing the public with acceptable
quality produce which is appealing to the consumer on a consistent basis is necessary to maintain buyer confidence
in the marketplace. The committee reports that potato size is important to buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several decades, the minimum size requirement for all varieties of Idaho-Oregon potatoes, except round reds,
has been 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. However, the committee reports that the industry has been losing
its share of the potato market, because the market in recent years has been demanding potatoes larger than this minimum
size. Consumers now expect some baker size potatoes in the packages they buy. In spite of an industry campaign to encourage
handlers to voluntarily ship larger potatoes, a number of handlers have continued to ship potatoes that barely meet
the minimum size requirement, depressing the price for other potatoes. These potatoes are generally shipped in consumer
packs (e.g., 5- or 10-pound bags) or in 100-pound sacks for later repackaging into consumer packs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These shipments have resulted in disappointment by buyers and consumers in recent years, hurting the quality image
of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, reducing repeat purchases and overall sales volume, and resulting in declines
in prices, which has hurt the overall sales volume.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To better meet market demand regarding the size of potatoes, the committee recommended an additional requirement
that at least 40 percent of the potatoes in each lot must weigh at least 5 ounces. It is anticipated that requiring handlers
to ship such heavier potatoes will enable the industry to regain its lost share of the market and increase returns to
producers and handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8e of the Act requires that when certain domestically produced commodities, including Irish potatoes, are
regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements, subject to concurrence by the U.S. Trade Representative. Section 8e also provides
that whenever two or more marketing orders regulating a commodity produced in different areas of the United States
are concurrently in effect, the Secretary shall determine which of the areas produces the commodity in more direct
competition with the imported commodity. Imports, then must meet the quality standards set for the particular area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of potatoes, the current import regulation [7 CFR 980.1] specifies that import requirements for long type
potatoes be based on those in effect for potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County,
Oregon, during each month of the marketing year. While no changes are required in the language of section 980.1, imports
of long type potatoes would have to meet the increased minimum weight requirements proposed herein.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability to imports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is being removed from the handling regulations. That paragraph states the same information that is contained in section
980.1 of the import regulations. Since the same information applicable to imported potatoes is contained in the import
regulations, paragraph (i) in the domestic handling regulations is being deleted to eliminate duplication or confusion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 9, 1994 [59 FR 40477]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until August 24,
1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the new shipping season for the 1994&hyph;95
crop of Russet Burbanks began September 1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many potatoes
of the 1994&hyph;95 crop as possible; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period and no comments were
received.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations concerning the importation
of horses by adding Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, the Member States of the European Union,
Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro
and Serbia) to the list of countries where contagious equine metritis (CEM) exists, and by adding Oman, Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates to the list of countries considered to be affected with African horse sickness (AHS). Outbreaks
of CEM, a highly transmissible venereal disease, have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland,
Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia
(Montenegro and Serbia). The Member States of the European Union either are affected with CEM or trade horses freely
with other Member States that are affected with CEM, without testing the horses for the disease. Oman, Qatar, and the
United Arab Emirates trade horses freely with other countries where AHS, a fatal viral disease, exists. The interim
rule imposed prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of horses that have been in these countries to protect
horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. Neither disease is known to exist in the United States.

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts interim regulations
that amend FCA regulations relating to collateral evaluation requirements for Farm Credit System (FCS or System)
institutions engaged in lending or leasing. The FCA Board also requests comments on these regulations. The amendments
respond to issues raised by regulatory revisions recently adopted by the other Federal financial institutions'
regulatory agencies (Federal regulatory agencies),

I. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA Board adopted final collateral evaluation regulations on November 12, 1992. The regulations were published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54683), and became effective March 1, 1993. The regulations addressed the System's collateral
evaluation practices and procedures, including the need for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Consistent methodology; (2) independence and controls; and (3) consistent educational and qualification requirements.
The regulations set basic requirements for real property appraisals, including the use of State licensed and/or
certified appraisers, functional independence, and compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practices (USPAP). The real property appraisal requirements adopted were similar to the requirements of the other
Federal regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the present amendments is to provide additional flexibility in appraisal and independence requirements,
without jeopardizing the overall integrity or enforceability of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations.
By providing additional flexibility in the use of State-sanctioned appraisers and relief from the more stringent
real estate appraisal requirements, the FCA addresses regulatory burden concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments are being adopted as interim regulations with a delayed effective date and request for comments in
order to provide interested parties an opportunity to comment on the regulations. However, the FCA believes adopting
the regulations in final is required to provide System institutions with the necessary guidance to address revisions
to their collateral evaluation requirements and necessary staffing needs. The regulatory revisions also establish
requirements that are similar to the requirements recently adopted by the Federal regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA adopted, on May 5, 1994, a ``no action'' position relative to the System institutions' compliance with certain
real estate appraisal requirements in response to the then-pending regulatory revisions by the Federal regulatory
agencies. The FCA's ``no action'' position was intended to serve as a temporary means of eliminating any competitive
disadvantage suffered by System institutions. However, the ``no action'' position provides more flexibility than
the FCA would consider a prudent long-term regulatory position. Therefore, these regulatory revisions are intended
to eliminate any competitive disadvantage for the System institutions and establish the necessary guidance and
parameters for the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These revisions to the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations only address the issues associated with the real
estate appraisal requirements and do not lessen the overall requirements that have been established for the basic
collateral evaluation requirements or the collateral valuation process. The FCA Board is aware of the System's concern
about informational requirements for small loans. The FCA has received comments requesting consideration of guidance
for ``minimum information'' loan programs (including financial reporting and collateral evaluation information)
and related underwriting standards. The FCA believes these regulations provide flexibility to accommodate minimum
information loan programs. However, the FCA will consider these issues at a later date in response to the ``regulatory
burden'' notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also make technical revisions to part 614, subpart L, concerning credit denials and independent
appraisal requirements. Finally, the regulations reconcile FCA regulations pertaining to the release of collateral
evaluation information (part 618, subpart G), with the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as interpreted
by Regulation B.

 The ECOA requires creditors to provide copies of real estate appraisals to applicants/borrowers when the appraisal
covers residential collateral. The Federal Reserve Board, on December 16, 1993, published final regulation revisions
(58 FR 65657) (Regulation B) implementing this requirement. Institutional compliance was required by June 14, 1994.

A. Bank and Thrift Federal Regulatory Agencies' Positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 10, 1993, the four Federal regulatory agencies responsible for regulating banks and thrifts issued a joint
interagency statement that eased certain regulatory constraints on the availability of credit for small business
loans (including farm loans). The ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability'' (``Policy Statement'')
identified five areas of concern for possible regulatory and operational revisions. The five areas are: (1) Lending
to small- and medium-sized businesses; (2) real estate lending and appraisals; (3) appeals of examination decisions
and complaint handling; (4) examination processes and procedures; and (5) paperwork and regulatory burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FCA was not a party to the Policy Statement released on March 10, 1993, it does have real property appraisal regulations
in place that are similar to those of the Federal regulatory agencies. In addition, the Policy Statement includes
farming operations as a segment of the small- and medium-sized businesses to be covered by any revisions arising from
the Policy Statement. Therefore, any change in the Federal regulatory agencies' real property appraisal requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will impact the FCA and the System in terms of the consistency and application of the collateral evaluation requirements.

The OCC, FDIC, FRB, and OTS jointly published revised real estate appraisal regulations on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482),
which were effective on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In discussing the real estate lending and appraisal concerns, the Policy Statement asserted that ``in some cases
currently required real estate appraisals may not add to the safety and soundness of the credit decision. Indeed,
in some cases, appraisals may prove so expensive that they make a sound small- or medium-sized business loan uneconomical.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 President Clinton directed the Federal regulatory agencies to review the existing real property appraisal regulations
and address changes as appropriate. The policy position implemented by the Federal regulatory agencies is considered
to be ``one aspect of an overall effort by the agencies to evaluate carefully and react appropriately to risk in the
United States financial services industry. That overall effort envisions substantial oversight; in some cases,
more than we have now, in areas that pose greater risk to the system. By the same token, regulatory burden will be reduced
where risk is low, especially for strong, well-managed banks and thrifts *&blank;*&blank;*.''

On June 4, 1993, the bank and thrift Federal regulatory agencies published proposed regulations (58 FR 31878) to amend
the existing real property appraisal regulations. On November 10, 1993, the Federal regulatory agencies solicited
additional comments on the database supporting the

B. FCA's Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board adopted a policy position requesting public comment on possible regulatory burden
issues addressing a variety of subjects. This ``Regulatory Burden'' statement was published on June 23, 1993 (58
FR 34003). On July 15, 1993, the FCA Board directed staff to begin considering appropriate revisions of the FCA's regulations
and to monitor the progress of the regulatory revisions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA received 15 comment letters in response to its regulatory burden statement from various System institutions
and related parties addressing collateral evaluation related issues. The commenters, in general, supported the
positions that had previously been proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The commenters also expressed concerns
with the inclusion of specific standards of the collateral evaluation regulations (i.e., general valuation and
personal property requirements) as well as specific requirements of part 614, subpart L, as they pertain to the appraisal
requirements for reconsideration of loan denials. In addition, the FCA has received two additional sets of comments
requesting that the FCA consider the positions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA responds to the
comments received in Section IV,

III. Historical Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has not identified any System institution that has failed solely because of poor or fraudulent appraisal activities.
However, there have been institutions that have failed where poor collateral evaluation practices have been a contributing
factor. A review of several of the institutions that failed during the 1980s has indicated that when such institutions
failed, they exhibited characteristics such as: (1) Poor credit administration practices; (2) poor internal controls;
(3) poor collateral evaluation practices; and (4) lack of credit expertise to handle increased debt levels and loan
volume. The majority of the institutions that failed or required some form of assistance did so because of losses experienced
in a few large, complex, and/or specialized loans. Poor collateral evaluation practices coupled with one or more
of the other characteristics described above contributed to the problems faced by the institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the implementation of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations, the institutions have been required to
establish and implement appropriate collateral evaluation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures
are needed to address collateral evaluation independence requirements and basic evaluation and appraisal standards,
as well as educational and qualification requirements. The development of such policies and procedures coupled
with appropriate internal controls, credit controls, and underwriting standards (i.e., lending limits, financial
and repayment analysis, loan inspections, etc.) will help ensure that past problems are not repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA's collateral evaluation regulations require that all System institutions will perform a collateral evaluation
on all secured loans and leases. Such collateral evaluations will take the form of a basic valuation or a more detailed
real estate appraisal, depending on the loan collateral and the specifics of the loan decision. The basic requirements
concerning individuals responsible for collateral evaluations address minimum education, qualification, independence,
and methodology standards that are either established by the regulation or must be established by the institution's
policies and procedures consistent with the requirements of the regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The additional requirements for completion of real estate appraisals, including the use of State-sanctioned appraisers,
require a higher degree of independence and higher education and methodology standards. While higher standards
are desirable, it has been argued by the System, as well as by the banking and thrift industries, that universal application
of these higher standards and the additional cost involved do not add to the safety and soundness of these institutions.
They argue that such higher standards add unnecessary costs and delays to the credit process without providing a corresponding
reduction in loan defaults and losses in the institutions' smaller loans. The System and commercial banking institutions
further argue that collateral valuations completed by qualified and experienced persons, other than State licensed
or certified appraisers, are more appropriate and cost-effective for the majority of their loans and the associated
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that it is the responsibility of the institution to establish adequate policies and procedures for
collateral evaluations, taking into consideration the basic requirements of the FCA's regulations. The institutions
are responsible for determining the level of documentation required, depending on the size, complexity, and specialization
of the loan transaction. As an example, a $50,000 loan that qualifies for an institution's minimum information program
could require considerably less support, information, and documentation than a $500,000 loan to finance a large,
complex dairy operation not typical of the operations within an institution's territory. Under these revised regulations,
both loan transactions could qualify as collateral valuations rather than as real estate appraisals; but the complexity,
size, and specialization of the loan for the dairy operation would call for a higher degree of support information
development and documentation. The FCA notes that such flexibility already exists in the current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lending institution, not the collateral evaluator, is ultimately responsible for its credit decisions. The
collateral evaluation is only one of several factors that must be considered when making a credit decision. While
the collateral evaluation report must be completed by a qualified individual, institutions should not assume that
the acceptance of the collateral evaluation report substitutes for or completes the credit decision process. The
FCA expects the institutions to consider all relevant credit factors (including the collateral evaluation) as part
of the credit decision. If an institution is not comfortable with the reported value of the collateral, the institution
can request another evaluation, decrease the loan amount accordingly, or, provided other statutory and regulatory
requirements are satisfied, change the terms of the loan consideration in recognition of the perceived collateral
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution need not lend 85 percent of the value shown by an evaluation. Rather it should limit the credit to the
amount that can be supported by consideration of the risk associated with all credit factors, including the collateral
evaluation. It is important to note that as the complexity or specialization of the subject property increases, the
degree of support documentation should also increase and should take into account the unique characteristics of
the property that make it complex or specialized.

IV. Regulatory Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Taking into account the comments received in response to the FCA's ``regulatory burden'' notice, the FCA staff studied
FCA's current collateral evaluation regulations, compared current regulations with those of the other Federal
regulatory agencies, and completed a study of data submitted to the FCA by the System. Based on its study, the FCA has
adopted the following positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Increased Appraisal Thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels on the appraisal requirements of the System institutions to $250,000. In addition, the threshold for the functional
independence requirements would also be increased in connection with the appraisal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the FCA completed an analysis to determine the segregation by size of the collateral securing the System's
loan portfolio. The database for the analysis included a summary of the number and volume of loans within the FCS banks
and associations as of December 31, 1991, that were unsecured, secured by personal property, secured by real property,
or secured by a combination of security types. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data were further segregated by loan-size categories. The FCA study has subsequently been updated to reflect
the December 31, 1992, and December 31, 1993, loan-size and collateralization information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has also recently received the results of a study it commissioned through the University of Illinois to perform
independently of the development of these regulations (University of Illinois study). This study examined the loan
origination volume, associated defaults, and loan losses for a specific Farm Credit district for a period between
1973 and 1992 to determine, among other things, whether large loans have a higher default rate than small loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Farm Credit Council, on behalf of the System institutions, has provided additional loan-size and
loan-loss data to the FCA for further consideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level. Finally, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has also completed a survey,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 which included a sample of 246 commercial banks of various sizes and portfolio structures. The survey stratified
the loan portfolios by loan size and by loan type (construction, farmland, multifamily, and nonfarm).

The total sample of the ABA survey consisted of 9,329 banks of various sizes with 51,931 loans reported for a total sample
volume of $22 billion (average size loan is $424,000, average size farmland loan is $83,900, and average commercial
loan is $820,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon review of the available data, the University of Illinois' study data, the System's data, and the ABA's commercial
bank data, several conclusions can be drawn. Each of the studies attempted to study the correlation between loan losses
and loan size. There appears to be very little difference in the average size of the ABA reported farmland loans and
the System institutions' loans. The establishment of a consistent threshold level would encompass similar percentages
of the farmland-based loan portfolio of System institutions and commercial banks. However, the System institutions
will have a greater percentage of farmland-based loan volume that would be in excess of a $250,000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

level. An increase in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level would result in the System institutions being afforded the same flexibility as the commercial lenders to perform
collateral valuations rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USPAP-based, State-sanctioned appraisals. This will result in a significant reduction in the number of loans that
would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the use of a State-sanctioned appraiser
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and thus result in cost savings to the borrowers/consumers. The System data indicate that the difference in the cost
of an appraisal versus a valuation averages approximately $300 per evaluation. Such reported cost differences are
consistent with cost data that have been reported by the commercial banking industry.

requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA recognizes that increasing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level will reduce the number of transactions requiring a USPAP appraisal completed by a State-sanctioned appraiser.
The FCA's analysis of the available data suggested that for loans in excess of $250,000, the rate of loss justifies
the cost of the USPAP appraisal requirement, while for loans of less than $100,000, the cost of requiring USPAP appraisals
may exceed the volume of losses. For loans in the $100,000 to $250,000 range, the data do not clearly establish that
the rate of loss justifies the cost of requiring USPAP appraisals. Therefore, the FCA believes that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level of $250,000 is a reasonable point above which the additional appraisal requirements are justified. In addition,
the FCA is comfortable that safety and soundness concerns at or below $250,000 can be adequately addressed by the collateral
valuation requirements of the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
 Business Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The regulations amend &sect;614.4260(b) to provide the System institutions with a $1.0 million threshold for requiring
appraisals for small- and medium-sized ``business loans'' where the loan repayment is not derived from the sale or
cash rental of real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this exemption is to provide greater flexibility for institutions to provide credit to small- and medium-sized
businesses where the owners are subject to the risk of operational losses. The exemption is not intended to ease credit
requirements for real estate investors or passive landowners. A $1.0 million exemption would be consistent with
the positions taken by the Federal regulatory agencies and will afford the System institutions a ``level playing
field'' with respect to the required use of State-sanctioned appraisers. Based on FCA's analysis of the data studies,
it should be noted that, in addition to the additional 15 percent (by number) of System loans exempted by the new $250,000
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level exception, approximately an additional 5 percent of the number of loans will be exempted by the $1.0 million
``business loan'' exemption.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, within this $250,000 to the $1.0 million category, an additional 25 percent of loan volume will be exempted
by the new business loan exemption. These additional loans represent a significant proportion of System loan volume
and arguably pose significant additional risk for System institutions. Because of this concentration, the FCA has
provided additional criteria for the completion of collateral evaluations for such small- and medium-sized business
loans by requiring all real estate collateral evaluations in excess of $250,000, not otherwise exempted by &sect;614.4260(c),
to be completed in conformance with the USPAP. Such collateral evaluations of ``business loans,'' while conforming
with USPAP, will not necessitate the use of a State-sanctioned appraiser or compliance with the functional independence
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the regulations allow institutions to use either a State licensed or State certified appraiser for loan transactions
under the $1.0 million level, the regulations require appraisals of real estate transactions over $1.0 million to
be completed by State certified appraisers. The FCA notes that this requirement is consistent with the requirements
of the Financial Institutions Recovery, Reform, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which requires the use of a State certified appraiser for a real estate transaction appraisal of $1.0 million or more.

C. Additional Collateral

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations expand the exceptions for the use of State licensed and certified appraisers to include those instances
where the real estate is taken as additional collateral or where the loan is supported through conclusive documentation
of earnings capacity and repayment ability evidencing that the real estate is not necessary to support the loan decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of the additional collateral exception and clarifying the ``abundance of caution'' exception gives System
institutions more flexibility in relying on collateral valuations of real property rather than USPAP-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-sanctioned appraisals. However, the FCA believes that the basic collateral valuation requirements and the
institutions' policies and procedures will provide sufficient analysis and detail to address any safety and soundness
concerns.

D. Limit Periodic Appraisals

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations amend &sect;614.4260(c) to permit the use of collateral valuations of real estate when a subsequent
transaction is related to the advancement of additional funds, a servicing action, loan reamortization, etc., provided
there has been no obvious and material change in the market conditions or physical aspects of the real estate that would
threaten the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction. The regulations
continue to require the institutions to develop appropriate policies and procedures addressing the circumstances
and frequency for the completion of real property appraisals versus collateral valuations, subject to the specific
requirements of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revision would provide greater flexibility to the System institutions in determining the appropriate collateral
evaluation method to employ (valuation vs. appraisal) and the appropriate level of evaluator expertise required
in relation to the associated credit risk. This revision would allow institutions to use collateral valuations instead
of appraisals when a loan servicing action is required, a loan is being reamortized, or even when additional funds
are advanced as long as the collateral risk has not materially increased. This revision would also eliminate the requirement
that a new appraisal be completed if additional funds are advanced and an appraisal has not been completed within 2
years, as was previously required by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These exemptions only address the use of real estate appraisals and are not intended to eliminate the need for a review
and update of the value of the collateral through the use of a collateral valuation. The FCA's regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;614.4260(c)(5)) would require a new evaluation for reamortizations of loans if there has been a material
increase in the associated risk in concert with the advancement of new funds. This position is consistent with the
requirements of the Federal regulatory agencies for transactions where new funds are advanced and there has been
a material increase in the associated risk. However, in addition, the FCA, based on safety and soundness concerns
identified in previous System practices, has taken the position that any loan servicing action (including reamortizations,
collateral releases, etc.) should be accompanied, at a minimum, by a collateral valuation that is consistent with
the requirements of these regulations.

E. USPAP ``Departure Provision'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations amend &sect;614.4265(h) to remove the prohibition on the use of the USPAP ``Departure Provision.''
The removal of the restriction will allow institutions to determine the best evaluation method to support the credit
decision consistent with safe and sound lending practices that also best serves the borrower. The elimination of
this restriction will also provide more flexibility for the institutions in the use of their appraiser resources
by allowing State licensed and certified appraisers to complete updated appraisals and collateral valuations that
would not otherwise meet the USPAP standards requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA and the Federal regulatory agencies originally included the restriction on the use of the ``departure provision''
because they were concerned that the use of the provision would result in an evaluation that is less than reliable.
However, upon further discussion and clarification from the Appraisal Foundation,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 the Federal regulatory agencies now recognize that a ``departure provision'' appraisal provides the basic information
and valuation criteria required to ensure a reliable valuation process.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the prohibition on the use of the ``departure provision'' has been removed.

F. Technical Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations make technical amendments to subpart F pertaining to issues such as an institution's review requirements
for appraisals completed by other financial institutions or government agencies. The FCA has eliminated the review
procedures from &sect;614.4255(d), because it is recognized that other U.S. Government agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government-Sponsored Enterprises and/or Federally regulated financial institutions are all guided in their appraisal
requirements by USPAP and FIRREA requirements, which are at least as encompassing as FCA's regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the regulations make technical amendments to part 614, subpart L, concerning an institution's responsibilities
for accepting an independent appraisal completed in response to a credit denial action. In addition, the regulations
make changes to part 618, subpart G, concerning an institution's obligation to provide applicants with copies of
collateral evaluations on residential properties as required by amended provisions of regulations implementing
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters, responding to the FCA's ``Regulatory Burden'' notice, requested clarification as to the appropriateness
of providing time limits on how long an applicant can delay a credit reconsideration while waiting for the completion
of an independent appraisal. The FCA believes that this is a valid concern, which should be addressed by a revision
to the regulation to require the completion of the evaluation within a reasonable timeframe, depending on the nature
and complexity of the appraisal assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has also noted that the Federal Reserve Board's amendment of Regulation B, the regulations that implement
the ECOA, requires that System institutions provide copies of collateral evaluation reports, containing all pertinent
information, to unsuccessful applicants for credit that would have been secured by residential real property. Therefore,
the FCA's current regulations pertaining to the release of information must be revised to expressly permit the release
of collateral evaluation information when required by the provisions of the ECOA and related regulations. The ECOA
regulations generally require the institution, in the case of residential properties, to provide the applicant
a copy of the complete evaluation report including any third-party information if it is used as part of the institution's
evaluation process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System institutions should note that, in those cases where disclosure of such collateral evaluations is required
by the ECOA, there is no protection for confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party information. Therefore, System institutions should avoid the use of such confidential information
where disclosure is likely under the ECOA (i.e., loans secured by residential properties, including farmland loans
where a dwelling is taken as part of the security). Confidential third-party information does not include information
that would otherwise be publicly available (e.g., contained in the public land records).

G. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters have expressed concerns with the level of requirements and standards for collateral valuations
on real estate and, in particular, the requirements for personal property valuations and the use of the income approach
for evaluations. The commenters objected to requirements they felt were not consistent with the requirements imposed
by the other regulators on their regulated banking institutions.

However, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has recently recommended that the bank and thrift Federal regulatory
agencies establish a set of minimum standards for real estate evaluations where the use of State-sanctioned appraisers
and compliance with USPAP are not required.

 The FCA, by previously adopting and publishing the requirements of &sect;614.4250 of the regulations, has addressed
similar concerns for the System institutions' valuation of real, personal, and intangible property in general.

In addition, the OCC has recently published proposed revisions to its lending limit regulations that would require
appraisals/evaluations of collateral used to secure loans where the lender requires collateral (including personal
property) to support lending in excess of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15-percent lending limit. This position is also consistent with the regulatory standards and guidance previously
established by the FCA in the collateral evaluation regulations. The FCA's willingness to adopt a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25-percent lending limit for FCBs and direct lender associations is supported by the recognition that collateral
evaluation requirements serve as an essential control (58 FR 40311, July 28, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has also reviewed concerns previously expressed by the System, which pertain to the required use of the income
approach for real estate evaluations in excess of the de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level (whether an appraisal is required or not). The FCA has clarified in the regulations that the income approach
is one of the three prescribed methods of valuing collateral under USPAP. Therefore, whenever USPAP standards are
employed the income approach must be considered. If it is not used as a valuation method, there must be an explanation
of why it was not used, accompanied by the development of the initial income-producing information to support its
lack of relevance as a valuation method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;614.4265(d) the FCA requires the institution to develop and document, as part of the supporting information
for the credit analysis, the income-producing capacity of the subject real estate as well as the operations of the
business. This information may or may not be derived directly from the real estate evaluation process, but is required
as part of the credit analysis to support the debt repayment analysis. Such information is intended to assist in identifying
debt coverage shortages that must be addressed by other sources of income. However, the FCA strongly suggests that
the income approach be used on agricultural properties where the loan transaction exceeds the $250,000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The income analysis requirement contained in the regulation does not apply to loan transactions at the $250,000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level and below. However, prudent business practices may dictate the development and use of such information in a
much wider range of loan transactions. The institutions have the responsibility to identify those instances where
the credit risk and the associated credit decision would require the support of the income and debt coverage analysis.

V. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The present revisions of the FCA collateral evaluation requirements will benefit the System institutions by allowing
them to enjoy a competitive playing field with the commercial banking industry and relieving some requirements that
have been identified as burdensome and unnecessary. The FCA Board believes that these revisions can be made without
undermining the basic collateral evaluation requirements or jeopardizing safety and soundness. Therefore, the
FCA Board is able to increase the flexibility of the regulations in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency
of the System's collateral evaluation practices.

Sales comparison approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the procedure that values property by comparing the subject property to similar properties located in relatively
close proximity, having similar size and utility, and having been recently sold in arm's-length transactions (comparable
sales). The sales comparison approach requires the evaluator to estimate the degree of similarity and difference
between the subject property and comparable sales. Such comparison shall be made on the basis of conditions of sale,
financing terms, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, and income characteristics. Appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the sales price of the comparable property based on the identified deficiencies or superiorities
of the subject property to arrive at a probable price for which the subject property could be sold on the date of the collateral
evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The board of directors of each Farm Credit System institution that engages in lending or leasing secured by collateral
shall adopt well-defined and effective collateral evaluation policies and standards, that comply with the regulations
in this subpart, to ensure that collateral evaluations are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sufficiently descriptive and detailed to provide ample support to the institution's related credit decisions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Performed based on criteria established for the purpose of determining the circumstances under which collateral
evaluations will be required and when they will be required. Such criteria must, at a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Establish when an institution will require a collateral appraisal completed under the USPAP rather than a collateral
valuation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Take into account such factors as market trends, market volatility, and various types of credit, loan servicing,
collection, and liquidation actions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Completed by a qualified evaluator in an unbiased manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The policies and standards required by this section shall, at a minimum, address the criteria outlined in &sect;&sect;614.4250

 Collateral evaluation standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When real, personal, or intangible property is taken as security for a loan or is the subject of a lease, an evaluation
of such property shall be performed in accordance with &sect;614.4260 and the institutions' policies and procedures.
Such a collateral evaluation shall be identified as either a collateral valuation or a collateral appraisal. Specifically,
all collateral evaluations must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Value the subject property based upon market value as defined in &sect;614.4240(l); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be presented in a written format; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider the purpose for which the property will be used and the property's highest and best use, if different from
the intended use; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Be sufficiently descriptive to enable the reader to ascertain the reasonableness of the estimated market value
and the rationale for the estimate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Provide sufficient detail (including an identification and description of the property) and depth of analysis
to reflect the relevant characteristics and complexity of the subject property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Analyze and report, as appropriate, for real, intangible, and/or personal property, on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The current income producing capacity of the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A reasonable marketing period for the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The current market conditions and trends that will affect projected income, to the extent such conditions will
affect the value of the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The appropriate deductions and discounts as they would apply to the property, including but not limited to, those
based on the condition of the property, as well as the specialization of the operation and property; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Potential liabilities, including those associated with any hazardous waste or other environmental concerns;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Include in the evaluation report a certification that the evaluation was not based on a requested minimum valuation
or specific valuation or approval of a loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of determining appraisal value as required in section 1.10(a) of the Act, the definition of market
value and the requirements of this subpart shall apply.

Independent collateral evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An applicant for a loan that has been denied may, as part of the request for a review, request an independent collateral
evaluation by an independent evaluator, as defined in &sect;614.4440 of this subpart, of any interests in property
securing the loan (other than the stock or participation certificates of the lender held by the borrower). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within 30 days after a request for a collateral evaluation, the credit review committee shall present the applicant
or borrower with a list of three independent evaluators approved by the qualified lender. The borrower shall select
and engage the services of an evaluator from the list to perform the collateral evaluation. The collateral evaluation
must be completed within a reasonable period of time. The cost of the evaluation shall be borne by the applicant or borrower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The credit review committee shall consider the results of any such collateral evaluation in any final determination
with respect to the loan or restructuring, provided the applicant's or borrower's evaluator has provided a copy of
the evaluation report to the lender not less than 15 business days prior to any scheduled meeting of the credit review
committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any such collateral evaluations that are not completed in conformance with the collateral evaluation requirements
described in subpart F of this part, relative to collateral evaluation standards, independence requirements, and
qualification requirements, need not be considered by the credit review committee. To facilitate the proper completion
of such collateral evaluations, a copy of part 614, subpart F, shall be provided to the borrower for presentation to
the borrower's evaluator, and a copy signed by the borrower's evaluator shall be a required exhibit in the subsequent
evaluation report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board, adopts new final regulations governing the Farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit System's (FCS or System) preparation and reporting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide financial information to investors. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule requires that each bank of the System, the Federal Farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Financial Assistance Corporation) jointly publish periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to investors and potential investors in Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt obligations and consolidated bank debt obligations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Farm Credit System (FCS debt obligations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the rule is to ensure that timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System institutions. The required report to investors must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present Systemwide combined financial statements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental financial statement information, and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses pertaining to System institutions on a combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. The final rule covers Systemwide financial and non-financial information now regularly disclosed by the
Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation in annual and quarterly information statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and press releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations generally parallel the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farm Credit System Disclosure Program (System Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program) and should not impose any significant additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens on System institutions. Consistent with the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disclosure Program, the final rule preserves the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting relationship between a System bank and its related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the System Disclosure Program, the Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, on behalf of the System, periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributes to investors a disclosure document containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide financial information. The System institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that participate in the System Disclosure Program (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the System banks, the Funding Corporation, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Financial Assistance Corporation
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
) jointly publish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report to Investors of the Farm Credit System (FCS Report) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an annual basis. The FCS Report includes an Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement and a general report. The Information Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains combined financial statements and related analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertaining to all System institutions. The general report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains other information about the System, its debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations, and the environment in which it operates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the quarter that coincides with the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year, System institutions also jointly publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly Information Statement. In connection with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sale of debt securities, the Funding Corporation routinely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributes the FCS Report and quarterly Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement to the investment dealers and dealer banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(selling group) that sell FCS debt securities. The FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently has no regulations that specifically govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's disclosure of Systemwide financial information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors.

II. Statutory Authority and Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 5.17(a)(8) of the Farm Credit Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1971, as amended (1971 Act), 12 U.S.C. 2252(a)(8), the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is authorized to ``Regulate the preparation by System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors of information on the financial condition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations of such institutions. *&blank;*&blank;*'' On February 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, the FCA proposed regulations for a new part 630, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disclosure to Investors in Systemwide and Consolidated Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Debt Obligations of the Farm Credit System, to govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's preparation and reporting of Systemwide financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to investors. (59 FR 5341) In general, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations reflected the current division of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the institutions participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System Disclosure Program, and included requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosures similar to those contained in the Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements currently published by the System. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions participating in the System Disclosure Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were designated as the ``disclosure entities'' in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, in recognition of their shared responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disclosure of Systemwide financial information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors and the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion of the Final Rule and Summary of Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA is adopting part 630 largely as proposed. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule includes changes and clarifications to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received on the proposed rule. As in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the final regulations (1) Require the System to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish annual and quarterly reports to investors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) delineate responsibilities relating to the preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the report; (3) reinforce internal controls over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide financial disclosure; and (4) establish reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for the report to ensure that relevant information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the combined financial condition and results of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations of the System is disclosed to investors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential investors. The final rule will prevent any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency between Systemwide disclosure to investors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCA regulations governing accounting and reporting standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and individual System institution disclosure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shareholders. These new FCA regulations will apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information currently contained in the System's Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements and press releases that contain Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial information. The final rule also implements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 514 of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Soundness Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;552 (1992 Act), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires adequate disclosure to investors of financial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflict-of-interest information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations will ensure that timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System institutions. This is consistent with the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board's regulatory policy to ``Protect the public, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors, and the customer/shareholders of the System in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to create an environment whereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customer/shareholders and investors can take advantage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the System's strength and rely on its future viability with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence.'' (

FCA Board Policy Statement on Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Philosophy, 59 FR 32189, June 22, 1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA received six comment letters on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations during the comment period, which expired on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 20, 1994. One letter was submitted by the Farm Credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership. The FCC comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were the product of input from a number of sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including System banks, the System's Accounting Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work Group, and the Funding Corporation. The FCC recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and concurred with the FCA's efforts to ensure that timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accurate Systemwide financial information continues to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be disclosed to investors and potential investors in FCS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt securities. Noting the System's general support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations, the FCC submitted comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several provisions of the proposed regulations in the body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its letter and provided technical comments on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in an attached appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit Bank of Texas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FCBT), and the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore (FCBB) each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted a letter addressing specific issues. The Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation commented concerning its access to FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination Reports of System banks and associations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCBT addressed the same issue in its letter. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FCBT urged that the FCA prohibit directors of System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from serving on the System Audit Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While endorsing the comments submitted by the FCC, the FCBB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged that the FCA clarify, for purposes of Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure, the treatment of the FCBB's wholly-owned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiary, the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AICPA) and Price Waterhouse, the external auditor currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged to provide an opinion on the Systemwide combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements, also commented on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Both of these commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for an accountant's opinion on supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be clarified. The AICPA also commented on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues concerning the definition of ``material,'' the due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates of the reports to investors, and the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing a letter with the FCA explaining the preferability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accounting change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the FCA published the proposed rule, the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report entitled ``Farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit System: Repayment of Federal Assistance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competitive Position'' (GAO/GGD&hyph;94&hyph;39, dated March 10, 1994), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which recommended that the FCA require the System to exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's combined financial statements because of the GAO's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
view that exclusion is the most appropriate accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. On May 10, 1994, the FCA responded to the GAO's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation in a letter to Congressional committees which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described the FCA's approach to Insurance Fund reporting as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in this rulemaking. The final regulations require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the System prepare the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles (GAAP), provide supplemental financial statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data with and without the Insurance Fund, and give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thorough discussion and analysis of the fund in the report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to investors. The FCA believes that these regulations, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted, will ensure that investors are provided with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful information regarding the Insurance Fund and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of the fund on the System's financial position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provided below are a section-by-section analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the proposed rule and FCA responses to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 630.2(b) and (h)_Definitions of ``Combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Financial Statements'' and ``Systemwide Combined Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For preparation of the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, the final rule requires that each bank provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Funding Corporation with bank-only financial data as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as with combined financial data of the bank and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related associations. The FCC and the FCBB commented that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations should be clarified to address how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consolidated financial data of a bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be reported in the Systemwide

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To distinguish financial data prepared on a combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis from that prepared on a consolidated basis, a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``combined financial statements'' has been added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.2(b) of the final rule. The definition is added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify that combined financial statements are prepared by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of affiliated entities that share the same financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest regardless of whether any of the entities has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to exercise control over another. In contrast, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated financial statements are prepared by a parent-entity to include the financial data of subsidiaries
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are under its ``control.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent this newly added definition of ``combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements'' from being confused with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``Systemwide combined financial statements'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in &sect;630.2(g) of the proposed rule, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.2(g) has been simplified to define ``Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined financial statements'' as the combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements required by this part. Proposed &sect;630.2(g) also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is redesignated as &sect;630.2(h). The proposed language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying the purpose for which the Systemwide combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements are prepared has been moved and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined with provisions pertinent to financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.20(l).

2. Proposed Definition of ``Material'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.2(f) of the proposed regulations provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``material'' similar to that found in Securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 405. The FCA received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two comments on the proposed definition of ``material.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AICPA asserted that defining ``material'' other than as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in accounting literature would be confusing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent if audits of the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements are required to be performed in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The AICPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended either deleting the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``material'' or amending it to refer to the materiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition in GAAS or in Financial Accounting Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information (FAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA notes that the definition of ``material'' in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule was intended to govern information presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside the basic financial statements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition, the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements required by this part are subject to materiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria established in GAAP. Specifically, pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.3(c),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Systemwide combined financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be prepared in accordance with the accounting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting standards set forth in part 621 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because &sect;621.2(g) defines the term ``material'' in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FAC No. 2, the GAAP definition of ``material'' contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part 621 of this chapter will govern the System's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of Systemwide combined financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, materiality judgments for preparation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide combined financial statements must be made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with GAAP.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC recommended that the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``material'' be expanded to recognize the different levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and disclosure responsibilities of the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks and the Funding Corporation. The FCC suggested two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate definitions of ``material.'' One of the suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions would apply to the Banks' reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities to the Funding Corporation and the second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would apply to the Funding Corporation's disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities on a Systemwide basis as subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under GAAP, individual materiality judgments are made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a case-by-case basis and materiality is measured at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting level in light of surrounding circumstances. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAAP position is supported by FAC No. 2 and recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no general standards of materiality could be formulated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into account all the considerations that enter into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced human judgment. In line with this approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concept of materiality, the FCA believes that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary to include, as suggested by the FCC, two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate definitions of ``material.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materiality judgments regarding information presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside the financial statements, while not covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAAP definition, are governed by current standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materiality under the securities laws.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The FCA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the case law standard of materiality provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient guidance to the System in preparing information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be presented outside the financial statements. To avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any confusion between the GAAP materiality standard which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs preparation of the financial statements, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of materiality enunciated in the case law, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs information presented outside of the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, the proposed definition of ``material'' has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated from the final rule.

3. Section 630.2(g)_Definition of ``Report to Investors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that, although the preamble clarifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the term ``report to investors'' used throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is intended to mean the Information Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently published by the Funding Corporation, confusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists as to whether the term refers to the FCS Report or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Information Statement. Because the FCS Report currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by the Funding Corporation contains certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that is not part of the System Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program, and for which System banks are not responsible, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCC suggested that all references to the ``report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors'' in the regulation be replaced with the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Information Statement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA does not intend to regulate the name of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report required by this part. The term ``report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors'' used in the proposed rule is merely a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the disclosure document required by this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to the FCC's comment, a new definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``report to investors'' has been added as &sect;630.2(g) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to clarify that the term ``report to investors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to in the regulations means ``a report that presents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Systemwide combined financial statements, supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statement information, and related financial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfinancial information pertaining to the System required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this part.'' Under this provision, a document containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only information that is not required by this part and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is clearly identified as separate from the required report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be subject to this final rule.

B. Section 630.3_Publishing and Filing the Report to Investors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 630.3(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA received two comments on &sect;630.3(a), which establishes the due dates for publishing the annual and quarterly
reports to investors. The FCC opined that the word ``publish'' in &sect;630.3(a) is subject to interpretation, and
could mean printed, mailed, or received by the investors. The commenter suggested that the word ``publish'' be replaced
with the phrase ``make available.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 630.3(a) requires not only that the System ``make available'' the report to investors by the dates specified
in &sect;630.3(a)(1) and (a)(2) but that the System take affirmative steps to distribute the report to investors.
One such step, as noted in the rule proposal, is distribution of sufficient copies of the report to the selling group
dealers for subsequent distribution to interested investors. The FCA believes that the suggested substitution
of the phrase ``make available'' may discourage exploration of other report distribution techniques and, accordingly,
has retained the word ``publish'' in &sect;630.3(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AICPA also commented on &sect;630.3(a), suggesting that the FCA reconsider whether the due dates prescribed
in &sect;630.3(a) provide sufficient time for preparation of the combined information from various entities within
the System. The FCA believes that the due dates established in &sect;630.3(a) for publishing and filing an annual
report within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year and a quarterly report within 60 days after the end of each reporting
quarter are adequate. The 90-day requirement for publishing the annual report to investors is consistent with industry
practice. The 60-day requirement for publishing the quarterly report permits the Funding Corporation to publish
the report 15 days after the constituent System banks and associations have filed their quarterly reports with the
FCA pursuant to part 620 of this chapter. In addition, in the event the Funding Corporation is unable to prepare and
publish the report to investors because one or more banks fail to fulfill their responsibilities for providing information
to the Funding Corporation in accordance with &sect;630.4(c), &sect;630.4(a)(7) authorizes the Funding Corporation
to request the FCA to extend the due date for publishing the report to investors. Accordingly, the FCA has adopted the
due dates established in &sect;630.3(a) as proposed.

2. Section 630.3(f)_Banks' Joint and Several Liability for Consolidated Bank Debt Obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.3(f) requires that each report to investors include a statement that Systemwide debt securities and
consolidated bank debt obligations are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The FCC questioned the
statutory basis for this required statement as regards individual bank joint and several liability for consolidated
bank debt obligations. The FCC requested that the FCA provide a legal analysis of the statutory basis and extend the
comment period for this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that no extensive analysis is required to justify the position that consolidated bank debt obligations
are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The basis for this disclosure is found in section 4.4 of the
1971 Act, which clearly establishes joint and several liability of all banks for consolidated and Systemwide debt
regardless of the title of the 1971 Act under which the bank operates. The FCA notes that the 75-day comment period on
these regulations included a 30-day extension of the original comment period and believes that another extension
of the comment period is unnecessary. The FCA has adopted &sect;630.3(f) as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(a)(9) authorizes the Funding Corporation to make a request to the FCA regarding the content
of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks and related associations if the information is necessary for preparation
of the report to investors. Two System institutions_the Funding Corporation and the FCBT_commented on the proposed
provision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Funding Corporation suggested that the regulation be expanded so that, upon its request, each bank would be required
to provide the Funding Corporation with the Reports of Examination and related information for the bank and related
associations. The Funding Corporation is concerned that the regulation as proposed may be interpreted to implicitly
absolve a bank of its responsibility to report to the Funding Corporation any significant regulatory conditions
imposed or actions taken by the FCA against the bank or its related associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, the FCBT supported proposed &sect;630.4(a)(9) as written on the basis that it maintains an appropriate
balance between the confidentiality of examination reports required by &sect;602.205 of this chapter and the need
to provide complete and accurate disclosure to investors required by the proposed rule. Section 630.4(c) sets forth
the responsibilities of each bank for preparation of the report to investors. Based on &sect;630.4(c)(5)(i), which
requires that each bank certify to the Funding Corporation that the bank has submitted all information needed for
preparation of the report to investors in accordance with the instruction of the Funding Corporation, the FCBT concluded
that protection of the confidentiality of examination reports will not encourage banks to avoid their primary disclosure
responsibilities with respect to material matters that may be discussed in the examination report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FCBT supports &sect;630.4(a)(9) as proposed, it commented that the phrase ``if necessary'' leaves doubt
as to whether the Funding Corporation should request the FCA to provide information contained in the examination
reports in all cases or simply in those cases where a bank does not provide information contained in the examination
report to the Funding Corporation. The FCBT requested that the FCA provide a definitive and unambiguous rule regarding
the obligation to furnish copies of these reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments received, the FCA has revised paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), and (a)(9) of &sect;630.4
to clarify that the Funding Corporation is responsible for collecting from each disclosure entity information needed
for preparation of the report to investors, including any information that is material to a single disclosure entity.
Likewise, in accordance with the Funding Corporation's instructions, each bank is responsible for providing the
Funding Corporation with information that is material either to the bank or, on a combined basis, to the bank and its
related associations. If information necessary for preparation of a report to investors that is meaningful and not
misleading is not forthcoming from a bank in accordance with the provisions of &sect;630.4(c), the Funding Corporation
may request the FCA to provide information regarding the content of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks
or related associations necessary to ensure that the information presented in the report to investors is meaningful
and not misleading. The FCA will then make a determination whether to provide the Funding Corporation with relevant
information contained in the Report of Examination or, if appropriate, the entire report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA is cognizant of both the Funding Corporation's desire to have direct access to Reports of Examination and the
FCBT's concern with protection of the confidentiality of the Reports of Examination. The FCA does not believe that
&sect;630.4(a)(9) would relieve a bank of its responsibility to report any significant regulatory conditions that
would have a material impact on the information being presented in the report to investors. It remains the primary
responsibility of each bank to provide accurate and complete information to the Funding Corporation for preparing
disclosure to investors. Each bank is required to certify to this effect to the Funding Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 630.4(a)(9) is established to provide the Funding Corporation with a contingency source for obtaining information
needed to prepare accurate and comprehensive annual and quarterly reports to investors, while maintaining the confidentiality
of the Reports of Examination. However, such requests from the Funding Corporation to the FCA are expected to be rare.
Also, as the FCBT noted in its comment letter, &sect;630.5 prohibits banks from making incomplete, inaccurate, or
misleading disclosures. Failure to disclose material information would violate these regulations and subject
a bank and its officers and directors to possible FCA enforcement action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.4(c)(1) requires that each bank provide the Funding Corporation with information needed for preparation
of the report to investors. The FCC suggested that proposed &sect;630.4(c)(1) be revised to clarify that, for Systemwide
disclosure, information to be provided by each bank to the Funding Corporation includes not only financial information,
but nonfinancial information as well, including information covering structural changes and regulatory enforcement
activity. Proposed &sect;630.4(c)(1) has been clarified to refer to other nonfinancial information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC also suggested that proposed &sect;&sect;630.4(c)(1) and 630.20(m)(3)(i) be revised to clarify that it
is appropriate to include any wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank in the bank-only information. The FCBB submitted
a separate comment in which it urged the FCA to include the FCC's suggestion in the final rule to address the treatment
of the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the FCBB.

To address the concerns raised by the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding a bank's reporting of consolidated financial data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Systemwide disclosure, the FCA has removed the wording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``bank-only'' from &sect;630.4(c)(1) and clarified that, if a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with GAAP, it is appropriate that the bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide consolidated financial data of the bank and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated subsidiaries to the Funding Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes were also made to &sect;630.20(m)(3) and

3. Section 630.4(d)_Responsibilities of Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(d) provides the banks with access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their related associations' auditors for preparation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to investors. The FCC commented that the banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes may need to have access to others, such as legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counsel. To ensure that the banks have the ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain any information necessary to accurately prepare their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission to the Funding Corporation, the FCC suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the regulation include a general statement that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks may have access to any material association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. Under sections 2.2 and 2.12 of the 1971 Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each association is subject to supervision by its related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank. Each Farm Credit Bank is responsible for preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined financial statements of the bank and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations for disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
620 of this chapter. Part 620 of this chapter does not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, specify how the disclosure responsibilities between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks and related associations are shared. To clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue for purposes of part 630, the FCA has expanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;630.4(d) by adding a general statement in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
630.4(d)(1) of the final rule to require that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association provide its related bank with the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to allow the bank to provide accurate and complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the Funding Corporation for preparation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the report to investors. The original text of proposed &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
630.4(d) has been redesignated as &sect;630.4(d)(2).

D. Section 630.5_Prohibition Against Incomplete,

Inaccurate, or Misleading Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC suggested that the FCA clarify that &sect;630.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning prohibition against incomplete, inaccurate, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading disclosure would apply only when the defective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure is material. Since compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure standards of this part is generally subject to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materiality test in any event, the FCA finds it unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to add the suggested materiality language to &sect;630.5 and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted this section as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 630.6(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;630.6(a)(2), officers or employees of a System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution are prohibited from serving on the System Audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee (SAC) because they are not independent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management. The FCBT urged the FCA to prohibit System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directors from serving on the SAC due to potential conflicts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of interest based on competition between System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that the suggested prohibition would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be disruptive to the existing SAC and force the Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation to recruit SAC members from outside the System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FCA views the FCBT's argument as relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less to conflict of interest than to concern regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation of the confidentiality of information reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the SAC. Under section 4.9 of the 1971 Act, directors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and management of System institutions are eligible to serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the board of the Funding Corporation. As a practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, any information available to SAC members is equally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the members of the board of the Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation. Thus, precluding System directors from serving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the SAC would not necessarily prevent confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from being exposed to directors of other System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks. In light of these considerations, the FCA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the rule as proposed but will monitor SAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities for apparent inappropriate use of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the FCA notes that &sect;630.6(a) does not prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding Corporation board from adopting a policy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disqualify System directors from serving on the SAC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that the word ``approve'' contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.6(a)(4)(iii) of the proposed rule implies that the SAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has the authority to dictate individual bank accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies or that the Funding Corporation has the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require banks to uniformly and consistently adopt or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change accounting policies. This was not the intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. The primary duty of the SAC is to ensure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the report to investors jointly prepared by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding Corporation and System banks. The SAC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for overseeing the reporting process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal controls implemented by the Funding Corporation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the System's report to investors. To clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that neither the SAC nor the Funding Corporation is charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the responsibility for dictating individual banks' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting polices, the FCA has substituted the word 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``review'' for the word ``approve'' as suggested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iv) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iv), the SAC is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to review each disclosure document containing Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information prescribed in this part, including annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, quarterly reports, and press releases, prior to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release. The FCC commented that the SAC's responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should pertain only to financial information and disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the annual information statements because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAC generally would not have the expertise to review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate nonfinancial information, such as is found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of business and description of debt securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC also suggested that, to facilitate timely issuance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of quarterly information, the requirement for a review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each quarterly report or press release by the SAC prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its release be eliminated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure the quality of the report to investors, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCA believes that each annual or quarterly report should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed by the SAC in its entirety. Under &sect;630.6(a)(2), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides that ``members shall be knowledgeable in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public and corporate finance and financial reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure,'' members selected to serve on the SAC should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the expertise to review the entire report to investors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including both financial and nonfinancial information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the FCA agrees that the essence of press releases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to provide timely release of interim information and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleted the requirement for a review of press releases by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SAC from &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Section 630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC suggested that the word ``oversee'' contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of the SAC and the bank audit committee be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced with the word ``review'' because the proposed wording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implies that the audit committee would perform a management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function in the System or the bank. The FCC also suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other changes to proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) to avoid this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit committee is commonly recognized as an entity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established to perform an oversight function in the areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial reporting, internal control, and corporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governance. The word ``oversee'' contained in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is consistent with the customary role of audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committees. The FCA has retained the word ``oversee'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii). The FCA notes that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility of the board of each System institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the steps the audit committee should perform to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill its oversight responsibilities. Thus, the boards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual System institutions could charter their audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee to review and direct management to take necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective actions or merely to review and make corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations to the board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC suggested that the proposed &sect;630.20(c)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure requirement for a summary of FCA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions against individual institutions be clarified and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any required discussion of the impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement actions on the System's operations be linked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materiality. The FCA agrees with this suggestion and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised the language of &sect;630.20(c)(2) of the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC expressed the view that the information called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for by &sect;630.20(d)(1) regarding System debt obligations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
too detailed and, thus, impractical. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
630.20(d)(1)(ii) is, in large part, based upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure currently furnished by the System in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Statements. Unless otherwise needed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readers of the report to investors with information needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to understand the characteristics of System debt, the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not expect extensive detail regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of specific debt offerings. To clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position, the FCA has deleted the words ``terms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions'' and added prefatory language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(d)(1)(ii) requiring a description of debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations statutorily authorized to be issued and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently issued by the System, as well as other pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC also requested that the regulation clearly set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the option of incorporating by reference the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quarterly reports to investors into specific offering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents. The FCA notes that the focus of this regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is on periodic reports of the System to investors. It does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not govern offering circulars or specific offering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents. Nothing in this regulation precludes the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from incorporating by reference information contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual or quarterly reports to investors into specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering documents if otherwise appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii) required disclosure of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of loans outstanding that were used to finance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases of stock or other equities of System institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC expressed concern regarding the System's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with this requirement and questioned its relevance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors. The FCC opined that disclosures currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the System in its annual Information Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sufficient. The System's 1993 annual Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement states that association borrowers do not typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase capital stock for cash, but instead add the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate par value of stock to the principal amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related loan obligation. The 1993 report also provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of capital stock and participation certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding at December 31, 1993. The FCC indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System compliance with the proposed requirement could only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be on a prospective basis because System banks do not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system in place to track needed information. Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCC argued that the costs involved in complying with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirement would outweigh the benefits derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the disclosure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA supports the commenter's view that the cost involved in providing meaningful information to investors should
not outweigh the benefits derived. The FCA also notes that &sect;630.20(e)(2), which requires the System to ``describe
the statutory requirement that a borrower purchase stock as a condition of obtaining a loan; how such stock is purchased,
transferred, and retired; and how earnings are distributed,'' will ensure that investors continue to receive information
that describes the nature of borrower stock of the System. As a result, proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii) has been
deleted from the final rule and proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) and (iv) have been redesignated.

4. Section 630.20(g)(1)(ii)_Risk Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion and analysis of the risk exposure of the loan portfolio.
The FCC suggested that the term ``nonperforming loans'' replace the term ``high-risk assets'' in this section of
the regulation because it is more widely used in the commercial banking industry. Use of the term ``high-risk assets''
in proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) is consistent with the recent amendment of the FCA's accounting and reporting
guidelines in part 621 of this chapter. See 58 FR 48780 (September 20, 1993). In the FCA's regulations, the term ``high-risk
assets'' is a generic reference to loans and loan-related assets that are to be categorized for loan performance and
valuation assessment purposes according to the criteria set forth in &sect;621.6 of this chapter. Collectively,
the classifications identified in &sect;621.6 of this chapter are consistent with the terminology used in the commercial
banking industry for nonperforming loans. There is no regulatory requirement to categorize the classification
as ``high-risk assets'' in the report to investors. Rather, proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion
of any risks that could adversely affect the loan portfolio and loan-related assets. Accordingly, the FCA has retained
the term ``high-risk assets'' and adopted &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) essentially as proposed. Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii)
is redesignated as &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii). The FCA further notes that it expects to revisit the issue of accounting
for impaired loans in the future to assess the impact of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, issued by the Financial and Accounting Standards Board.

5. Section 630.20(g)(1)(iii)_Secondary Market Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that secondary market activities have never been and currently are not anticipated to be material
to the System's financial condition. The FCC suggested that proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iv) be modified to require
these activities to be described when they become material to the System's financial condition. The FCA agrees with
the commenter that the System's involvement in the secondary markets should be disclosed to investors when the effect
of such activities on the financial condition of the System is material and has revised proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iv)
to add materiality tests. This provision is redesignated as &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that the System's statutory authority to participate in secondary markets should be disclosed to
investors in any event. A new paragraph has thus been added in &sect;630.20(a)(1)(vi) of the final rule to require,
without regard to materiality, a description of the authority of System institutions to purchase and sell interests
in loans in secondary markets and the risk involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section &sect;630.20(g)(3)(ii) and (iii) require that the System provide a brief description of the System's policies
regarding liquidity and investment. The FCC pointed out that each System bank adopts its own liquidity and investment
policies according to its business objectives. In the absence of universal policies regarding investment and liquidity
among System institutions, the commenter suggested that the proposed regulations be revised to require only a general
description of System banks' policies. The suggested change is consistent with the intent of the proposed regulations.
The FCA has clarified the proposed regulations by revising &sect;630.20(g)(3)(ii)(A) and (g)(3)(iii) to require
a brief overview of liquidity and investment matters.

Section 630.20(g)(3)(iv) requires a general description of the System's risk management practices, including
a brief discussion of derivative transactions. Due to the heightened interest of the public, financial institution
regulators, and Congress in this area, the FCA solicited comments on whether disclosure requirements regarding
derivative activities should be more detailed. The FCC suggested that, given the changing GAAP environment for derivative
transactions, the FCA consider the approach to derivatives activity regulation used by other bank regulators. This
approach requires regulated institutions to adopt policies in accordance with GAAP. The regulator provides any
clarification of GAAP or additional guidance through Call Report instructions or other mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA adopts &sect;630.20(g)(3)(iv) as proposed, with a clarification to provide for a ``brief overview'' of the
System's asset and liability management practices. The FCA believes that this approach to derivatives activities
disclosure is consistent with the FCC's suggestion. In addition, along with other financial institution regulators,
the FCA is monitoring the area of derivatives activities. The FCA will consider requiring more extensive disclosure
based on its assessment of the level and significance of System derivatives activities and as the need for regulatory
policy in this area becomes more clearly defined.

8. Section 630.20(g)(5)_Insurance Fund
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that &sect;630.20(g)(5), which requires a discussion of the Insurance Fund in the Discussion and
Analysis (D&amp;A) section of the report to investors, is unnecessary and would duplicate the disclosure contained
in the notes to the System's combined financial statements. Section 630.20(g)(5) requires a discussion of the purposes
of the Insurance Fund, a schedule itemizing Insurance Fund assets that have been identified for specific purposes,
and an explanation of how expenditures of Insurance Fund assets affect the assets and capital of the System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA does not believe that the requirement of &sect;630.20(g)(5) will result in duplication of information in
the report. Section 630.3(e) provides that ``Information in any part of the report may be incorporated by reference
*&blank;*&blank;* to any other item of the report. Information *&blank;*&blank;* may be presented in any order deemed
suitable by the Funding Corporation.'' Accordingly, the Funding Corporation has the flexibility to determine where
the D&amp;A regarding the Insurance Fund is to be presented. The FCA has adopted &sect;630.20(g)(5) as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA notes that the regulation does not require the D&amp;A regarding the Insurance Fund to be audited. Pursuant
to &sect;630.3(e), the System could opt to include the required D&amp;A in the notes to the Systemwide combined financial
statements and incorporate the disclosure by reference into the D&amp;A. In this situation, the required D&amp;A
regarding the Insurance Fund would be covered in the independent accountant's report on the Systemwide combined
financial statements.

9. Section 630.20(g)(6)_Instructions for Discussion and Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(6)(ii) requires that discussions required by proposed &sect;630.20(g) cover the 3-year
period covered by the financial statements. The FCC suggested that the words ``3-year'' be deleted. In recognition
that the reporting period for the balance sheet is only 2 comparative years, the FCA agrees with the commenter and has
amended &sect;630.20(g)(6)(ii) of the final rule as suggested and revised the introductory paragraph of &sect;630.20(g)
accordingly.

10. Section 630.20(i)_Compensation of Directors and Senior Officers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.20(i) requires the annual report to state that information on the compensation of directors and senior
officers of System banks is contained in each bank's annual report to shareholders and that the annual report of each
bank is available to investors upon request pursuant to &sect;630.3(f). The FCC commented that this requirement
provides no useful information to investors and is redundant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the rule proposal, the FCA is required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 514 of the 1992 Act to ensure that the disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial and conflict-of-interest information by System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel provides investors and potential investors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information necessary to assist them in making investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions regarding FCS debt obligations or institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that information on compensation of System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directors and senior officers presented in individual System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions' disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
620 of this chapter could provide useful information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors in making investment decisions. Thus, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the requirement of section 514 of the 1992 Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(i) requires that the report provide a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informing investors of the availability of such information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA adopts &sect;630.20(i) of the final rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Section 630.20(l) and (m)_Financial Statements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplemental Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.30(l) requires that the System prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and instructions and other requirements of the FCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(m) further requires that the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide supplemental information in addition to the audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements and that the supplemental information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be examined by a qualified public accountant for compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FCA regulations and guidelines and an opinion expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereon. The FCA received comments on proposed &sect;630.20(l) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the AICPA and the FCC and comments on proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(m) from the AICPA and Price Waterhouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to proposed &sect;630.20(l), both the FCC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AICPA suggested, for different reasons, that the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``instructions and other requirements of the FCA'' be deleted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the proposed rule. The FCC was concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed language indicates that regulatory accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices (RAP) may be utilized, causing investor confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the AICPA provided suggested language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would require both the basic financial statement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supplemental information required by proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(l) and (m) to be audited in accordance with GAAS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AICPA asserted that the requirements of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(m) regarding supplemental information disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear to comprise the ``instructions and other requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the FCA'' referred to in &sect;630.20(l) and, further, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAAS addresses auditors' reporting on information presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Price Waterhouse, the external auditor of the System, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also commented on proposed &sect;630.20(m). Price Waterhouse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that the proposed language that ``supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be examined by a qualified public accountant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with FCA regulations and guidelines'' is too broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would be interpreted as requiring the independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountant to render a report on the System's compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all FCA regulations and guidelines. This would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant work by the independent accountant. Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterhouse commented that the proposed regulatory language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.20(m) provides insufficient detail to enable the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
external auditor to determine the scope of additional work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be performed and the type of report to be issued by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditor on the supplemental information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(l) was intended to preserve the FCA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to prescribe additional requirements for preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and presentation of the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. However, after consideration of the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, the FCA adopts the AICPA's suggestion in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to require that both the basic financial statements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supplemental information required by &sect;630.20(l) and (m) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be examined in accordance with GAAS and an opinion expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereon by an independent accountant. This change will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve the FCC concern regarding RAP financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Price Waterhouse's concern regarding the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of supplemental information and reporting by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent accountant. However, to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to revise the format and content specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A of the final rule, the FCA retains the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that supplemental information be prepared in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with any additional FCA guidance or instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

12. Section 630.20(o)_Cross-Reference Sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(o) called for a cross-reference sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
giving the location of information required by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, in the order required, and identified by item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers and captions. The FCC did not object to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of a cross-reference sheet, but suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cross-reference sheet would only be useful to the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should only be required as an exhibit to copies of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report filed with the FCA. The FCA believes the cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the content of the report provides useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to readers of the report. To make this indexing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement more useful to investors, the FCA has revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(o) to inform readers of the location in the report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the information required under the major disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captions of this part.

G. Subpart C_Quarterly Report to Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.40(b)(5) requires that the System file a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``preferability'' letter with the FCA disclosing any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting changes made during the reporting period that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required by new accounting pronouncements. The AICPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the FCC commented that the requirement for filing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate letter with the FCA explaining the reason for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferable alternative accounting principle is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They suggested that the requirement be deleted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.40(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferability letter was intended as a notice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform the FCA of any accounting change made by the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the interim period that is not required by existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting pronouncements. Because the quarterly report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be required to disclose such accounting changes, upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further consideration, the FCA has deleted the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of filing a preferability letter from &sect;630.40(b)(5) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule.

condition and results of operations of System institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as determined by evaluating the amounts and certainty of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cashflows from operations and from outside sources. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information provided pursuant to this section need only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include that which is available to System institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which does not clearly appear in the combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The D&amp;A of the financial statements and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical data shall be presented in a manner designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhance a reader's understanding of the combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition, results of operations, cashflows, and changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital of System institutions. Unless otherwise specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.20(g), the discussion shall cover the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the financial statements and shall use year-to-year comparisons or any other understandable format.
Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trend information is relevant, reference to the 5-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected financial data required by paragraph (f) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section may be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The D&amp;A shall focus specifically on material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events and uncertainties known at the time of reporting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would cause reported financial information not to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily indicative of future operating results or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future financial condition. This should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
descriptions and amounts of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Matters that would have an impact on future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations but that have not had an impact in the past; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Matters that have had an impact on reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations but are not expected to have an impact on future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quarterly report to investors shall contain the information specified in this section along with any other material
information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The quarterly report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and not misleading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rules for condensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this subpart, major captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as those provided
in the financial statements contained in the annual report to investors, except that the financial statements included
in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interim balance sheets. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased
or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interim statements of income. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years
and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim
period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss
years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be
used for purposes of this test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or
in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. It may be presumed
that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year, and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined
in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained
in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices)
and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently
completed fiscal year may be omitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred subsequent to the end of the most recently completed
fiscal year that have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes
since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices, estimates
used in the preparation of financial statements, status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new
indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial assistance received, significant business
combinations and liquidations of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this paragraph, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided
even though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing accounting pronouncements for accounting
changes, state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period covered by the interim financial statements shall
be disclosed, together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any prior period included.
If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item subsequent to the
initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material
information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this section with respect to any item is not material,
it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion and analysis of interim financial condition and results of operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discuss any material changes to the information disclosed to investors pursuant to &sect;630.20(g) that have occurred
during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Provide any additional information
needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the
periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Baltimore, Martin State Airport, MD by amending this area's effective
hours to coincide with the associated control tower hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace
in this area when the associated control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way
radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument
approach procedures when the control tower is closed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Request for Comments on the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. All comments should be submitted, in triplicate, to Mr. Frank Jordan at the address specified above. An informal
docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address specified above. This rule will become effective
on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that
further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule
or to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Baltimore, Martin State Airport, MD, by amending this area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control
tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace in this area when the associated control
tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed
at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the
term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The
former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower.
The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective
hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes
Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when
two-way radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace
for instrument approach procedures when this control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an
immediate need to modify this Class D and establish this Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. it therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Request for Comments on the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. All comments should be submitted, in triplicate, to Mr. Frank Jordan at the address specified above. An informal
docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address specified above. This rule will become effective
on the date specified in the ``DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it
will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Wilmington, DE, by amending this area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of
operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed.
Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at this airport.
However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic
area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous,
while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA
and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace
to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace during the
hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication
with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures
when these control towers are closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an
immediate need to modify this Class D and establish this Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations by adopting final rules to implement, in part, those provisions of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that provide for overtime and premium pay for Customs Officers performing
inspectional services. This document addresses the public comments submitted in response to the interim regulations
which initially implemented the pay reform provisions, and makes certain changes to those interim regulations in
response to the public comments and in order to add clarity and improve the readability of the final regulations.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312) (the 1993 Act)
was signed into law. Part II of Subchapter D of Title XIII of the 1993 Act (107 Stat. 668)_popularly referred to as the
Customs Officer Pay Reform Amendments (COPRA)_amended section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911 (19 U.S.C. 261 and
267) to reform the overtime_and establish a premium_pay system by which Customs Officers who perform inspectional
services would be compensated. In general, while the COPRA retained the basic double-time compensation rate for
overtime services, its three sections (sections 13811&hyph;13813) made certain changes concerning how and when
such Customs Officers would be compensated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13811 (codified, in part, at 19 U.S.C. 267) amended 19 U.S.C. 261, 267, and 1450 (and repealed 19 U.S.C. 1451a)
to create a new and exclusive overtime compensation and premium pay schedule for Customs Officers performing inspectional
services, and required the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to prevent certain abuses that developed
under the old pay system. Section 13812 amended 5 U.S.C. 8331(3) to provide additional benefits for Customs Officers;
it allows overtime compensation to be included in the calculation of Federal retirement annuities, up to an amount
equal to 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay limitation, and authorizes the payment of cash awards to Customs
Officers for foreign language proficiency. Section 13813 amended 19 U.S.C. 13031(f)(3) to make certain adjustments
concerning reimbursements from the Customs User Fee Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 28, 1993, Customs published as T.D. 94&hyph;2 interim regulations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 68520) to implement the provisions of section 13811 of the 1993 Act. (The provisions of sections 13812 and 13813
of the 1993 Act were not dealt with in that document; the regulations implementing those aspects of the pay reform provisions
will be issued by the Office of Personnel Management and Customs at a later date.) The interim regulations amended
and revised certain sections in parts 4, 24, 122, 123, and 134 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR parts 4, 24, 122, 123,
and 134) and solicited comments concerning these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three parties submitted comments regarding one or more aspects of the interim regulations. The comments received,
and Customs responses to them, are set forth below.

Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments received raised, in part, six areas of concern that will be responded to in this document: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Customs interpretation of the exclusivity clause (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)) regarding when and how shift differential
allowances would be paid (19 CFR 24.16(a)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) whether the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'' precluded considerations of other,
alternative work schedules (19 CFR 24.16(b)(16)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the propriety of defining ``work assignment priorities'' in agency regulations (19 CFR 24.16(d)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) the inclusion of workers compensation benefits in the listing of categories for which Customs Officers may receive
pay for work not performed (19 CFR 24.16(e)(2)(ii));

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) the payment of commute compensation when the overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly
scheduled assignment (19 CFR 24.16(f)(2)(v)), and; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from any applicable pay cap calculations (19 CFR 24.16(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain other issues raised by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU, one of the parties submitting comments)
are the subject of pending litigation before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Civil
Action No. 94&hyph;0163, filed January 31, 1994). As it would be inappropriate for Customs to discuss those issues
at this time, those comments are not addressed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. We now address the identified areas of concern in turn.

24.16(a)_Interpretation of exclusivity clause

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the 1993 Act prohibits employees who are paid overtime under subsection (a) of the statute or premium pay
under subsection (b) of the statute from receiving ``*&blank;*&blank;* pay or other compensation for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
that work 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
under any other provision of law'' (emphasis in original), the exclusivity clause contained in the 1993 Act does not
divest employees of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes for work performed during
periods for which no 1993 Act payments are received. For example, an employee may be assigned to a night shift for which
no night work differential is payable under the 1993 Act (11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). That employee should still be paid
night shift differential from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. under the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA) or other applicable
law. The interim regulations should be modified to reflect this entitlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs disagrees. With enactment of the COPRA in the 1993 Act, Congress created a total pay and compensation system
unique to the inspectional duties performed by Customs Officers. The establishment of this new system effectively
removed those officers from coverage under any other statute for pay and compensation purposes. Accordingly, no
change to &sect;24.16(a) is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the COPRA were promulgated, Congress reasoned that its purpose in requiring Customs Officers to work 40 hours
in a week or 8 hours in a day, without regard to the hour of the day or the day of the week, before they qualify for overtime
pay, was to encourage Customs to adjust its inspectional resources to meet actual trade patterns, rather than forcing
the trade community to adjust to a predetermined Customs workday. Also, Congress wanted Customs to measure workload
and trade patterns at each of its ports and then adjust work schedules to meet that demand while using as little overtime
as possible. See, ``Report of the Committee on the Budget House of Representatives on Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993'', Report 103&hyph;111 (May 25, 1993), p. 573. Since section 267(c)(2) clearly provides that a Customs
Officer who receives overtime pay under subsection (a) (19 U.S.C. 267(a)) or premium pay under subsection (b) (19
U.S.C. 267(b)) for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of
law, it is axiomatic that Congress' explanation in the context of overtime pay is equally applicable to the payment
of premium pay differentials, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., night shift pay. And, as no allowance for night work differential premium pay is authorized under the Customs Officer
Pay Reform provisions where less than a majority of night work hours is worked during the specified time periods (19
U.S.C. 267(b)(1)&hyph;(3), 19 CFR 24.16(g)(3)(i)&hyph;(iii)), it is clear that the 1993 Act does divest Customs
Officers_but not other Customs employees_of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes
for work performed. Any other interpretation of section 267(c)(2) would render the express limitation meaningless.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the scenario presented in the commenter's example, the payment of night differential premium pay is not authorized
because the Customs Officer, as defined at 19 U.S.C. 267(e)(1) and subject to the overtime and premium pay provisions
of 19 U.S.C. 267, does not work a majority of hours between any of the three time frames established by Congress for payment
of such premium pay. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(b)(1)(A) through (C). Although the Customs Officer is officially assigned
to work an 8-hour shift which goes past the, heretofore, traditional working day of 6:00 p.m., no night work differential
is authorized under the exclusivity of pay provision under the COPRA (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)); the terms of the exclusivity
provision expressly preclude dual pay/compensation entitlement considerations under other Federal pay statutes.

24.16(b)(16)_Definition of ``Regularly-scheduled administrative workweek''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'', the following sentence should
be added, ``This section is not meant to prohibit consideration of alternative work schedules at a local level'' to
reflect the provisions of 5 CFR 610.121 and Article 21, Section 3A of the National Agreement between Customs and the
National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The pay reform provisions of the 1993 Act do not affect or otherwise address the question of alternate work schedules
(AWS), which has a separate statutory basis. See, 5 U.S.C. 6120 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that the addition of the requested sentence is unnecessary. Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(b)(16)
is made.

24.16(d)_``Work assignment priorities''/(annuity integrity) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NTEU objects to the inclusion of work assignment priorities provisions in the regulations (&sect;24.16(d)),
as these issues are negotiable under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. Especially objectionable is the inclusion
of the overtime earnings ``band'' in &sect;24.16(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs agrees that the inclusion of the equalization provision in the work assignment priorities may be overbroad
as written and could be subject to negotiations under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act; however, Customs believes
that the other two principles (alignment and least cost) are properly contained in the regulations, as they are in
accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(1), which require the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate
such regulations as will prevent the abuse of callback work assignments and commuting time compensation. Accordingly,
&sect;24.16(d) is revised by deleting the equalization principle and replacing it with a more restricted ``annuity
integrity'' principle that is more in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2), which requires the Secretary
to promulgate such regulations as will prevent the disproportionately more frequent assignment of overtime work
to Customs Officers who are near to their retirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annuity integrity is based on the average yearly amount of overtime Customs Officers worked during their career with
Customs. Under annuity integrity the amount of overtime that can be worked by a Customs Officer who is within 3 years
of his/her statutory retirement eligibility, see, 5 U.S.C. chapters 83 or 84, is limited to the average yearly number
of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of
the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory
pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning
this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in
individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of Customs. Customs believes
that this principle of annuity integrity is in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2) and, as such,
properly belongs in the regulations.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NTEU requests the inclusion of workers compensation benefits to the listing of categories for which Customs Officers
may receive payment for work that is not performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unlike the form of workers compensation enumerated in this section (continuation of pay under the workers compensation
law, which is paid by the employing agency), workers compensation benefits_in the form of compensation for lost wages_are
paid by the Department of Labor. See, 5 U.S.C. 8101 and 20 CFR part 10. As this latter form of workers compensation is
not within the direct control of the Secretary of the Treasury, its inclusion at &sect;24.16(e)(2)(ii) would be inappropriate.
Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(e)(2)(ii) is made.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commute compensation provisions include a section that a Customs Officer will not be paid for commute time if the
overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly scheduled assignment. This section makes it
extremely difficult for those inspectors that work Monday through Friday to serve the public on Saturdays and Sundays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This eligibility condition for commute compensation is statutory. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I). Thus, Customs
cannot deviate from the statutory requirements, but does note that the additional compensation_a flat 3 hours at
the basic pay rate_is in addition to callback pay. Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(f)(2)(v) is made.

 The NTEU requests the exclusion of workers compensation benefits and back pay awards and settlements from the listing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from the list of payment categories subject to pay cap limitations,
for the reasons given above at &sect;24.16(e)(2)(ii), no change to &sect;24.16(h) is made. Regarding the exclusion
of back pay awards and settlements, the current regulatory language provides that ``awards made in accordance with
back pay settlements'' shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations. This correctly conveys the fact
that such awards are exempt. Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(h) is made concerning this point.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes discussed above in connection with the analysis of comments, the regulatory texts as set
forth below incorporate certain editorial or other non-substantive changes to the interim regulations to add clarity
and improve the readability of the final regulations. The sections of the interim regulations affected by these changes
are indicated below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the definitions of ``commute compensation'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(5)), ``overtime pay'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(13)), and
``premium pay differential'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(15))_now denominated &sect;24.16(b)(14), see next paragraph below
for explanation on redenomination_encompass similar elements pertaining to compensation, the wording of these
three sections is recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive
meanings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the change to &sect;24.16(d) discussed above under the Discussion of Comments, a definition for ``participating
group'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(14)) is no longer needed. Accordingly, in &sect;24.16(b), paragraphs (15) and (16) are
redenominated paragraphs (14) and (15), respectively.

24.16(c)_Application and bond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the interim regulations did not make any changes to the provisions of &sect;24.16(c), because this section
references Customs ``employees'' rather than Customs ``Officers'', the term ``employee'' in paragraphs (1) through
(3) is replaced with the term ``Officer'' to reflect the new restricted application of &sect;24.16, as amended by
the COPRA provisions of the 1993 Act. This change is made to make the provisions of paragraph (c) more harmonious with
the rest of the provisions in &sect;24.16.

24.16(e)_Overtime pay

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (2)(i) of &sect;24.16(e), the second sentence regarding the rounding off of overtime work performed
in increments other than a full quarter hour is deleted because it seeks to address a problem that is subject to negotiations
under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (2)(ii) of &sect;24.16(e), the last sentence is revised by deleting the words ``for the work assignment''
after ``reports'' and adding the words ``as assigned'' to make it clear that overtime pay is now restricted to hours
assigned and worked.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (3) of &sect;24.16(f), the last sentence regarding the treatment of certain overtime work to prevent
the inappropriate payment of commute compensation is deleted because it represents a regulatory attempt to correct
a scheduling issue. The district director is responsible for and has discretion in scheduling appropriate overtime
assignments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (4) of &sect;24.16(f), a stylistic change is made in the first sentence (changing the reference from
``he'' to ``the officer'') and a modification is made in the second sentence (allowing less than all overtime assignments
to be treated as one continuous callback assignment) to give management more flexibility in the assignment of overtime
work.

24.16(g)_Premium pay differentials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons given above concerning recasting three provisions in &sect;24.16(b) because the terms defined encompassed
similar elements pertaining to compensation, the three provisions in &sect;24.16(g) pertaining to premium pay

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_paragraphs(g)(1) (Holiday differential), (g)(2) (Sunday differential), and (g)(3) (Night work differential)_are
recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive meanings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (1)(iv) of &sect;24.16(g), the first sentence is revised and a second sentence is added to make it clear
that where only one assigned shift is worked and any of those hours occur during the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday,
the entire shift will be designated as a holiday and compensated at the holiday rate of pay. Also, a new paragraph (vi)
is added to clarify the compensation computation where only a portion of a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, holiday
shift is worked.

134.55_Compensation of Customs Officers and employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of &sect;134.55, a grammatical change is made to clarify which regulatory provisions
(COPRA or FEPA) are applicable to provide compensation for which Customs personnel. The change provides that the
COPRA compensation provisions of &sect;24.16 are applicable regarding overtime compensation and premium pay for
Customs Officers, and that the FEPA compensation provisions of &sect;24.17 are applicable regarding overtime compensation
for other Customs employees.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the comments received, Customs believes that the interim Pay Reform for Customs Inspectional
Services regulations, published as T.D. 94&hyph;2 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68520), should be adopted as a final rule with certain changes thereto, as discussed above
and set forth below.

Based on the supplementary information set forth above and because the amendments contained in this document reflect

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., it is certified that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, the regulations are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C.
603 and 604. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O.

 For Customs Officers within 3 years of their statutory retirement eligibility, the amount of overtime that can be
worked is limited to the average yearly number of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career
with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs
Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this
annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by
the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs
or to meet emergency requirements of Customs.

of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then the officer shall be entitled to commute compensation each time the officer
returns to the place of work provided that each assignment commences less than 16 hours after the officer's last regularly-scheduled
work assignment. However, in no case shall the compensation be greater than if some or all of the assignments were treated
as one continuous callback assignment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to place alpha-ethyltryptamine
(AET) into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This action is based on findings made by the Deputy Administrator
of the DEA, after review and evaluation of the relevant data by both the DEA and the Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services, that AET meets the statutory criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the CSA.
Since this substance has been temporarily placed into Schedule I, the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal
sanctions of Schedule I continue to be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, importation and exportation
of AET.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 12, 1993, the Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 13533) amending &sect;1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place AET into
Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which became
effective on the date of publication, was based on a finding by the Administrator that the temporary scheduling of
AET was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. The CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the
temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year from the effective date of the order. However, if
proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) have been initiated and are pending, the temporary
scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under this provision, the temporary scheduling of AET
which would have expired on March 12, 1994, was extended to September 12, 1994 by the Acting DEA Administrator (59 FR
10720).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 7, 1994 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 10718) and after a review of relevant data, the Acting DEA Administrator proposed to place AET into Schedule
I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). Prior to that time the Acting DEA Administrator submitted data which DEA gathered
regarding AET to the Assistant Secretary for Health, delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Acting DEA Administrator also requested a scientific and medical
evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for AET from the Assistant Secretary for Health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 30, 1994, the Deputy Administrator for the DEA received the scientific and medical evaluation
and scheduling recommendation from the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Assistant Secretary recommended that
AET be placed into Schedule I of the CSA based on a scientific and medical evaluation of the available data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of proposed rulemaking for AET provided the opportunity for interested parties to submit comments, objections
or requests for a hearing regarding the scheduling of AET. No comments, objections or requests for hearings were received
regarding the scheduling of AET.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alpha-ethyltryptamine has been classified as a tryptamine hallucinogen. Chemically it is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-ethyl-1H-indole-3-ethanamine or 3-(2-aminobutyl)indole. It is structurally similar to N,N-dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) and N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET) both of which are controlled in Schedule I of the CSA. Available data indicate
that AET produces some pharmacological effects qualitatively similar to those of other Schedule I hallucinogens.
Recent data suggests that AET may produce neurotoxicity similar to the neurotoxic effects produced by MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
and PCA (para-chloroamphetamine).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alpha-ethyltryptamine acetate was marketed by the Upjohn Company in 1961 as an antidepressant under the trade name
of Monase. After less than one year of marketing, Upjohn withdrew its New Drug Application when it became apparent
that Monase administration was associated with the development of agranulocytosis. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under section 505 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act for AET. A search of the scientific and medical literature revealed no indications of current
medical use of AET in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEA first encountered AET in 1986 at a clandestine laboratory in Nevada. Several exhibits of AET have been analyzed
by the DEA and state forensic laboratories since 1989. Individuals in Colorado and Arizona have purchased several
kilograms of this substance as the acetate salt from chemical supply companies and have distributed and sold quantities
to individuals for the purpose of human consumption. Touted as a MDMA-like substance, it has been trafficked as ``TRIP''
or ``ET''. Distribution has been primarily among high school and college-aged individuals. In Arizona, the death
of a nineteen year old female was attributed to acute AET toxicity. Illicit use of AET has been documented in both Germany
and Spain where at least two deaths have resulted from AET overdose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the investigation and review conducted by DEA and upon the scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation
of the Assistant Secretary for Health received in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Deputy Administrator for
the DEA, pursuant to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b), finds that:

(1) AET has a high potential for abuse;

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 812 (g) and (h) of the Fair Housing Act authorize the Secretary to make determinations of reasonable cause
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred. Section 810(c) authorizes the Secretary to refer
to the Attorney General matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements by respondents for enforcement.
Regulations found at 24 CFR parts 103 and 104 govern the conduct of investigations under the Act by the Assistant Secretary
and the taking of enforcement action in a number of situations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955), HUD published a final rule that amended its Fair Housing Complaint Processing regulations,
which are codified in 24 CFR part 103. The purpose of the August 5, 1994 final rule was to advise the public that the Assistant
Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement),
rather than the General Counsel, is authorized (1) to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred and direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations,
and (2) to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This authority was previously delegated to HUD's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel by the Secretary. Through
the August 5, 1994 final rule, the Secretary transferred the delegation of this authority from the General Counsel
and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement. In transferring this delegation, however, the Secretary intended
for the General Counsel to be consulted and to concur in a determination of reasonable cause before the Assistant Secretary
for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity directs the issuance of such a charge. The language requiring concurrence
of the General Counsel in reasonable cause determinations was inadvertently omitted from the August 5, 1994 final
rule, and therefore does not correctly reflect the Secretary's intended delegation of authority on this matter.
The purpose of this document is to correct this error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FR Doc. 94&hyph;19178, a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955) is corrected to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In the preamble, on page 39955, in the second column, under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' the second
and third paragraphs under this heading are corrected to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends portions of 24 CFR part 103 to advise that the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
(and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement) is authorized, with the concurrence of
the General Counsel, to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred and to direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations. The Assistant Secretary
also is authorized to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This authority was previously delegated to the General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel of the Department by the
Secretary. Through this final rule, the Secretary has now transferred the delegation of this authority from the General
Counsel and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary. However, before determining that reasonable
cause exists to believe that discriminatory housing practice has occurred, and directing the issuance of a charge
based on that determination, the Assistant Secretary must receive the concurrence of the General Counsel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the authority cited below, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, derived from the
Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.45, which implements within the Department of the Navy the provisions of Department
of Defense Directives 5400.7 and 5400.7&hyph;R series, Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program
(32 CFR Part 286), and Department of Defense Directive 5400.9, Publications of Proposed and Adopted Regulations
Affecting the Public (32 CFR Part 336). This rule is being published by the Department of the Navy for guidance and interest
of the public in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1). It has been determined that invitation of public comment on these
changes to the Department of the Navy's implementing instruction prior to adoption would be impracticable and unnecessary,
and it is therefore not required under the public rulemaking provisions of 32 CFR Parts 336 and 701, subpart E. Interested
persons, however, are invited to comment in writing on this amendment. All written comments received will be considered
in making subsequent amendments or revisions to 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, or the instruction upon which it is based.
Changes may be initiated on the basis of comments received. Written comments should be addressed to Lieutenant Sulik,
Office of the Judge Advocate General (Administrative Law Division), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400.
It has been determined that this final rule is not a ``major rule'' within the criteria specified in section 1(b) of
Executive Order 12291 and does not have substantial impact on the public.

This subpart prescribes actions to be executed by, or at the direction of, Navy Department [as defined in &sect;700.104(c)
of this chapter] components and specified headquarters activities for apprising members of the public of Department
of the Navy regulations, policies, substantive and procedural rules, and decisions which may affect them, and for
enabling members of the public to participate in Department of the Navy rulemaking processes in matters of substantial
and direct concern to the public. This subpart complements subpart A, which implements Navy-wide requirements for
furnishing documents to members of the public upon request. That a document may be published or indexed and made available
for public inspection and copying under this instruction does not affect the possible requirement under subpart
A for producing it for examination, or furnishing a copy, in response to a request made under that subpart.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code, requires the Department of the Navy to make available for public inspection
and copying documents which have precedential significance on those Department of the Navy decisions which affect
the public. These documents must be kept readily available for public inspection and copying at designated locations,
unless they are promptly published and copies are offered for sale. Additionally, documents issued after July 4,
1967, are required to be indexed on a current basis. These indexes, or supplements thereto, must be published at least
quarterly in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. In determining whether a particular document is subject
to the requirements of this paragraph, consideration should be given to the statutory purposes and legal effect of
the provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statutory purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the purpose of the requirement to provide members of the public with essential information is to enable
them to deal effectively and knowledgeably with Federal agencies; to apprise members of the public of the existence
and contents of documents which have potential legal consequences as precedents in administrative determinations
which may affect them; and to permit public examination of the basis for administrative actions which affect the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a document is required to be indexed and made available under this paragraph, it may not be used or asserted as a precedent
against a member of the public unless it was so indexed and made available, or unless the person against whom it is asserted
had actual and timely notice of its contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes of documents affected. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) which exempt specified matters from the requirements of public disclosure,
the following classes of Department of the Navy documents are included in the requirements of this paragraph: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final adjudicative opinions and orders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_opinions (including concurring and dissenting opinions) and orders which are issued as part of the final disposition
of adjudication proceedings (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) and which may have precedential effect in the disposition
of other cases affecting members of the public; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policy statements and interpretations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_statements of policy and interpretations of less than general applicability (i. e., applicable only to specific
cases; organizations, or persons), which are not required to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but which may have precedential effect in the disposition of other cases affecting members of the public; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manuals and instructions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_administrative staff manuals, directives, and instructions to staff, or portions thereof, which establish Department
of the Navy policy or interpretations of policy that serve as a basis for determining the rights of members of the public
with regard to Department of the Navy functions. In general, manuals and instructions relating only to internal management
aspects of property or fiscal accounting, personnel administration, and most other ``proprietary'' functions
of the department are not within the scope of this provision. This provision also does not apply to instructions for
employees on methods, techniques, and tactics to be used in performing their duties; for example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Instructions or manuals issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Those which prescribe operational tactics; standards of performance; criteria for defense, prosecution, or
settlement of cases; or negotiating or bargaining techniques, limitations, or positions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information concerning munitions, equipment, and systems,
and foreign intelligence operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining whether a document has precedential effect, the primary test is whether it is intended as guidance
to be followed either in decisions or evaluations by the issuing authority's subordinates, or by the issuing authority
itself in the adjudication or determination of future cases involving similar facts or issues. The kinds of orders
or opinions which clearly would have precedential effect are those that are intended to operate both as final dispositions
of the questions involved in the individual cases presented, and as rules of decision to be followed by the issuing
authority or its subordinates in future cases involving similar questions. By contrast, many adjudicative orders
and opinions issued within the Department of the Navy operate only as case-by-case applications of policies or interpretations
established in provisions of manuals or directives and are not themselves used, cited, or relied on as rules of decision
in future cases. In these instances, the underlying manual or directive provisions obviously would have precedential
effect, but the orders and opinions themselves would not have. A recommendation by an official who is not authorized
to adjudicate, or to issue a binding statement of policy or interpretation in a particular matter would not have precedential
effect, though an order, opinion, statement of policy, or interpretation issued by an authorized official pursuant
to such recommendation might have that effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deletion of identifying details. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Although the exemptions from public disclosure described in 5 U.S.C. 552 and subpart B of this part are applicable
to documents which are required to be indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under this paragraph,
there is no general requirement that any segregable portions of partially exempt documents be so indexed and made
available for public inspection and copying. As a general rule, a record may therefore be held exempt in its entirety
from the requirements of this paragraph if it is determined that it contains exempt matter and that it is reasonably
foreseeable that disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by that exemption. An exception to this general
rule does exist with regard to a record which would be exempt only because it contains information which, if disclosed,
would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Where necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of a person's privacy, identifying details should
be deleted from a record which is required to be indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under
this paragraph. In every such case, the justification for the deletion must be fully stated in writing in a manner which
avoids creating inferences that could be injurious to the person whose privacy is involved. Usual reasons for deletion
of identifying details include protection of privacy in a person's business affairs, medical matters, or private
family matters; humanitarian considerations; and avoidance of embarrassment to a person.

 Each component having cognizance of records required under this paragraph to be indexed shall compile and maintain
an index of such records on a continually current basis. Each such index was required to initially be published by July
1, 1975. An updated version of each such index, or a current supplement thereto, shall be published by an authorized
method at least annually thereafter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Commercial publication, provided that such commercial publication is readily available to members of the public,
or will be made available upon request and payment of costs (if this method is utilized, information on the cost of copies
and the address from which they may be obtained shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Furnishing internally reproduced copies upon request, at cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication
in accordance with subpart D of this part, provided that it is determined, by an order published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the publication of the index by methods &sect;701.65(d)(3) (i) or (ii) would be unnecessary or impracticable.
Such order shall state the cost of copies and the address from which they may be obtained. The Chief of Naval Operations
(N09B30) is authorized to issue such an order in a proper case.

 The United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review is deemed to be a ``court of the United States'' within
the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 551 and is therefore excluded from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552. Nevertheless, unpublished
decisions of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review, although not indexed, are available for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of this section are not imposed by statute, but are the implementation of policies and procedures
created administratively in 32 CFR part 336. In effect, the pertinent provisions of 32 CFR part 336 establish, within
the Department of Defense and its components, procedures that are analogous to the public rulemaking procedures
applicable to some functions of other Federal agencies under 5 U.S.C. 553. While the administrative policy of encouraging
the maximum practicable public participation in the Department of the Navy rulemaking shall be diligently followed,
determinations by the Department of the Navy as to whether a proposed regulatory requirement originated by it comes
within the purview of this paragraph and the corresponding provisions of 32 CFR part 336, and as to whether inviting
public comment is warranted, shall be conclusive and final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes of documents affected.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each proposed regulation or other document of a class described in &sect;701.64(a) (or a proposed revision of an adopted
document of any of those classes) which would ``originate'' within the Department of the Navy a requirement of general
applicability and future effect for implementing, interpreting, or prescribing law or policy, or practice and procedure
requirements constituting authority for prospective actions having substantial and direct impact on the public,
or a significant portion of the public, must be evaluated to determine whether inviting public comment prior to issuance
is warranted. Documents that merely implement regulations previously issued by higher naval authorities or by the
Department of Defense will not be deemed to ``originate'' requirements within the purview of this section. If a proposed
document is within the purview of this section, publication to invite public comment will be warranted unless, upon
evaluation, it is affirmatively determined both that a significant and legitimate interest of the Department of
the Navy or the public will be served by omitting such publication for public comment, and that the document is subject
to one or more of the following exceptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It pertains to a military or foreign affairs function of the United States which has been determined under the criteria
of an Executive Order or statute to require a security classification in the interests of national defense or foreign
policy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It relates to naval management, naval military or civilian personnel, or public contracts (e.g., Navy Procurement
Directives), including nonappropriated fund contracts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It involves interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure,
or practice; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) It is determined with regard to the document, for good cause, that inviting public comment is impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unless the official having cognizance of a proposed regulatory document determines under the criteria of &sect;701.66(b)
that inviting public comment is not warranted, he or she shall cause it to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with an invitation for the public to submit comments in the form of written data, views, or arguments during a specified
period of not less than 30 days following the date of publication. An opportunity for oral presentation normally will
not be provided, but may be provided at the sole discretion of the official having cognizance of the proposed directive
if he or she deems it to be in the best interest of the Department of the Navy or the public to do so. After careful consideration
of all relevant matters presented within the period specified for public comment, the proposed document may be issued
in final form. After issuance, the adopted document, and a preamble explaining the relationship of the adopted document
to the proposed document and the nature and effect of public comments, shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 The official having cognizance of a proposed document within the purview of this paragraph shall, if he or she determines
that inviting public comment concerning the document is not warranted under the criteria of &sect;701.66(b), incorporate
that determination, and the basis therefor, in the document when it is issued or submitted to a higher authority for
issuance. After issuance, such document shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

In accordance with the provisions of 32 CFR part 336, the Department of the Navy shall accord any interested person
the right to petition, in writing, for the issuance, revision, or cancellation of regulatory document that originates,
or would originate, for the Department of the Navy, a policy, requirement, or procedure which is, or would be, within
the purview of &sect;701.66. The official having cognizance of the particular regulatory document involved, or
having cognizance of the subject matter of a proposed document, shall give full and prompt consideration to any such
petition. Such official may, at his or her absolute discretion, grant the petitioner an opportunity to appear, at
his or her own expense, for the purpose of supporting the petition, if this is deemed to be compatible with orderly conduct
of public business. The petitioner shall be advised in writing of the disposition, and the reasons for the disposition,
of any petition within the purview of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1994, the USEPA published a final rule, through the ``direct final'' procedure, approving two exemption
requests from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (Act) for the Toledo and Dayton ozone
nonattainment areas in Ohio. See 59 FR 37947. The USEPA is removing this final rule due to adverse comments received
on this action. In a subsequent final rule, USEPA will summarize and respond to the comments received on these exemption
requests from the State of Ohio.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts
I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act'').
EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within
the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620
(November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The
Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992 establishing
this emission statement program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to EPA through the Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: certification of data
accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and
typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statements
data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential
to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that
have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual
and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule-effectiveness
(RE). States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent in submitting their emission
statement and that emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC or 2500 tpy or more of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year.
Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Sections 110(a)(l) and 110(a)(2) of the Act provide that each implementation plan submitted
by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Washington held a public hearing on January 5, 1993 in Vancouver, and January 6, 1993 in SeaTac to solicit
public comment on the implementation plan for the Vancouver Air Quality Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound
Ozone Nonattainment Areas, respectively. Following the public hearing, the plan was signed by the Director of the
Washington State Department of Ecology (the Governor's designee) on January 22, 1993. EPA received an official revision
to the SIP on January 28, 1993 which supersedes the SIP submittal of November 16, 1992. Additionally, replacement
pages were submitted July 5, 1994 to clarify which sources are subject to the emission statement program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness the criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). A
letter dated April 8, 1993 was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next
steps to be taken in the review process. In today's action, EPA approves Washington's emission statement program
SIP submittal and invites public comment on the action.

B. Components of Emission Statement Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Program Elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Washington's emission statement program includes provisions covering applicability of the regulations, definitions
for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific
reporting requirements for sources. Under Washington State law, the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) sections 70.94.141
and 70.94.331 authorize Ecology and local authorities to ``require access to records, books, files, and other information
specific to the control, recovery, or release of air contaminants into the atmosphere.'' The Washington Administrative
Code (WAC) 173&hyph;400&hyph;105 states that ``the owner or operator of a source shall upon notification by the director
of Ecology, maintain records ... deemed necessary to determine whether the source is in compliance with applicable
emission limitations and control measures.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Reporting Requirements for Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Act, Washington's emission statement program requires sources to submit certification that
the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement, source identification
information, operating information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Reporting Requirements for State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Washington's emission statement program includes a provision for the State to provide the identifying information
for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for rule effectiveness utilized by the State
in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and quarterly emission statement status reports.
The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission statements program
requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Washington has submitted quarterly
emissions statement status reports since July 1, 1993. The emissions statement status reports contain all required
data elements. Ecology and the local air pollution control authorities require emission statement data for the annual
emission inventory update. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Sources Covered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone (O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NOx
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the nonattainment areas. Washington's Emission Statement Program applies the source reporting requirements
as outlined in EPA's ``Draft Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program.'' Sources subject
to this requirement are: (1) Sources in O3 nonattainment areas that emit 25 (tpy) or more of NOx; and (2) sources in O3
nonattainment areas that emit 25 tpy or more of VOC. Additionally, if a source emits at least the minimum established
reporting level of VOC or NOx (for example, 25 tpy or more in an O3 nonattainment area), and the other pollutant is emitted
at less than 25 tpy, then the other pollutant should also be included in the emission statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Enforceability Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J.
Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also contain
a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)
of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Washington has a program in its SIP that will ensure that the requirements of sections 182(a)(3)(B), 182(f),
and 184(b)(2) of the Act for emission statement measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced. Submission
of emission statement data is enforced through the Southwest Air Pollution Control Authority (SWAPCA) and the Puget
Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA). PSAPCA requires submission by April 15 of each year, and SWAPCA requires
submission by March 15 of each year. EPA expects that the state's existing air enforcement program will be adequate.

III. Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In this action, EPA is granting approval of the emission statement plan revision submitted to EPA on January 28, 1993
because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

will become effective on November 14, 1994 unless, by October 12, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.

 This action approves a revision to the Texas SIP addressing CO for El Paso. Certain elements of the complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso CO SIP were submitted by the Governor of Texas to the EPA in order to meet the November 15, 1992, deadline for the
purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO. These elements
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO SIP for El Paso. This Federal Register
(FR) action approves some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, including the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory
and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP have been or will be acted upon

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A segment of El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 12.6), under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991), 57 FR 13498, and 13529 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements
for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to 12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and
three of part D, title I of the CAA.

The 1990 Amendments to the CAA made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do
not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the CO NAAQS (see
Public Law Number 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the CAA, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401

The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs
and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals containing moderate CO nonattainment
area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moderate CO nonattainment areas less than 12.7 ppm., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as El Paso, were required to submit SIPs to the EPA by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1992, containing specifically: (1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions
from all sources of CO in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1) of the CAA); (2) no later than September
30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter, until the area is redesignated to attainment,
a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA; (3) a permit program
to be submitted by November 15, 1993, which meets the requirements of section 173 for the construction and operation
of new and modified major stationary sources of CO (section 172(c)(5)); (4) contingency measures due November 15,
1993, that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to attain the primary standards by the
applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); (5) a commitment to upgrade the current I/M program and submit a SIP revision
for the I/M program by November 15, 1993, (section 187(a)(4)); and (6) an oxygenated fuels program

Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations
on April 4, 1994 (58 FR 15683&hyph;15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In this FR action,
the EPA is approving two of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base year CO emissions
inventory, and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP will be acted upon
in separate FR actions.

Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, the EPA proposed approval of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683&hyph;15686), and no comments were received regarding the proposed approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The EPA in this action is approving the following elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP: the 1990 base year CO emissions
inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. These two elements meet all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.
The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP that were submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1992, or by November
15, 1993, will be or have been acted upon in separate FR actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 23, 1992, the Governor of Texas submitted to the EPA a SIP narrative revision for CO concerning El Paso, which
included the general SIP revision and the oxygenated fuels regulations. The State also submitted to the EPA a completed
emissions inventory on November 17, 1992, and a commitment to upgrade the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
I/M program on November 15, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations
on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683&hyph;15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In that rulemaking
action, the EPA described in detail its interpretation of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve these
elements of the El Paso CO SIP after taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. It is important
to note that the El Paso CO 1990 base year inventory consists of the following list of the CO peak season daily emissions
estimates in tons per day (t/d): Point Sources, nine t/d; Area Sources, three t/d; Mobile On-Road Sources, 291 t/d;
Mobile Nonroad Sources, 67 t/d; Total Sources, 370 t/d. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final action on the El Paso CO SIP is unchanged from the April 4, 1994, proposed approval action. The EPA prepared
a detailed analysis in its Technical Support Document as a part of its proposed approval and which is available for
review along with the current FR document at the locations referenced in the beginning of this FR document. The discussion
herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action that the EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the April 4, 1994, proposed approval FR action for a full discussion of the action that the EPA is now finalizing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15683 (April 4, 1994). As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA
received no public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from table two to table three under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989,
and revised via memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the Regional Administrators
dated October 4, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the El Paso CO SIP and is approving the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated
fuels regulations in this action. Other elements described above will be or have been addressed in separate FR documents.

number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 14, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

 of June 30, 1994, EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food additive regulations for benomyl

for the D.C. Circuit ordered EPA on August 24, 1994, to stay the effectiveness of those revocations. By this document,
EPA is implementing the Court's order by reinstating the food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin pending
judicial review of EPA's June 1994 Order by that Court.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33684) (``June 1994 Order''), EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food
additive regulations for benomyl (processed tomato products and raisins), trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint
oil), mancozeb (bran of wheat), and phosmet (cottonseed oil). On July 14, 1994, the registrants for benomyl and trifluralin
filed a petition for review of EPA's June 1994 Order with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In addition,
DuPont and DowElanco filed with the Court a ``Motion for Summary Reversal, or in the Alternative, Stay Pending Review.''
On August 24, 1994, the Court denied Petitioners' Motion for a Summary Reversal, but granted the Motion for a Stay Pending
Judicial Review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this document, EPA is implementing the Court's Order granting a stay by reinstating the benomyl (processed tomato
products and raisins) and trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint oil) food additive regulations pending judicial
review of EPA's decision. These regulations, therefore, will remain in place until the stay is terminated, EPA is
otherwise ordered by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or another court, or EPA takes further administrative action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not reinstating the food additive regulations for mancozeb (bran of wheat) and phosmet (cottonseed oil) because
they were not the subject of the Court's August 24, 1994 decision. Therefore, those regulations continue to be revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until otherwise acted upon by EPA, the Code of Federal Regulations text will continue to include the full text of the
food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin (40 CFR 185.350 and 185.5900).

The Commission adopted this Order on Reconsideration to rule on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order
which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution
Act (TDDRA). The Commission affirmed these rules with minor modifications, consistent with the TDDRA. The rules
are intended to maximize telephone subscribers' protection against fraudulent and abusive practices without unduly
burdening common carriers and providers of legitimate pay-per-call services.

1. On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted an Order on Reconsideration in CC Docket No 93&hyph;22 (released August
31, 1994; FCC 94&hyph;200) (Order) ruling on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order, 58 FR 44769 (Aug.
25, 1993), which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute
Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). As explained below, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications,
regulations governing interstate pay-per-call and similar information services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission modified &sect;64.1506 to clarify that services specifically exempted from the TDDRA's definition
of ``pay-per-call'' need not be offered exclusively through 900 numbers. The Commission stated that it had not intended
to negate the express exclusions from pay-per-call status enacted by Congress in the TDDRA, and, accordingly, amended
&sect;64.1506 to require that any interstate services possessing the basic pay-per-call attributes set forth in
the statute and &sect;64.1501(a)(1)&hyph;(2), and not subject to the exclusions stated in that section, must be
offered only through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission affirmed &sect;64.1508(c) which requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to file federal tariffs
for services that offer subscribers the option of blocking access to 900 numbers and also declined to permit LECs to
satisfy the federal tariffing requirement by cross-referencing applicable state tariffs. The Commission found
that it could implement the TDDRA's mandate that blocking services be reasonably priced most effectively by requiring
the filing of federal tariffs. Federal tariffs assure that the Commission need not review individual state tariffs
or await subscriber complaints to ensure that 900 number blocking is offered to subscribers at a reasonable charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Finally, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications, &sect;64.1510(b) of its rules. This section requires
common carriers billing subscribers for information services provided on either a collect basis or under a presubscription
or comparable arrangement to separate the charges for those services from charges for ordinary telephones services,
to the extent possible, and include in each bill assessing such charges a brief statement of subscriber rights and
responsibilities. Although the Commission recognized that these provisions are not required by the TDDRA, it concluded
that they are necessary to protect consumers from fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the provision
of interstate information services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission noted that subscriber complaints filed with the Common Carrier Bureau over the past several months
confirm and highlight the need for separate billing and consumer notification requirements, particularly when
800 numbers are used to provide information services, purportedly under a presubscription or comparable arrangement.
The Commission's rules require that a valid presubscription arrangement be established as a contractual agreement
between a caller and an information provider (IP) after the caller is fully informed of the rates and conditions for
using the information service and agrees to take the service on the terms offered. The IP must require use of a personal
identification number (PIN) to guard against access by unauthorized persons. However, the complaints received
by the Commission indicate that information providers apparently read the Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
of the originating telephone line and issue a PIN to the caller without ascertaining that that individual is both the
subscriber to the originating line and legally capable of entering into a contractual agreement. The subscriber
to the originating line is then charged for a call to the IP on the basis of ANI and, unless the bill segregates such charges,
the subscriber to the originating line may not be aware that charges for information services have been billed. The
Commission emphasized that this practice does not establish a valid presubscription arrangement and that unless
an IP has ascertained that the subscriber to the originating line is, in fact, the caller who agreed to purchase information
services, the IP may not use ANI in order to bill charges to the originating line. The Commission also noted that LECs
have often used confusing or misleading language in displaying charges for 800 number information services and,
accordingly, directed carriers to render bills that accurately reflect the charges assessed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Commission also ruled that, while IPs generally appear to have abandoned collect calls as a means of providing
information services, LECs should include in their billing contracts a requirement that entities on whose behalf
collect calls are billed take reasonable steps to segregate any collect calls for information services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The Commission amended &sect;64.1510(b) to remove the requirement that carriers inform subscribers billed for
collect or presubscribed information services that 900 number blocking is available upon request since that fact
could confuse subscribers because 900 number blocking would not block collect calls or most presubscribed services,
which are typically offered through 800 numbers. The Commission also modified slightly the terminology used in the
rule to reflect more clearly the type of calls it was designed to cover. Thus, the amended rule deletes the term ``interstate
tariffed collect information services'' and instead refers to ``interstate information services provided on a
collect basis.'' To ensure consistency, Sections 64.1507(c) and 64.1511(a) were also amended to incorporate this
changed terminology.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 bycatch allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery
category which is defined at &sect;675.21(b)(1)(iii)(F), was established as 957 metric tons by the final 1994 initial
specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.21(c)(1)(iii), that the bycatch
allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery category has been
reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by trawl vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear
in the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 6, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;675.20(h).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule was published in the July 12, 1994 issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 35487). The proposed rule would amend the definition of fresh fruit and vegetables set forth in 7 CFR 46.2(u)
of the Regulations issued pursuant to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499o). This document
extends PACA coverage to include frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, especially frozen french fried
potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of these commodities suffered considerable financial
losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the PACA. Reopening the comment period grants dealers in
frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose frozen product is water blanched.

On August 10, 1994, the Agency received a request from the Food Marketing Institute, International Foodservice Distributors
Association, National-American Wholesale Grocers Association, National Council of Chain Restaurants, National
Grocers Association, and the National Restaurant Association requesting a 90-day extension of the comment period.
The request stated they needed additional time to develop their comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that a 30-day extension of the comment period will provide adequate time for interested
persons to respond to this proposed rule. Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to October 12, 1994.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 27, 1992, Learjet Inc. (Lear), 8220 West Harry Street, Wichita, KS 67209&hyph;2942, P.O. Box 7707, Wichita,
KS 67277&hyph;7707, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 45 airplane.
The Learjet Model 45 is a T-tail, low wing, medium sized business jet powered by two Garrett TFE 731&hyph;20 turbofan
engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine is capable of delivering 3,500 lbs. thrust
(3,650 lbs. thrust with auto performance reserve). The airplane is capable of operating with two flight crewmembers
and a maximum of ten passengers (standard is eight passengers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Type Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.17 of the FAR, Learjet must show, except as provided in &sect;25.2, that the Model
45 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through
25&hyph;75. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 45 includes part 34, effective September
10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended
by Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions form
an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special
conditions that are not relevant to these special conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Learjet Model 45 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Novel or Unusual Design Features
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Model 45 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including primary flight displays, an electronically
controlled braking system, digital electronic engine controls, an engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS),
multifunction display, and a digital autopilot/flight director system. These systems may be vulnerable to lightning
and high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable
level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically
pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general (&sect;25.581), and the other for fuel system protection
(&sect;25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protecton of electrical and electronic
systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued
safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe
flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems
from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are needed for the Lear Model 45, which require that new technology electrical and electronic
systems be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to both the direct
and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Lightning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide a means of compliance with these special conditions, clarification of the threat definition of lightning
is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, Protection of Aircraft
Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed as a basis
to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception of the multiple
burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20&hyph;53A,
will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning
on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the
airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding,
airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, tests (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation)
and/or verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems.
The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility
to upset and/or malfunction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Return Stroke:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant
internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment
``hardness'' level.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple Stroke Flash: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple
strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary
factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of
time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets
over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing
and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system
response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described
as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of
50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints:
(1) the minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms.
An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system
under evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple Burst: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Component H). In-flight data gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise,
short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in
these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset
to some digital processing systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak
rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight
data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of
the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order
to be used. This ``Multiple Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component
H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds,
the maximum is 1,000 microseconds. The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum
period between bursts in 30ms, and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst''
Component H waveform is defined below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple
Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These components are defined by the following double exponential equation:

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems to HIRF must be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy
to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis
of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special
condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.

that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected
when the airplane is exposed to lightning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each essential function of electrical or electronic systems or installations must be protected to ensure that
the function can be recovered in a timely manner after the airplane has been exposed to lightning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Protection from Unwanted Effects of High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure
that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected
when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes special conditions for the Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna), Model 750 (Citation X) airplane.
This new airplane will utilize new avionics/electronic systems that provide critical data to the flightcrew. The
applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems
from the effects of lightning and high-intensity radiated fields. These proposed special conditions contain the
additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent
to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 29, 1994, the FAA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 14571) proposed special conditions for the Cessna Model 750 (Citation X). These special conditions are proposed
requirements to protect the airplane systems from the effects of lightning and high intensity radiated fields (HIRF).
Cessna, commenting to the docket by letter, noted that there were differences in the preamble language from the language
used in issue papers that discussed the proposed method of compliance with these special conditions. The FAA agrees.
Although the special conditions proposed herein have not changed from the original notice, the methods of compliance
discussed in the issue papers that preceded the original notice were in fact different in certain respects than the
methods of compliance discussed in the original notice. The FAA inadvertently left out Cessna's proposed alternate
methods of complying with the proposed special conditions. As the methods of compliance proposed by Cessna deviate
in certain respects from previous methods of compliance with the proposed special conditions, the FAA agrees these
methods should also be made available for the public record and comment as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 15, 1991, Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna), 6030 Cessna Blvd., P.O. Box 7704, Wichita, KS 67277&hyph;7704,
applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model 750 (Citation X) airplane. The
Cessna Model 750 is a T-tail, low swept wing, medium-sized business jet powered by two GMA&hyph;3007C turbofan engines
mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 6,000 pounds thrust.
The flight controls will be powered and capable of manual reversion. The airplane has a seating capacity of up to twelve
passengers, and a maximum takeoff weight of 31,000 pounds.

Type Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.17 of the FAR, Cessna must show, except as provided in &sect;25.2, that the Model
750 (Citation X) meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1
through 25&hyph;74. In addition, the proposed certification basis for the Model 750 includes part 34, effective
September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1,
1969, as amended by Amendment 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. No exemptions
are anticipated. The special conditions that may be developed as a result of this notice will form an additional part
of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that
are not relevant to these proposed special conditions.

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Cessna Model 750 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special
conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established
in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2).

Novel or Unusual Design Features
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Model 750 incorporates new avionic/electronic installations, including a digital Electronic Flight Instrument
System (EFIS), Air Data System, Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), Navigation and Communication System,
Autopilot System, and a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system that controls critical engine parameters.
These systems may be vulnerable to lightning and high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing lightning protection airworthiness certification requirements are insufficient to provide an acceptable
level of safety with new technology avionic and electronic systems. There are two regulations that specifically
pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general (&sect;25.581), and the other for fuel system protection
(&sect;25.954). There are, however, no regulations that deal specifically with protection of electrical and electronic
systems from lightning. The loss of a critical function of these systems due to lightning would prevent continued
safe flight and landing of the airplane. Although the loss of an essential function would not prevent continued safe
flight and landing, it could significantly impact the safety level of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems
from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground based radio transmitters and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are proposed for the Cessna Model 750, which would require that new technology electrical and
electronic systems, such as the EFIS, FADEC, AHRS, etc., be designed and installed to preclude component damage and
interruption of function due to both the direct and indirect effects of lightning and HIRF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Lightning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide a means of compliance with these proposed special conditions, clarification of the threat definition
of lightning is needed. The following ``threat definition,'' based on FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, Protection
of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning, dated March 5, 1990, is proposed
as a basis to use in demonstrating compliance with the lightning protection special condition, with the exception
of the multiple burst environment, which has been changed to agree with the latest recommendation from the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AE4L lightning committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lightning current waveforms (Components A, D, and H) defined below, along with the voltage waveforms in AC 20&hyph;53A,
will provide a consistent and reasonable standard that is acceptable for use in evaluating the effects of lightning
on the airplane. These waveforms depict threats that are external to the airplane. The effect of these threats on the
airplane and its systems depends upon several factors, including installation configuration, materials, shielding,
airplane geometry, etc. Therefore, tests (including tests on the completed airplane or an adequate simulation)
and/or verified analyses need to be conducted in order to obtain the resultant internal threat to the installed systems.
The electronic systems may then be evaluated with this internal threat in order to determine their susceptibility
to upset and/or malfunction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To evaluate the induced effects to these systems, three considerations are required:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Return Stroke:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Severe Strike_Component A, or Restrike-Component D). This external threat needs to be evaluated to obtain the resultant
internal threat and to verify that the level of the induced currents and voltages is sufficiently below the equipment
``hardness'' level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple Stroke Flash:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1/2 Component D). A lightning strike is often composed of a number of successive strokes, referred to as multiple
strokes. Although multiple strokes are not necessarily a salient factor in a damage assessment, they can be the primary
factor in a system upset analysis. Multiple strokes can induce a sequence of transients over an extended period of
time. While a single event upset of input/output signals may not affect system performance, multiple signal upsets
over an extended period of time (2 seconds) may affect the systems under consideration. Repetitive pulse testing
and/or analysis needs to be carried out in response to the multiple stroke environment to demonstrate that the system
response meets the safety objective. This external multiple stroke environment consists of 24 pulses and is described
as a single Component A followed by 23 randomly spaced restrikes of 1/2 magnitude of Component D (peak amplitude of
50,000 amps). The 23 restrikes are distributed over a period of up to 2 seconds according to the following constraints:
(1) the minimum time between subsequent strokes is 10ms, and (2) the maximum time between subsequent strokes is 200ms.
An analysis or test needs to be accomplished in order to obtain the resultant internal threat environment for the system
under evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple Burst:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Component H). In-flight data-gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise,
short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in
these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset
to some digital processing systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak
rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight
data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of
the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order
to be used. This ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum
time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds, the maximum is 1,000 microseconds.
The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum period between bursts is 30ms,
and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst'' Component H waveform is defined
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple
Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These components are defined by the following double exponential equation:

It is Cessna's position that only damage tolerance testing of equipment that performs essential functions should
be required using the procedures and conditions specified in DO&hyph;160C, Section 22 (change 2). Pin injection
or cable bundle testing would be required, but there should be no multi-strike or multi-burst requirement. Cessna
proposes that to evaluate the induced effects of lightning to the systems under consideration, the following must
be considered:

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the trend toward increased power levels from ground based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems to HIRF must be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling of electromagnetic energy
to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis
of existing HIRF emitters, the FAA has used criteria for compliance with the HIRF protection special condition shown
in paragraphs 1 or 2 below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A mininum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.

Cessna's market for the Model 750 Citation X includes, at the present time, two European JAA member countries. Consequently,
Cessna intends to pursue certification to meet the European JAA requirements as well as the FAA requirements. To reduce
the testing required, Cessna proposes to test to an environment that combines a proposed FAA certification environment
(from the SAE AE4R Subcommittee) and a proposed JAA certification environment (from EUROCAE WG&hyph;33) to form
a ``worst case'' certification environment. This environment will consist of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the combined proposed certification environment is less than 100 volts per meter, Cessna will test to the proposed
certification environment (JAA or FAA, whichever is higher). Where the combined environment is greater than 100
volts per meter, Cessna will test to the proposed JAA environment (less aircraft attenuation above 200 MHz). The aircraft
attenuation will be established by the results of full vehicle tests conducted by Cessna on Model 650, Citation III,
and Citation VII aircraft. Cessna's proposed Model 750 HIRF certification environment is as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the on-going regulatory review of its rules and guides, the Commission on May 6, 1994 published requests
for public comments concerning three related sets of regulations: (1) Rules and Regulations under the Wool Products
Labeling Act, (2) Rules and Regulations under the Fur Products Labeling Act, and (3) Rules and Regulations under the
Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. The comments were to be accepted until June 6, 1994. The Commission subsequently
extended the comment period until September 6, 1994.

The Commission has received a letter seeking extension of these comment periods from the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute, a trade association representing large numbers of interested members subject to the marking requirements
of the Textile, Wool, and Fur Acts. In addition to this formal request for extension, Commission staff has been contacted
by other trade associations and interested entities who intend to comment or would like to comment and have stated
that, because of the widespread coverage and complexity of these regulations, the comment periods should be extended.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Washington for
the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the Vancouver Air Quality
Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound Ozone Nonattainment Area. The SIP revision was submitted by the State
to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Washington
State. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action proposes standards of performance for wastewater sources in the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing
Industry (SOCMI). These standards implement section 111 of the Clean Air Act (the ACT) and are based on the Administrator's
determination that VOC emissions from SOCMI cause, or contribute significantly to, air pollution that may reasonably
be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The intended effect of these standards is to require all new,
modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units to control wastewater emissions to the level achievable by the best
demonstrated system of continuous emission reduction, considering costs, nonair quality health, environmental,
and energy impacts, not just with end-of-pipe and add-on controls, but also by eliminating or reducing the formation
of these pollutants. The proposed regulation would achieve an estimated reduction of 16,200 megagrams (Mg) of VOC
in the fifth year following promulgation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. New Source Performance Standards_General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New source performance standards (NSPS) implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 111 of the Act. The NSPS are issued for categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sources that cause, or contribute significantly to, air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health or welfare. They apply to new stationary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources of emissions, i.e., sources whose construction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconstruction, or modification begins after a standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them is proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An NSPS requires these sources to control emissions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the level achievable by ``best demonstrated technology,'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``BDT.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. NSPS Decision Scheme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An NSPS is the product of a series of decisions made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during development of the regulation. Elements in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``decision scheme'' include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Source category to be regulated: usually an entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, but can be a process or group of processes within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Pollutant(s) to be regulated: the particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance(s) emitted by the source that the standard will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Best demonstrated technology: the technology on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Agency will base the standards, as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 111(a)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Affected facility: the pieces or groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that comprise the sources to which the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Emission points to be regulated: within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected facility, the specific physical location emitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants (e.g., vents, equipment leaks, and wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Format for the standards: the form in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are expressed, i.e., as a percent reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, as pollutant concentration, or as equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Standards: based on what BDT can achieve, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum permissible emissions, or design, equipment, work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice, or operational requirements if emission limits are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infeasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Other considerations: in addition, NSPS usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include modification/reconstruction considerations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements, performance test methods, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

II. Summary of the Proposed NSPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Source Category To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volatile organic compound emissions from SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater (also referred to as ``secondary sources'') are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being regulated under section 111 of the Act. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards would regulate VOC emissions from wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by SOCMI process units and are limited to emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points in the associated process unit's wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and treatment systems. Specific emission points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are discussed in section II.E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastewater is water that comes in contact with process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluids during manufacturing, processing, or maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations within a process unit at a SOCMI facility. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters contain relatively low concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants (e.g., less than 2 percent or 20,000 parts per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million (ppm)) and are managed in wastewater collection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment systems. Wastewater collection and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems typically include individual drain systems, oil- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water separators, air flotation units, equalization tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and biological treatments units. Volatile organic compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are emitted from the wastewater during collection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations targeting emissions from SOCMI wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been developed previously. National emission standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for benzene waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations (40 CFR part 61, subpart FF) regulate benzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from SOCMI waste streams that contain benzene at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of 10 parts per million by weight (ppmw) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more at facilities that handle at least 10 Mg/yr of benzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in certain wastes. A second regulation, the hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic NESHAP (``the HON'') in subpart G of 40 CFR part 63, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is broader in scope, regulating emissions of many organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from SOCMI wastewater. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON imposes standards on SOCMI process wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from process units that produce any of a selected group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products at facilities that are major sources under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule covers individual waste streams that contain one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more of the HAP identified in section 112(b) of the Act at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations above specified levels. Generally, a SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source subject to the benzene waste NESHAP would also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the HON.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A third regulation that may affect the chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(RCRA) air emission standards for hazardous waste treatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, and disposal facilities. That rule will establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for controlling emissions from wastes that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as hazardous under RCRA at facilities subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtitle C permitting requirements. Under that rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous wastes would have to be managed in controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units until the waste is treated to remove or destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain hazardous components. The rule only applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units and facilities that are permitted under RCRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtitle C. However, under RCRA, wastewater treatment units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not subject to subtitle C hazardous waste management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards provided the unit is part of a wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment facility that is subject to regulation under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either section 402 or 307(b) of the Clean Water Act. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste tank systems that are used to store or treat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater that is managed at an on-site wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment facility with a National Pollution Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elimination System permit or that discharges to a publicly- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owned treatment works would generally be exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the HON, the benzene waste NESHAP, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RCRA air standards, section 182(b)(2) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that State implementation plans (SIP's) for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone nonattainment areas be revised to require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of reasonably available control technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(RACT) for control of VOC emissions. The EPA has defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RACT generally as the lowest emission limitation that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular source is capable of meeting by the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of control technology that is reasonably available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering technological and economic feasibility. In some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, the EPA has, or will, issue guidance relative to RACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the form of a control techniques guidelines (CTG) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. A draft of the Industrial Wastewater (IWW) CTG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was released for public comment on December 29, 1993. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI is a subset of the industry group which is covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the IWW CTG. The CTG is intended to provide State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air pollution authorities with an information base for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding with their own analysis of RACT to meet statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Due to time and budget constraints, the IWW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CTG has not been finalized. An alternative control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology (ACT) document has been prepared and provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States as interim guidance to aid in development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules in the absence of the final IWW CTG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In spite of the guidance and the three separate rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to regulate emissions from wastewater streams at SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, there are substantial gaps in the extent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which these rules control emissions from SOCMI wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams with the potential to emit VOC. The HON applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only a segment of the industry that produces a specified set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of products, which does not include all SOCMI installations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the HON only regulates streams that contain HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at concentrations above a trigger level. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON does not regulate wastewater streams that emit VOC that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not HAP. The benzene waste NESHAP applies to all SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installations but is very limited in scope regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste streams regulated, i.e., only those streams that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain benzene are subject to the rule. Many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams at SOCMI plants do not contain benzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but do contain other VOC that are emitted to the atmosphere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if left uncontrolled. The RCRA air standards for hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste toxic storage and disposal facilities are not expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to impact a significant number of wastewater streams at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI plants because of the wastewater exemption under RCRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA analysis of SOCMI wastewater data submitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry shows a significant number of wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by SOCMI process units will not be regulated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HON or other wastewater related rules. This is in large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part a result of the fact that the source category coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the SOCMI Wastewater NSPS is considerably broader than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of the HON. For example, the chemical list defining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the affected SOCMI process units is nearly twice as large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the NSPS as for the HON. For many of the SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries, VOC-containing wastewater streams do not contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP and therefore controlling only HAP-containing streams, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as is required under the HON, would not substantially reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions. It is estimated that 68 percent of all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI chemical production process units will have wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams that would require control under the proposed NSPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but will not require control under the HON. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NSPS for SOCMI wastewater sources is needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fill the gaps in the coverage of VOC emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams left uncovered by other regulations. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the benzene waste NESHAP and the RCRA air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are risk-based standards. Risk-based standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are designed to reduce emissions to a level that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect human health and the environment with an ample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margin of safety. The goal of an NSPS, on the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to improve ambient air quality over time by application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of best demonstrated technology (BDT) on all new, modified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reconstructed sources. The goal of the CTG is to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance to States in revising their SIP's and to help bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their nonattainment areas into compliance with the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ambient Air Quality Standards. The SIP rules do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at facilities that are in ozone attainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, NSPS require installation of BDT rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RACT, which in some cases may achieve a higher level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction. The NSPS would impose consistent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide regulatory requirements, which would ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste streams and wastewater streams at all new, modified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reconstructed SOCMI process units are controlled in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent manner using the best emission controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, although a portion of waste streams and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams at SOCMI sites are already controlled as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result of existing and planned regulations, none of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations cover all SOCMI waste streams with the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to emit VOC. These other regulations are limited in scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and leave some wastewater streams uncontrolled for air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. These uncontrolled wastewater streams are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject of the NSPS for SOCMI wastewater sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that there may be some overlap among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those regulations affecting wastes and wastewater at SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, leading to possibly duplicative requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid the burden of such duplication, the EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing in the SOCMI NSPS that the owner or operator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste management units, treatment processes, or control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices affected by the proposed rule may comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control requirements of the proposed rule by demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the benzene waste operations NESHAP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON, or the RCRA air emission standards for hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. The owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would also be required to maintain records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documenting which regulation is being used to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the proposed NSPS. An owner or operator who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses to demonstrate compliance in this manner would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempted from the inspection, monitoring, reporting, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements of the proposed rule that relate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the affected waste management unit, treatment process, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device. The Agency is soliciting comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed approach to reducing the regulatory burden for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sources. In addition, the Agency is interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving information on the level of burden that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed by the possible duplication of requirements.

B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air pollutant to be regulated by these standards is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC. The primary air pollutant from SOCMI wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities is VOC, which is a precursor to the formation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ozone and oxygenated organic aerosols. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Best Demonstrated Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 111 of the Act states that NSPS ``shall reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the degree of emission limitation and the percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction achievable through application of the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological system of continuous emission reduction which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(taking into consideration the cost of achieving such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction, any nonair quality health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impact and energy requirements) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology basis for NSPS that meets these criteria is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as ``best demonstrated technology (BDT).'' In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards development process for NSPS, BDT should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified, the performance of BDT established, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative selected that will require the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BDT or an equivalent technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volatile organic compound emissions from wastewater can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be effectively reduced with the following control approach: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify wastewater streams with significant VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission potential; (2) recycle or treat those wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams to remove their potential for emissions; (3) prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treatment or recycling, manage those waste streams in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units equipped with air emission controls; (4) recycle any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment residuals or treat any residuals to destroy the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC; and (5) control air emissions generated by treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment technology that is the basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards for wastewater is steam stripping, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proven treatment technology for wastewaters generated within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the targeted industry. It is generally applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams with the potential to emit VOC and, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, achieves the highest VOC emission reduction among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated VOC control technologies. Facilities can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply by installing the design steam stripper or by installing a stripper or other treatment device that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieves an equivalent VOC emission reduction. Control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air emissions from the stripper and from treatment residuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also required. Although standards for wastewater are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the performance of steam stripping, other treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies such as biodegradation have also been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated to be effective. To be considered equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to steam stripping, a properly operated biological treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit must achieve a 95-percent VOC reduction or meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required mass removal while controlling air emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biodegradation may also be used as one of a series of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment processes (e.g., a steam stripper followed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological treatment unit) where the combination achieves a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of 99 percent or more in volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. Alternative treatment technologies other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than biodegradation are permitted if their performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equals or exceeds that of steam stripping, i.e., a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
99-percent VOC reduction.

D. Affected Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the SOCMI wastewater NSPS, the affected facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be each new process unit (and the wastewater streams it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generates) at a SOCMI plant. A SOCMI process unit will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as one producing one or more of the chemicals listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulation. A process unit at a SOCMI plant will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be new if construction, modification, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconstruction of the unit commences after the date the NSPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Emission Points to be Regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air emission points selected for the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations include all significant points in SOCMI process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit wastewater collection and treatment systems that manage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or maintenance wastewater streams or residuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from SOCMI process units that produce any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed chemicals. The air emission release points in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process unit wastewater collection and treatment system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include individual drain systems, which are comprised of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment such as open trenches, drains, manholes, junction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boxes, lift stations, and weirs; surface impoundments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater storage and treatment tanks; oil-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separators; containers; clarifiers; and biological treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units. At these release points, VOC can be transferred from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process unit wastewater stream to the air.

F. Format for the Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As authorized under section 111 of the Act, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards consist of a combination of emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and equipment, design, and work practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Emission standards are used whenever feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, such standards are not feasible in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. In some cases, alternative emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are also proposed. Separate standards for tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface impoundments, containers, individual drain systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil-water separators, treatment processes, and control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices are proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed standards, SOCMI process unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams with a volatile organic concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(measured using Reference Method 25D, 40 CFR part 60, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A) greater than or equal to 500 ppmw and flow rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than or equal to 1.0 liter per minute (Lpm) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be controlled. In addition, any wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream with a volatile organic concentration greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10,000 ppmw would be controlled under the regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of flow rate. Process units that generate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater with a total annual volatile organic mass of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1 Mg are exempt from the wastewater control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed wastewater treatment standard involves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of a controlled collection and treatment system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to individual wastewater streams that fail the cut off 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. The treatment requirements are designed to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VOC content in the wastewater prior to placement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units without air emission controls. The proposal includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a variety of compliance options in order to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment process standard. These include a recycling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option involving recycling of the wastewater to a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit, an equipment design and operation standard, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical emission standard formatted as an effluent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration limit, and a numerical emission standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
format in terms a mass removal requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to treatment, the wastewater must be managed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units equipped with air emission controls, and wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and treatment systems must be designed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated without leaks, as defined in the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following is a summary of the specific standards for each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual types of SOCMI wastewater units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Standards for Tanks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed standards, owners and operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required, with two exceptions, to place wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams in one of the following types of tanks depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tank capacity and vapor pressure of the stored material: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A tank equipped with a cover (e.g., a fixed roof) and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed vent system and control device that meets certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, inspection, and measurement specifications specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the rules; (2) a tank equipped with a fixed roof and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal floating roof that meets the design requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified under the existing volatile organic liquid (VOL) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage NSPS (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb); (3) a tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with an external floating roof that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, inspection, and measurement requirements specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the existing VOL storage NSPS; or (4) a pressure tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is designed and operated with no pressure releases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during normal operations including waste loading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unloading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules would provide two exceptions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank control requirements described above. First, when an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected stream (i.e., one in which the wastewater has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass-weighted average volatile organic concentration equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to or greater than 500 ppmw) is managed in certain size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks and possesses certain vapor pressure characteristics, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an owner or operator would be allowed to place the waste in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a tank equipped with a fixed roof. Second, when the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is placed in a biological treatment tank that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological organic degradation performance requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., 95-percent destruction efficiency), no additional air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission controls would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each cover opening not vented to a control device would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be required to be maintained in a closed, sealed position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except at those times when a specific opening is used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
add, remove, inspect, or sample the waste in the tank or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspect, maintain, repair, or replace equipment located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underneath the cover. Safety devices that vent directly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the atmosphere could be used on the cover or closedvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system with control device provided that the safety device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not used for planned or routine venting of organic vapors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the safety device remains in a closed, sealed position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at all times except when an unplanned event requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opening of the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Standards for Surface Impoundments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner or operator of an affected surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment is required to install and use emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. The proposed rules would require owners or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators to place waste in a surface impoundment equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a cover (e.g., air-supported structure) and a closed- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vent system with control device or, when applicable, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface impoundment equipped with a floating membrane cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the air emission control. If the surface impoundment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for biological treatment that meets the same organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biodegradation performance requirements described above for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, no additional air emission controls would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used on the surface impoundment. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating and venting requirements for surface impoundment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air emission control equipment are consistent with the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Standards for Containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would not apply to a container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 cubic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meter (m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (26.4 gallons (gal)). The owner or operator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an affected container would be required to place the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material either into a container equipped with a cover that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operates with no detectable organic emissions when all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
openings are secured in a closed, sealed position or to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the alternative requirements discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative requirements under the proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a drum with a design capacity less than or equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.42 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (110 gal) would allow an owner or operator to place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste in a drum meeting the Department of Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DOT) specifications and testing requirements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR part 178. For a drum meeting these DOT regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, nor recordkeeping of cover design documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required under the proposed standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative for containers under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards would require the owner or operator of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container that attaches to or forms a part of any truck, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trailer, or rail car to show that the container has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested for organic vapor tightness within the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 months in accordance with the requirements of Method 27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Method 27 is a pressure test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure originally developed by the EPA for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vapor-leak tightness of a tank truck into which gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is placed. The EPA also considers the use of Method 27 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriate for determining vapor-leak tightness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trucks, trailers, and rail cars into which wastes containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organics are placed. Neither Method 21, leak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, nor recordkeeping of cover design documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required for trucks, trailers, or rail cars complying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this provision of the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a waste is loaded into a container by pumping, the proposed standards would require submerged fill of waste only
into those containers with a capacity equal to or greater than 0.42 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (110 gal). Accordingly, drums with design capacities up to and including 0.42 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (110 gal) are not required to be loaded by submerged fill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it is necessary for a container to be open during certain treatment processes, the proposed standards would require
the container to be located in an enclosure connected to a closed-vent system with control device. The enclosure would
be required to be designed to operate with sufficient airflow into the structure to capture all organic vapors vented
from the container and route the vapors through the closed-vent system to the control device. The enclosure could
have permanent or temporary openings to allow worker access, passage of containers through the enclosure by conveyor
or other mechanical means, or entry of permanent mechanical or electrical equipment, or to direct airflow into the
enclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Standards for Individual Drain Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require individual drain systems to meet one of two standards. In the first case, the owner
or operator would comply by operating and maintaining on each opening in the individual drain system a cover and closed-vent
system. The covers and all openings and the closed-vent system would meet the leak detection requirements, unless
the system is operated and maintained under negative pressure. The cover and all openings would be maintained in a
closed, sealed position at all times when affected wastewater or residual is in the system except when it is necessary
to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair. Each individual
drain system would be subject to initial and semi-annual inspections for improper work practices and control equipment
failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, individual drain system components would be required to comply with equipment standards. Each drain
would be equipped with water seal controls or a tightly sealed cap or plug to eliminate air flow through the system.
Each junction box would be equipped with a cover and emission controls. Each sewer line would be covered or enclosed
in a manner so as to have no visible gaps or crack in joints, seals, or other emission interfaces. This equipment would
be subject to regular inspection requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Standards for Oil-Water Separators
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would require owners or operators to operate and maintain either a fixed roof and closed-vent
system that routes the VOC vapors from the oil-water separator to a control device or a floating roof. The fixed roof
and all openings and the closed-vent system would be maintained in accordance with the leak detection requirements
of the proposed rule, unless the system is operated and maintained under negative pressure. As with standards for
other waste management units, each opening would be maintained in a closed, sealed position except when it is necessary
to use the opening for sampling or removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except in cases where it is impossible to operate a floating roof, such as over the weir mechanisms, the owner or operator
would have the option of using a floating roof that meets the requirements of subpart QQQ of 40 CFR part 60. The owner
or operator would measure primary and secondary seal gaps on a periodic basis as well as inspect the oil-water separator
for improper work practices and control equipment failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Standards for Treatment Processes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner or operator would be required to treat each affected wastewater or residual stream by one of the following
methods:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recycle or return to a production process such that the wastewater stream or residual is not exposed to the atmosphere
and ensure that intervening waste management units meet the applicable requirements of the standards;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Treat using a waste management unit that either is a design steam stripper, reduces by 99 percent or more the total
volatile organic mass flow rate, reduces the average volatile organic concentration to less than 50 ppmw and reduces
the total volatile organic mass by 95 percent, or achieves a required volatile organic mass removal rate for combined
or mixed streams; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Treat wastewater streams generated by an affected process unit with a biological treatment unit that achieves
95 percent total volatile organic mass removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the treatment process or waste management unit is a properly operated biological treatment unit that meets the
mass removal (i.e., biodegradation) requirements, the biological treatment unit need not be covered and vented
to a control device. However, the owner or operator of any other treatment process or waste management unit subject
to the applicable standards (for example, if the treatment process is a steam stripper, air stripper, or thin-film
evaporation unit) would be required to cover and vent the unit through a closed-vent system to a control device and
meet the leak detection requirements, unless the cover and vent are operated and maintained under negative pressure.
In addition, any openings must be kept closed at all times that an affected wastewater stream or treatment residual
is in the process or unit, except during inspection and maintenance and unless the unit is a properly operated biological
treatment unit as defined by the standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each treatment process or waste management unit used to comply with the treatment processes standards would be required
to provide a design analysis and supporting documentation of the operating characteristics of the treatment process
or waste management unit that is based on operation at a representative wastewater stream flow rate and volatile organic
concentration under which it would be most difficult to demonstrate compliance (i.e., when air emissions are expected
to be highest). Alternatively, the owner or operator may conduct performance tests using the test methods and procedures
specified in the proposed rules to demonstrate compliance. In addition, all openings are subject to periodic inspection
and repair schedules and monitoring requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provides several exceptions to the standards for treatment processes. The owner or operator is
considered to be in compliance with the treatment requirements and is exempt from the demonstration that the treatment
process achieves the required conditions if the treatment process is one of the following: (1) A hazardous waste incinerator
for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 70 and 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or (2)
an industrial furnace or boiler burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit
under 40 CFR part 270 and 40 CFR part 266, subpart H or has certified compliance with the interim status requirements
of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H. In addition, if the affected wastewater stream or residual is discharged to an underground
injection well for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and 40 CFR part 122,
the owner is considered in compliance with the treatment provisions.

7. Standards for Control Devices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards would require that each control device achieve at least a 95-percent reduction in the total
organic content of the vapor stream vented to the device or, in the case of an enclosed combustion device, a reduction
of the total organic content of the vapor stream to a level less than or equal to 20 ppmw on a dry basis, corrected to 3 percent
oxygen, or provide a minimum residence time and temperature as specified in the proposed standards. Flares would
be required to comply with the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart A. With certain exceptions (e.g., some boilers
and process heaters and flares), compliance would either be demonstrated through a design analysis that addresses
vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters or performance tests would be conducted using
the methods and procedures specified in the proposed rules. In addition, each control device is subject to the enhanced
monitoring and continued compliance requirements of section 114(a) of the CAAA, as well as to periodic inspection
and specified repair periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards would not require the use of any specific type of equipment or add-on control device. An owner or operator
would be allowed the flexibility of choosing the control device that can achieve the performance requirements and
is best suited for a control application based on the types and characteristics of the particular organic vapor stream.
Furthermore, the standards would not require that each affected waste management unit be vented to a separate control
device dedicated to that particular unit. Vent streams from several units can be combined and discharged to a single
control device that achieves the required level of performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Modification and Reconstruction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions of the proposed standards would apply to existing facilities that are modified or reconstructed after
the date of proposal. It is possible that at some facilities, feedstock, catalyst, or reactant substitutions; process
equipment changes; or combinations of these two classes of changes above could trigger the part 60 General Provisions
related to modification or reconstruction of facilities. Changes of this nature are likely to require both equipment
and process changes as well as significant capital expenditures. See section IV.H for a more detailed discussion
of these considerations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Compliance Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Test methods and procedures would be required to ensure compliance with the standards proposed for SOCMI wastewater
sources. The proposed standards include requirements for demonstrating that an emission point or wastewater stream
is being controlled in compliance with control requirements or would not be required to be controlled. Also included
are provisions for an initial test for no detectable emissions (i.e., leaks as defined in the standards) from tanks,
containers, surface impoundments, closed-vent systems, and process wastewater collection and treatment systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Test methods are provided for use by the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator in determining applicability of the standards to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given wastewater stream. The three variables of concern, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual wastewater quantity, average total volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, and annual average wastewater flow rate, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined using a variety of methods. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards include provisions that would allow a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI process unit owner or operator to use either direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement or knowledge of the wastewater to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration of the wastewater. Direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements would be conducted in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Method 25D in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Knowledge of the wastewater can be demonstrated by material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balances, records of chemical purchases, process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stoichiometry, or previous test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination of the volatile organic concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or average annual flow rate of a wastewater would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the proposed standards only when a wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the standards is placed in a waste management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit that is not equipped with air emission controls in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the rules. The SOCMI process unit owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would not be required to determine the volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic concentration or average annual flow rate of wastewater streams that are managed only in units equipped with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standard up to the point of ultimate recycle, disposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that emission control equipment is properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated and maintained, the proposed standards would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner or operator to inspect and monitor certain air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control equipment used to comply with the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced monitoring of control device operation is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the proposed standards to demonstrate compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. This involves the use of automated instrumentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to measure critical operating parameters that indicate whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control device is operating correctly or is malfunctioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to maintain the established values of the monitored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the enhanced monitoring requirements, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial leak detection test using Method 21 under appendix A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60 is required for certain cover components to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight.
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 21 test would be supplemented by annual visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections for leaking components as well as periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and measurement of other monitoring parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special inspection and monitoring provisions are included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed standards for cover fittings that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor. Leak monitoring using Method 21 is not required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the following: (1) Drums that meet applicable DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations specified in the rules; (2) trucks, trailers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and rail cars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tight by Method 27 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) closed-vent systems operated under vacuum conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Reporting and Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards require the owner or operator to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record certain information in the on-site facility operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logs or files. The information to be collected and recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes: the results of all waste determinations such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration at the point of waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation and organic vapor pressure; design specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for closed-vent systems and control devices and control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment; emission control equipment inspection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring results; Method 21 and Method 27 test results; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device monitoring results; leak repairs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of incinerators, boilers, or industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnaces in which wastewater is treated in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general requirements of the rule; documentation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological wastewater treatment units complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule; and identification of equipment designated as unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or difficult to monitor or inspect. This information is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be readily available for review by authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives of the EPA. The EPA seeks comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessibility of the monitoring data and periodic reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may be kept in logs on the plant site when it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be reported to the appropriate agency. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data and reports should be accessible to citizen groups that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplate citizen suits or other members of the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in the source's compliance status. This access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required by section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amended (CAAA). Means of providing that accessibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include: direct inspection of the logs or files on-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with authority to access the data equal to that of the EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA with an affirmative duty on the part of the EPA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state/local delegated agent to obtain any data from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source that the agency does not have in its files, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of a FOIA-like request to the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner/operator with an obligation on the part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner/operator to provide the requested data, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to keep electronic files/logs which would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessible through EPA electronic bulletin boards. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions for meeting the mandates of section 114 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welcome.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Provisions of 40 CFR part 60 require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner or operator to submit certain notifications and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to the Administrator. Section 60.7(a)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Provisions requires a notification of the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction or reconstruction of an affected facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenced; the proposed rule requires that certain general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regarding the wastewater generated by the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be submitted with this notification. Section 60.7(a)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the General Provisions requires a notification of the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of initial startup of an affected facility; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule requires that the owner or operator provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this notification more detailed information and data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewater streams generated by the affected process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. This information includes a determination of whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stream is an affected wastewater stream, the compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach utilized if the stream is being controlled in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the requirements of &sect;60.109(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, the identification of the waste management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units receiving or managing each affected wastewater stream, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and certain information on the treatment processes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control devices used to comply with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 60.7(c) of the General Provisions requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each owner or operator required to install a continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring system (CMS) or monitoring device submit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or a summary report to the Administrator on a quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis when the CMS data are to be used directly for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance determination, as is the case for control devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this proposed rule. In order to be consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements of the HON, which also regulates this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, the EPA is exempting the owner or operator from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quarterly reporting requirement and is requiring only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semiannual report in the proposed rule. The semiannual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report will contain information on the excursions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceedances as determined by the CMS data, performance test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results, and other information on treatment processes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Impacts of the Proposed NSPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To estimate the impacts of the proposed regulation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates the quantity of VOC that the affected industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would emit to the atmosphere in the absence of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This estimated quantity serves as a baseline from which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of the rule are measured. Following estimation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the baseline level of emissions, the Agency estimates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reduction that would occur as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives for the rule. Studies are then made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to estimate the impacts of the rule on the environment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economics of the industry and the nation, and on energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption. Collectively, these estimates represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of the standard. Estimated impacts include emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions, costs, impacts on non-air environmental media, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and energy usage. The impacts presented here are those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to occur in the fifth year after promulgation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the impacts are calculated as an increment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the impacts of the wastewater rules included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HON. Additional details of the impacts analysis can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the BID and from documentation developed in support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HON. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed NSPS, it is estimated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68 percent of all new SOCMI chemical production process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units would have wastewater streams that require control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the NSPS but do not require control under the HON. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is further estimated that the total annual emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction achieved by the NSPS in the fifth year would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 16,200 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) of VOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the NSPS requires the treatment of wastewater prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to discharge, there would be no negative impacts on water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality. In fact, the impacts of the rule on water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be positive. Impacts of the rule on solid waste are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be negligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other environmental impacts of the rule are estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be small. Due to the increased energy requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, emissions of carbon monoxide are estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase by about 4 Mg/yr and emissions of nitrogen oxides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are estimated to increase by about 35 Mg/yr. Energy impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule include the combustion of fossil fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to generate steam for steam stripping systems. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts are partially offset by the recovery of organics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the treatment system. Estimated energy impacts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule in the fifth year consist of an increase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.6 million kilowatt hours per year (Kw-hr/yr) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity usage, an increase in natural gas consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
133 million British thermal units per year (Btu/yr), and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in steam usage of 133 billion Btu/yr.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Cost Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fifth-year cost impacts of the proposed standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered to be reasonable. Total annualized cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule in the fifth year, on a nationwide basis, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated at $8.8 million. This results in a cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of about $540 per Mg of emission reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth-year national capital cost is estimated at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $5.8 million. The estimated cost impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume that most of the regulated SOCMI plants with affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process units have an existing steam stripping system with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient excess capacity to treat the wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated under the NSPS or will be able to modify steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stripping systems that are currently being designed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed for compliance with other regulations (e.g., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON) to add sufficient capacity to treat the wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams covered by the proposed NSPS that do not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control under these other regulations. The estimate also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that a small number (about 12 percent) do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an existing steam stripper and will have to install a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. These assumptions reflect the Agency's best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate of the way the industry will comply with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to pose significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse economic impacts. The impact estimates are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced assuming the costs of control are passed on to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer, as is the case in competitive markets in the long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
run. The EPA estimates, on average, a maximum price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase of less than 1 percent for SOCMI chemicals. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes the entire mix of chemicals produced by an affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI facility are proportionately affected by the NSPS, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that the chemicals produced at those SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities in the EPA database are reasonably representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the mix of chemicals in the industry. The market price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of specific chemicals may be greater than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average presented above. This may be especially true for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected chemicals produced in low volumes and affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that have lower-than-average market prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemicals with lower-than-average prices could experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher-than-average control costs per unit of revenue. Due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to economies of scale in pollution control, affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that are produced in low volumes are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a higher-than-average cost of control per unit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. The feature of the proposed rule that exempts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low volume wastewater streams from selected process units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may mitigate the price impact of low production volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that produce low volume waste streams. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there will be no adverse effects on industry employment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion because the proposed standards will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appreciably affect the demand for chemicals covered by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards.

IV. Rationale for Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 111(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator is required to publish, and periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
update, a list of source categories that in his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgement cause, or contribute significantly to, air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health or welfare. This list appears in 40 CFR 60.16 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ranks, in order of priority for standards development, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various source categories in terms of quantities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide pollutant emission, the mobility and competitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of each source category, and the extent to which each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutant endangers public health and welfare. The priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list reflects the Administrator's determination that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from the listed source categories contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, and it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to identify major source categories for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards of performance are to be promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The priority list ranks the SOCMI source category first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of 59 listed source categories. For regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, the SOCMI category was divided into the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segments: SOCMI unit processes; volatile organic liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VOL) storage vessels and handling equipment; SOCMI fugitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources; and SOCMI wastewater sources. Standards have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for the other three groups of SOCMI sources; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSPS proposes standards for the fourth and final category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This division of the source category on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar types of emission sources and applicable emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control techniques was chosen over a more traditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach for NSPS that involves the development of standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to each specific chemical process. The selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach is more resource efficient than the chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process approach because a large number of specific chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes can be covered by one regulation. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI plants contain similar wastewater emission sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarities in the behavior of wastewater emission sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in SOCMI allow the same control techniques to be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the processes. Therefore, because the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques can be applied to the entire industry group and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because regulating the entire group would be more resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient, a single regulation is being proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling wastewater emissions from the SOCMI source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SOCMI is a large and diverse industry producing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several thousand intermediate and end-product chemicals from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a small number of basic chemicals. Most of the chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by this industry fall under standard industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification code 286. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, a SOCMI process unit is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as one producing or using one or more of the chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in the regulation. The list of chemicals proposed is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an inclusive list that was derived from several sources that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also formed the basis for the initial list of chemicals used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to characterize SOCMI process units in the HON (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A of the HON BID, EPA&hyph;453/D&hyph;92&hyph;016). The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources are the basis for the composite list of chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the proposed NSPS: (1) ``Industrial Organic Chemical Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trees,'' EPA/ORD, October 1992; (2) Standards of Performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Equipment Leaks of VOC in SOCMI, 40 CFR part 60, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart VV; (3) Proposed Standards of Performance for SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reactor Processes, 55 FR 26953, June 29, 1990; (4) Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Performance for SOCMI Distillation Operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60, subpart NNN; and (5) Standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance for SOCMI Air Oxidation Processes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60, subpart III. Therefore, the proposed list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a compilation of all the chemicals in these databases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to characterize the SOCMI process units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Selection of Emission Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several emission sources associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI processes (e.g., process vents, product storage and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer operations, and equipment leaks); however, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSPS is directed toward the control of VOC emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater generated by SOCMI process units. This includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from wastewater collection and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Wastewater streams that contain organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds are generated at SOCMI process units by one of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms, either direct contact of water with organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds or by contamination of indirect contact water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through equipment leaks in chemical processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water may come in direct contact with organic compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a variety of different chemical processing steps, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus generating wastewater streams (referred to as ``process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater'') that must be discharged for treatment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal. Direct contact wastewater includes water used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wash impurities from organic compound products or reactants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water used to cool or quench organic compound vapor streams, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condensed steam from jet educator systems pulling vacuum on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels containing organic compounds, water from raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material and product storage tanks, water used as a carrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for catalysts and neutralizing agents (e.g., caustic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solutions), and water formed as a byproduct during chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions. Direct contact wastewater is also generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within SOCMI process units when water is used in equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washes and spill cleanups; this wastewater (referred to as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``maintenance wastewater'') is typically more variable in flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and concentration than process wastewater streams and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be collected in ways that differ from process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indirect contact wastewater streams are generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unintentional contact with organic compounds through leaks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in process equipment. For example, indirect contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater may be generated as a result of leaks from heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchangers, condensers, or pumps. These wastewaters also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be collected and treated differently from direct contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In both the SOCMI NSPS and the HON, ``wastewater'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined to encompass both process wastewaters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance wastewaters. Examples of process wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams include, but are not limited to, wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exiting process unit equipment (e.g., decanter water, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as condensed steam used in the process), product tank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drawdown, feed tank drawdown, filter-press filtrate, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residuals recovered from waste management units. Examples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of maintenance wastewater streams, which encompass all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance-related wastewater streams, are those generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distillation traps, and draining of pumps into an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drain system. However, the regulatory approach taken in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI NSPS is different from the one taken in the final HON. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed SOCMI wastewater NSPS requires that controls be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to reduce air emissions from both process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance wastewater streams from SOCMI process units that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce any of the listed chemicals. In the HON, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance wastewater is regulated by subpart F, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process wastewater is regulated by subpart G. Subpart F, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;63.105, requires the source owner or operator to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan which includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of procedures for managing wastewaters generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during maintenance. In the final HON, the facility's plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must include a description of procedures that will ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all maintenance wastewater is properly managed and HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are controlled. No such plan is required in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed NSPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA selected the regulatory approach for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance wastewater as proposed in the NSPS because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was determined through review of the industry, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included plant visits to newly constructed SOCMI process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, that the technologies available for the collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and treatment of these wastewaters have been adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated at SOCMI plants. The EPA is soliciting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on the proposed approach to regulating SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process unit maintenance wastewaters. The EPA is interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in receiving information on why new SOCMI process units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could not be designed and operated to control air emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from maintenance wastewaters in the same manner as process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters and information on the impact the small-quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff for process units and the low-flow exemption for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams will have on the collection and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of SOCMI maintenance wastewaters in relation to air emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastewater streams at SOCMI plants are collected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated in a variety of ways. Generally, wastewater passes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a series of collection and treatment units before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being recycled to the facility or discharged from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Collection and treatment schemes for wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are facility specific. The flow rate and organic compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition of wastewater streams at a particular plant are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions of the processes used, which in turn influence the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes and types of collection and treatment units. Many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection and treatment system units are either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly or indirectly open to the atmosphere; this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheric interface creates a potential for VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The magnitude of VOC emissions from SOCMI process unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters is dependent on factors such as the physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties of the pollutants, the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater, and the design of the individual collection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment unit managing the wastewater. Climatic factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as ambient temperature and wind speed also affect VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions at many wastewater collection and treatment units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential sources of VOC emissions associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater collection and treatment systems include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual drain systems, manholes, junction boxes, lift 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stations, trenches, sumps, weirs, oil-water separators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equalization or neutralization basins, clarifiers, aeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basins, storage and treatment tanks, surface impoundments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and containers. A discussion of each of these emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources is contained in Chapter 3 of the BID.

Volatile organic compounds are regulated due to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribution to the formation of ozone in the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere. Ozone is a listed criteria pollutant. Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ozone has been linked to both health and welfare impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health and welfare risks from these include impaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory function, eye irritation, deterioration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials such as rubber, and necrosis of plant tissue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for VOC emissions from wastewater can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed based on the characteristics of the wastewater at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its point of generation. Based on information and data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathered on the concentration of organics in SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams and on the flow rate of these streams, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VOC emissions from SOCMI wastewater streams are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to cause or contribute significantly to air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution.

D. Selection of Affected Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The choice of the affected facility for an NSPS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the Agency's interpretation of section 111 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Under section 111, the NSPS must apply to ``new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources''; ``source'' is defined as any building, structure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, or installation which emits or may emit ``any air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutant.'' Most industrial plants, however, consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous pieces or groups of equipment which emit air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants, and which might be viewed as ``sources.'' The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses the term ``affected facility'' to designate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, within a particular kind of plant, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chosen as the ``source'' covered by a given standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In choosing the affected facility, the EPA must decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which pieces or groups of equipment are the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units for separate emission standards in the particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial context involved and in light of the terms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of section 111. One major consideration in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination is that the use of a broader definition means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that replacement equipment is less likely to be regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the NSPS; if, for example, an entire plant were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as the affected facility, no part of the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be covered by the standard unless the plant as a whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were ``modified.'' Because the purpose of section 111 is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize emissions by the application of the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated control technology (considering cost, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and environmental effects, and energy requirements) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at all new and modified sources, there is a presumption that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a narrower designation of the affected facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. This ensures that new emission sources within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants will be brought under the coverage of the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as they are installed. This presumption can be overcome, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, if the Agency concludes that the relevant statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors (technical feasibility, cost, energy, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts) point to a broader definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor considered in the selection of an affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility for the NSPS is the definition used in existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental rules. The application of these factors is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SOCMI is normally represented as a system of production stages that produce a wide range of organic chemicals from
a set of 11 basic chemicals. The basic set of 11 chemicals is generated by refineries, natural gas plants, and coal tar
distillation plants. Organic chemicals are produced at a wide range of facilities, from large facilities manufacturing
a few chemicals in large volumes, to smaller facilities manufacturing many different finished chemicals in smaller
volumes. Each of the production stages or ``process units'' may include any of several VOC emission sources, one of
which is collection and treatment of wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three alternatives were considered for defining the affected facility in the NSPS. One option considered was to use
a variation of the definition of source used in the HON, which is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the set of emission points
in the organic HAP-emitting processes used to produce synthetic organic chemicals that are in a contiguous area under
common control.'' Under this option of broadly defining the source for the NSPS, the affected facility would include
all process units and associated process unit wastewater streams located at a plant with SOCMI process units. A second
option considered was the narrow definition used in the NSPS for refinery wastewater (40 CFR part 60, subpart QQQ),
which was ``(1) individual drain systems, (2) oil-water separators, and (3) aggregate facilities, which are defined
as all process drains connected to the first common downstream junction box down to the receiving oil-water separator.''
The third and final option considered was ``each individual SOCMI process unit'' where each SOCMI process unit is
defined as the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts that use or produce, as intermediates or final products,
one or more of the chemicals listed in the NSPS applicability section. (A process unit can be operated independently
if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The broader first option has been used previously by the EPA in an existing NESHAP (i.e., the HON) as the source definition
for existing SOCMI facilities. (Note: Under the HON's new source provisions, new SOCMI process units are subject
to the rule requirements under a more narrow source definition when specified conditions are met.) In that regulation,
the definition was purposely chosen to be broad to include all emission points at any given site under the regulation.
As stated earlier, a broad definition under an NSPS has a different effect. If an entire site is designated as the affected
facility for an NSPS, existing sources only become subject to the NSPS if the entire site is modified or reconstructed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second option, each piece of equipment in the wastewater collection and treatment system would be considered
a unique or individual affected facility. This definition, which has a precedent in the refinery wastewater NSPS,
is much narrower and more restrictive than the first option. In general, the narrower the definition of source, the
more likely it is that changes to existing facilities will be deemed ``new sources'' under the Act. This definition
would result in numerous sources within each SOCMI process unit, as well as numerous sources within the wastewater
collection and treatment system, being classified as affected facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third option, that of considering each process unit as an affected facility, also has recent precedent. The standards
for process wastewater components of the proposed pulp and paper rule (58 FR 66077, December 17, 1993) are structured
such that the process unit is the affected facility, and controls are required for wastewater streams generated by
these units. This approach is also consistent with the one taken in the HON for regulation of new SOCMI process units.
Defining the affected facility on a process unit basis avoids the problems associated with having multiple individual
collection and treatment system equipment components classified as affected facilities, and it also provides a
definition sufficiently narrow in scope so as not to preclude the possibility that existing sources will become subject
to the NSPS through the modification and reconstruction provisions. Most importantly, defining an affected facility
as a process unit reflects industry construction practices. Almost all new construction, reconstruction, and modification
in the SOCMI is carried out by process unit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After carefully considering each of the above alternatives, the EPA selected process units as the basis for defining
affected facilities for the proposed NSPS. This definition allows for routine equipment replacement and minor changes
or expansions in existing facilities without subjecting either single emission sources or entire plant sites to
requirements of the proposed standards. Providing for full coverage of all new process units will improve ambient
air quality, the goal of standards implemented under section 111.

Synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry process units, which are defined as the equipment assembled
and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product, include reactors

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 111 of the Act states that NSPS ``shall reflect the degree of emission limitation and the percentage reduction
achievable through application of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction which (taking
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impact
and energy requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.'' The technological
basis for NSPS that meets these criteria is referred to as ``best demonstrated technology (BDT).'' In the standards
development process for NSPS, BDT should be identified, the performance of BDT established, and a regulatory alternative
selected that will require the use of BDT or an equivalent technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two fundamentally different approaches to controlling VOC emissions from SOCMI wastewater sources. The
first is a source reduction or waste minimization approach in which the emission reduction is achieved through a reduction
in the quantity of wastewater generated and/or a reduction in the VOC content of the wastewater as a result of process
modifications, modifications of operating practices, improved preventive maintenance activities, increased
recycling, or segregation of VOC-containing waste streams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste minimization may be achieved through either source reduction or recycling. Source reduction involves the
implementation of steps that reduce either the amount of wastewater generated or the amount of VOC contained in the
wastewater streams. Recycling includes recovery and/or reuse of potential wastes. Within the SOCMI, there are several
means of achieving the objective of either of these waste minimization alternatives. However, in relation to SOCMI
wastewater, waste minimization techniques are, for the most part, process unit-specific, and the degree of emission
reduction achieved depends on the operating parameters of the individual process unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of a lack of adequate site-specific data regarding the waste minimization approach within SOCMI, the EPA
was unable to develop reasonable estimates of the emission control efficiency of the waste minimization options
achievable on a nationwide basis. For example, because pollution prevention activities such as process redesign
are site-specific, it would not be practical or possible to stipulate specific requirements for the large number
of chemical production processes subject to the proposed SOCMI wastewater NSPS. In addition, the EPA considers that
elimination of pollution through material substitution will not be possible in all cases within the SOCMI because
SOCMI products cannot be eliminated from use without adverse economic impact. Specifically, because the products
of the SOCMI are used in the production of polymers, resins, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, etc., elimination of a
SOCMI product would affect not only the SOCMI producer but also the downstream user of that SOCMI product. Many of the
end-use products (e.g., resins, pharmaceuticals, etc.) could not be made from other materials. Thus, the EPA maintains
that material substitution is better left determined by the marketplace than by mandate through a specific Federal
requirement. Therefore, for the reasons cited above, no waste minimization options were included in the regulatory
alternatives analysis for this NSPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA, however, believes that the SOCMI wastewater NSPS sufficiently encourages pollution prevention. For example,
within the regulation's applicability provisions, there is an exemption from the control requirements of the rule
for process units that generate wastewaters with small overall volatile organic quantities in the wastewater. Also,
the regulatory criteria for identifying the wastewater streams that require control for air emissions are expressed
in terms of action levels based on concentration and flow rate cutoffs below which controls are not required for the
wastewater stream. An owner or operator may use any means, including process changes or material substitution but
not treatment of the wastewater, to meet the criteria for either the small quantity process unit exemption or the concentration/low-flow
cutoff. In addition, within the provisions for wastewater collection and treatment operations, there are compliance
options that only specify a percent reduction of VOC emissions. Again, to comply with these options, an owner or operator
may use any means, including process changes or recovery devices, to reduce emissions by the specified percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second approach to achieving emission reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves emission suppression and treatment of wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams to remove or destroy the organic compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volatile organic compound emissions from SOCMI process unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater can be effectively reduced on a nationwide basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the following control approach: (1) Identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams with significant VOC emission potential; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) recycle or treat those wastewater streams to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their potential for emissions; (3) prior to treatment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, manage those waste streams in units that suppress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions or are equipped with air emission controls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) recycle any treatment residuals or treat any residuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to destroy VOC; and (5) control air emissions generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for VOC emissions from wastewater can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed based on the characteristics of the wastewater at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its point of generation. A reference test method, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 25D (40 CFR Part 60, appendix A), provides a relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator of wastewater emission potential and is used as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tool to implement air emission standards for wastewater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This method, when applied to a wastewater stream, yields a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration for the stream. While not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
true indicator of absolute emissions, the volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of a stream provides a relative indicator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential emissions of that stream as compared to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams that are similarly managed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three primary treatment technologies that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally applicable and effective in reducing the VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of SOCMI wastewater streams. These are steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stripping, air stripping, and biological treatment. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also are several other technologies or methods of treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are equally effective in their particular situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but are limited in their applicability within SOCMI. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other technologies include chemical oxidation, carbon and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ion exchange adsorption, membrane separation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid-liquid extraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steam stripping is the most universally applicable VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal technology for treating wastewater streams generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by SOCMI process units, and this treatment technology has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been selected as the basis for standards for SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater. The VOC removal efficiency of steam strippers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depends on the characteristics of both the steam stripper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the wastewater stream. Data collected by the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to steam stripper performance for the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters indicate that organic removal efficiencies of up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 99.9 percent have been demonstrated on wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at SOCMI plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA selected steam stripping as the BDT because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the most universally applicable treatment technology for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing organic compounds from wastewater streams with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to emit VOC and achieves the highest VOC emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction among demonstrated VOC control technologies. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that many SOCMI facilities employ biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment units for wastewater treatment. However, not all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the compounds regulated under the proposed NSPS are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly biodegradable, while most of the compounds can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated more readily by steam stripping. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of emissions reduction achieved by biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, even for biologically degradable compounds, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary among SOCMI sources because of the ranges in operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and design parameters, such as the biological degradation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate, surface area of the unit, aeration rate, hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residence time, and the active biomass concentration. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing biological treatment as the potential BDT, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the variability in performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant across the industry. Although a well operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and maintained biological treatment system can achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions as high as 99 percent, the variability in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance makes quantifying emission reductions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of setting a standard more difficult than for steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stripping. Emission reductions for biological treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems can only be determined on a site-specific basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the EPA emphasizes that SOCMI sources using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological treatment, or any other treatment technologies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can comply with the rule by consistently achieving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required emission reduction (i.e., 95 percent when using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biodegradation or 99 percent for other technologies).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To achieve the desired emission reduction from steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stripping or other treatment technology, it is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppress the wastewater emissions from the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation to the treatment device where the organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds are either removed or destroyed. Suppression of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions can be achieved by using physical covers, roofs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and water seals to minimize the contact between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater and the atmosphere. Examples of controls for air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from waste management units in a wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and treatment system, based on suppression 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques, include: fixed or floating roofs on tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water seals on drains, gas-tight covers on junction boxes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and covers and enclosures around oil-water separators. Hard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piping of a wastewater stream from its point of generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the steam stripper unit is one method to achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppression of air emission from the wastewater. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams may be managed in other units prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment if those units are equipped with air emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 111 of the Act requires an emission standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever it is feasible. Section 111(h) states that ``if in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the judgment of the Administrator, it is not feasible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribe or enforce a standard of performance, he may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead promulgate a design, equipment, work practice, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational standard, or combination thereof *&blank;*&blank;* '' The term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``not feasible'' is applicable if the emissions cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captured and vented through a vent or stack designed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that purpose, or if the application of a measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology is not practicable because of technological or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic limitations. The EPA is proposing standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions from the process unit wastewater segment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this source category. To ensure that emissions are captured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conveyed to a control device, the proposed standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include requirements for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An enclosed wastewater collection and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Treatment to reduce VOC concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Conveyance of emissions vented from the wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment device and the enclosed wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection system in a closed-vent system to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applicability levels are included in the SOCMI wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to identify those process unit wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are required to be controlled. Alternative formats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA identified certain low flow and low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration wastewater streams that are not believed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled at existing facilities. Parameters that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize these streams include volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the stream and volumetric flow rate, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which can be determined by using a variety of methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the EPA is proposing concentration and flow rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters to identify process unit wastewater streams that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not require control. The EPA also is proposing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process units that generate wastewater with a total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass of volatile organics less than 1 Mg per year are exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the control requirements of the rule. The EPA solicits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether it is feasible to otherwise identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific process unit wastewater streams to be controlled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also solicits information on defining these process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit wastewater streams.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two formats were considered in developing the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for waste management units. These formats were a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical emission standard and an equipment and work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice standard. A numerical standard would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible because it would be difficult to capture and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure emissions from SOCMI waste management units (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, surface impoundments, containers, individual drain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, and oil-water separators) for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating compliance. Due to the number of openings and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible emissions points, accurate measurement would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require enclosure of the entire airspace around each piece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of equipment. This approach would not be practical for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous equipment components. Therefore, the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the format of the standards for this source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category should include a combination of a design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, work practice, and operational standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of SOCMI waste management units, the intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the standard is to suppress and capture emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process unit wastewater collection and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. The suppression and capture of emissions is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished by the installation and proper maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roofs, covers, lids, water seals, and enclosures on tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface impoundments, containers, individual drain systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and oil-water separators. Captured emissions are then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vented to a control device through application of a closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vent system. Work practices such as periodic monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, and repair, would be required to ensure proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation and maintenance of the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards would require that emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from waste management units be controlled from the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation until the wastewater stream leaves the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device or is recycled to the process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emission Limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three alternative numerical emission limitation formats are proposed to provide sources with a maximum degree of
operational flexibility in complying with the standards. These emission limitation formats are: a mass percent
reduction of VOC in the process unit wastewater stream, an effluent concentration limitation for VOC for individual
wastewater streams, or a mass removal requirement for combined wastewater streams. The rationale for providing
these alternative emission limitations is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The percent reduction format is based on the VOC removal efficiency of a steam stripper; however, any treatment process
that can achieve the proposed efficiency can be used to comply with the standard. (See section IV.G for more discussion.)
Percent reduction was chosen because it is the best representation of control technology performance, and it may
be applied to any configuration of wastewater streams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effluent concentration limitations are also based on the performance of a steam stripper. Effluent concentration
limitations are provided as alternatives to the percent reduction standard to allow compliance flexibility for
facilities required to treat process unit wastewater streams. The use of this alternative is limited to facilities
that are treating only affected wastewater streams. The effluent concentration limit is not applicable to situations
where combinations or mixtures of both affected and unaffected wastewater streams are treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dilution becomes a concern when more than one waste stream is sent to a single treatment process. For example, diluting
a waste with other materials having a volatile organic concentration less than 500 ppmw as a means by which an owner
or operator lowers the volatile organic concentration of the waste from an affected stream to a level below 500 ppmw
would not comply with the requirements of the proposed standards. A process that simply mixes, blends, combines,
or aggregates a waste with other materials does not destroy the VOC in the waste or remove the VOC from the waste. Consequently,
when a waste is treated by an organic destruction or removal process, and the waste has been mixed or aggregated together
with other wastes or materials with a volatile organic concentration less than 500 ppmw prior to the point of waste
treatment, the proposed standards would require that owners or operators meet special requirements to ensure that
organics in the waste have actually been removed or destroyed. Under the proposed rules, an owner or operator would
be allowed to use a mass reduction requirement to meet the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required mass removal is an alternative for combined wastewater streams. This provision would require that mixed
wastes be treated by an organic destruction or removal process that reduces the volatile organic concentration of
the waste to meet a site-specific treatment process mass removal limit. This limit would be determined by the owner
or operator on a case-by-case basis using an equation specified in the rules that accounts for the reduction in the
volatile organic concentration of the resulting treated waste stream due to dilution. To use this equation, the owner
or operator would first determine the volatile organic concentration at the point of waste entry for each individual
waste stream that is mixed together prior to entering the treatment process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equipment Design and Operation Format. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another regulatory format proposed for process unit wastewater stream treatment is an equipment design and operational
format. The equipment standard consists of the installation of a steam stripper designed and operated at specified
parametric levels. The specifications for the steam stripper were developed to provide a standard piece of equipment
(with associated operating conditions) that can achieve either the mass percent VOC removal or the effluent concentration
of VOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This equipment design and operational format was included to provide an alternative means of compliance that all
sources would be able to use, while achieving the desired emission reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equipment and Work Practice Format. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final equivalent standard proposed for controlling process unit wastewater emissions is an equipment and work
practice standard. This format is based on the recycling of process unit wastewater in a closed collection system
to the process. When recycling is used, process unit wastewater emissions are controlled with equipment emissions,
and the process unit wastewater is reused. This format is proposed to encourage chemical recovery and waste minimization
and pollution prevention.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An emission standard and two equipment and design standards are proposed for VOC that are routed to vapor recovery
or destruction devices used to control VOC from vent collection sources. The proposed emission standard includes
two alternatives: a weight percent reduction and an outlet concentration. A mass emission limit was not appropriate
for these emission points because variation within the industry, including capacity and processes, greatly affects
emission rates, and data were not available to determine the mass limits that would address this variation. In general,
a weight percent reduction format will ensure that BDT is applied and the required emission reductions are realized.
However, combustion technology that is equivalent to BDT cannot be demonstrated to achieve the selected percent
reduction for streams with low VOC concentrations. Therefore, an alternative concentration limit that is achievable
has been included. The combination of the weight percent reduction or concentration limit will ensure that the best
technology is applied to all SOCMI process emission points, whether they have higher or lower concentrations.

Two equivalent standards, each of which is an equipment and design standard, are also proposed. The first equipment
and design standard is the requirement that gas streams be routed to a combustion device (other than flares) designed
and operated at a minimum temperature and residence time. For flares, an equipment standard with stated equipment
and operating specifications is being proposed as the format because it is very difficult to measure emissions from
a flare to determine its efficiency. These standards have been determined by the EPA to be equivalent to the emission
standards and are proposed to provide maximum compliance flexibility.

This section discusses the rationale for the selection of the standards for the SOCMI process unit wastewater source
category. The selection of applicability levels, numerical limitations for the emission standards, and design
parameters are included.

1. Applicability Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of developing wastewater standards, the EPA has concluded that the effectiveness of the control
technologies available to limit VOC emissions from wastewater does not vary. Controls are assumed to be either ``on''
or ``off,'' depending on whether a particular stream is identified as one that must be controlled. Therefore, the
basic foundation of the proposed provisions for SOCMI process unit wastewater is to identify wastewater streams
for control and treatment based on a specific criteria or action level at the point of wastewater generation, prior
to dilution and air emissions losses. Control of a wastewater stream is triggered if it is determined that the stream
exceeds the action level established by the standard. With this approach, the primary decision that needs to be made
in establishing BDT is selecting the appropriate action level for the source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory alternatives for a standard to control emissions from wastewater have, in previous EPA regulatory analyses,
been typically expressed in terms of action levels based on a concentration cutoff above which a wastewater stream
must be controlled. For the SOCMI wastewater NSPS, the primary action level will be defined in terms of the volatile
organic concentration, as measured by method 25D. The standard also includes exemptions for low flow streams. This
is in consideration of the fact that, even though a waste stream may exceed an action level, the total mass of contaminant
present in a stream with a low flow rate is low enough that the waste or wastewater stream does not have the potential
for significant emissions. Process units that generate wastewater with a total annual volatile organic mass less
than 1 Mg are also exempt from the control requirements of the proposed rule. The impacts analysis indicated that the
1 Mg/yr small quantity exemption has little effect on the emission reductions achieved under the regulatory alternatives
examined while significantly reducing the overall cost of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five regulatory alternatives analyzed in the development of the proposed standard were combinations of volatile
organic concentrations and flow rate cutoffs. The alternatives were analyzed both with and without the small quantity
cutoff of 1 Mg per year of volatile organic mass. For each regulatory alternative, steam stripping (or an equivalent
emission reduction technique) would be required for all wastewater streams with flow rates and volatile organic
concentrations greater than their respective action levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Values were chosen for concentration and flow rate cutoffs to span ranges believed by the EPA to be reasonable based
on knowledge of the SOCMI wastewater streams to be regulated and on previous standards development efforts. Further,
the ranges of flow rates and concentrations represented in these alternatives, when impacts are estimated, illustrate
the range of cost-effectiveness levels that apply to regulatory alternatives and allow selection of an alternative
that will achieve optimum control (i.e., greatest emission reduction for lowest cost). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously noted, method 25D provides a relative indicator of wastewater emission potential. While not a true
measure of VOC emissions, the volatile organic concentration of a wastewater stream does provide a relative means
of comparing the emission potential of a wastewater stream to other streams similarly managed and of comparing the
emission potential of a wastewater stream before and after treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed rule regulates VOC emissions, the first choice for a test method is one that measures the concentration
of all VOC. However, this approach would require speciation test methods which are costly to use. As an alternative,
the EPA selected method 25D which does not speciate but measures total volatile organic concentration. This method,
which is much less costly, has been used in other wastewater related regulations. For example, method 25D is allowed
in the HON for measuring volatile organic concentration in applicability determinations. However, the HON does
not allow use of method 25D in calculations of mass removal for treatment processes. Instead, the HON uses a test method
that speciates HAPs for determining mass removal by treatment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As currently structured, the proposed rule would make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive use of the volatile organic concentration (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured by Method 25D). The concentration cutoffs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining if a wastewater stream is an affected stream are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formatted in terms of the volatile organic concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small quantity cutoff of 1 Mg/yr is calculated using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration; the effluent concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit is expressed in term of volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration; and the mass removal requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule are calculated using the volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. The EPA is aware that using the volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic concentration rather than a direct measure of VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does have some limitations and drawbacks. The test method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to measure volatile organic concentration, Method 25D, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on volatility (i.e., Henry's Law) and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speciate organic compounds. Therefore, the results may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the presence of compounds that are not considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC (based on their photochemical reactivity). The EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering ways of discounting the non-VOC components of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test results but has not included a means to do so in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulation. One option for accomplishing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be to allow owners or operators the option of using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test method that speciates VOC. If this approach is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected, provisions could also be made to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured VOC concentration to be adjusted to represent VO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration by multiplying by the fraction emitted (f
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values reported in the IWW CTG. The EPA also intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an alternative percent reduction standard based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stripability of specific volatile organic constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach is also described in the IWW CTG. Because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issues associated with the use of method 25D for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability and compliance determinations, the EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting comments all aspects of this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 1 is to require emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only of those SOCMI process unit wastewater streams having a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration at the point of wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation equal to or greater than 1,000 ppmw and a flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate greater than or equal to 10 Lpm. Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 2 is to require emission control only of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SOCMI process unit wastewater streams having a volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic concentration at the point of wastewater generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to or greater than 800 ppmw and a flow rate greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than or equal to 5 Lpm. Regulatory Alternative 3 is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require emission control only of those SOCMI process unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams having a volatile organic concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the point of wastewater generation equal to or greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 500 ppmw and a flow rate greater than or equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 Lpm. Regulatory Alternative 4 is to require emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control only of those SOCMI process unit wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having a volatile organic concentration at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater generation equal to or greater than 100 ppmw and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a flow rate greater than or equal to 1 Lpm. Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives 1 through 4 also have a maximum volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic concentration limit whereby any wastewater stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a volatile organic concentration above the limit would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require emission control regardless of the wastewater stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate; for Regulatory Alternatives 1 through 4, the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum concentration limit of 10,000 ppmw was used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives analysis. Regulatory Alternative 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to require air emission control for all SOCMI process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit wastewater streams with any detectable volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration as determined at the point of wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation (i.e., a volatile organic concentration action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of 0 ppmw). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA estimated nationwide VOC emission reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would be achieved by implementing air rules based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the five regulatory alternatives; the EPA also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated the capital and annual cost of achieving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission reductions and the nonair quality environmental and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy impacts associated with each regulatory alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates of emissions and costs reflect the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts in the fifth year following promulgation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSPS. The methodology used to develop estimates of VOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions and other impacts within the SOCMI source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the five regulatory alternatives is based on the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a model plant analysis and is discussed in detail in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 6 of the BID and in docket number A&hyph;94&hyph;32. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model plants are typically defined to represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected facility over a range of sizes corresponding to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range found in the regulated industry. Two previous EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies developed model plants that relate to emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams at SOCMI facilities: the Guideline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Series Document for the Control of Volatile Organic Compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions from Industrial Wastewater (EPA&hyph;453/D&hyph;93&hyph;056, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1992 Draft) and the BID related to the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HON (EPA&hyph;453/D&hyph;92&hyph;016, November 1992). The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed model plants for the SOCMI wastewater NSPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory analysis by making use of information, data, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies developed in these previous studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of implementing any of the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives (baseline), nationwide, fifth-year wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process units are estimated to be approximately 37.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousand Mg/yr. Assuming implementation of the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives, the emissions are 24.1 thousand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 1, an emission reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from baseline of 13.0 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual cost of about $4.3 million; 23.1 thousand Mg/yr for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 2, an emission reduction from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline of 14.0 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of about $5.2 million; 21.0 thousand Mg/yr for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 3, an emission reduction from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline of 16.2 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of about $8.8 million; 18.6 thousand Mg/yr for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 4, an emission reduction from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline of 18.6 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of about $15.6 million; and 14.2 thousand Mg/yr for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 5, an emission reduction from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline of 22.9 thousand Mg/yr achieved at total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of about $41.1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control costs reflect the fact that most plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the NSPS will also be affected by the HON, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are expected to install a steam stripper for treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams regulated by the HON. The proposed NSPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will require these SOCMI plants to control additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams that do not require control under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON. In estimating cost impacts of the NSPS, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that those plants affected by both regulations would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the capacity of the steam stripper required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HON rule to provide sufficient capacity to handle the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional wastewater streams that would require control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the NSPS. The costs associated with the NSPS is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in costs for the two steam strippers, one with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capacity to handle wastewater streams regulated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON and the other with the capacity to handle wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams regulated by both the HON and the NSPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the alternatives and the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions achieved, the resulting control costs, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated impacts, the EPA concluded that the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in Regulatory Alternative 3 reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the best system of emission reduction that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been adequately demonstrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more stringent level of emissions limitation was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected because control beyond Regulatory Alternative 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would result in costs that are disproportionately large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to the additional emission reduction achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 were estimated to achieve an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional emission reduction of about 2.4 thousand and 6.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousand Mg/yr, respectively, at an additional cost of about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$6.8 million or $32.3 million for the two alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the control requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new, modified, and reconstructed SOCMI process units would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to two sets of wastewater streams: streams with flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates of 1 Lpm or greater and a volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of 500 ppmw or greater; and any stream with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration of 10,000 ppmw or greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(regardless of flow rate).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, effective control of SOCMI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process unit wastewater emissions requires control from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point of generation until treated to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment standards, or until recycled to a controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process unit that is in compliance with the standards. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed standards require that emissions be controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during wastewater collection and transport in piping or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual drain systems and during handling and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in wastewater tanks, containers, surface impoundments, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment devices by using covers, lids, water seals, roofs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and enclosures designed to reduce emissions. Proper work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices, including periodic monitoring, inspection, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair, are also required to ensure that the equipment will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control emissions. Emissions from these wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection, transport, and handling systems are believed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be significant, thereby requiring the use of controls to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively reduce air emissions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation provides four options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating compliance with the SOCMI process unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment standards: three treatment options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on numerical emission limitations and an equipment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design specification. Of the options based on numerical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limitations, the first option may be adopted by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected sources. The remaining options based on numerical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limitations may only be used by certain classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, as discussed below. Any facility may choose to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equipment and design specification as an alternative to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emission limitation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first treatment process compliance option is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of VOC from the wastewater based on the removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of the BDT, which is a design steam stripper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., a steam stripper meeting specific design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational criteria). Under this equipment and design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard option for demonstrating compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process wastewater treatment standard, if the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator installs and operates a steam stripper that meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements, listed below, the treatment unit is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the treatment process standard of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These design and operating parameters include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Minimum active column height of 5 meters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Countercurrent flow configuration with a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10 actual trays; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Minimum steam flow rate of 0.04 kilograms of steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per liter of wastewater feed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Minimum wastewater feed temperature to the steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stripper of 95 degrees Centigrade; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maximum liquid loading of 67,100 liters per hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per square meter; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(6) Minimum steam quality of 2,765 kilojoules per kilogram. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of three additional treatment process compliance options that are formatted as a numerical emission limitations
is a requirement for 99-percent removal of volatile organic mass from the wastewater. The 99-percent removal may
be achieved through use of steam stripping on other control technologies. For example, another way to achieve the
99-percent removal is through air stripping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second treatment process compliance option that is provided for demonstrating compliance is to treat the wastewater
stream to achieve a volatile organic concentration of 50 ppmw provided the owner or operator demonstrate a volatile
organic mass removal of 95 percent or greater. This treatment option is provided to allow additional flexibility
for the owner in demonstrating compliance with the wastewater treatment standard; treatment of wastewater streams
to a concentration of less than 50 ppmw generates a wastewater stream that would require no additional control from
the point at which it exits the treatment unit. This option is limited in its applicability for the reasons discussed
in Section IV.F.3. The 50 ppmw limit was selected based on analysis characterizing the volatile organic concentration
of wastewater streams in the SOCMI database that would be subject to the proposed standards both before and after treatment.
The limit is the minimum concentration that characterizes the volatile organic level of SOCMI wastewater streams
treated to comply with the proposed standards using the BDT steam stripper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third numerical emission limitation option for demonstrating compliance is to remove a calculated mass of VOC
from a wastewater stream where the mass of VOC to be removed is calculated on the basis of the annual average wastewater
density and flow rate and the volatile organic average concentration in the wastewater stream. This option is designed
to accommodate the control of combined streams for the reasons discussed in section IV.F.3. The proposed rule also
provides an alternative treatment process compliance option for biological treatment units; under the alternative,
an owner or operator must treat affected wastewater streams in a biological treatment unit that destroys at least
95 percent of the organics. The EPA is allowing a 95-percent destruction efficiency for biological treatment units
as a compliance alternative for the treatment process standards in part because the Agency believes the use of these
units will have the effect of increasing the overall mass reduction achieved under the rule. This results from the
fact that if affected wastewater streams are allowed to be managed in a biological treatment unit, then it is fully
expected that other non- affected wastewater streams would also be managed in these biological treatment units,
resulting in additional control achieved or streams that may not otherwise be controlled under the regulation. The
alternative for biotreatment units in this rule is also consistent with other regulations regarding wastewater
treatment, such as the biotreatment provisions of the HON.

4. Vent Collection for Vapor Recovery or Destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volatile organic compounds are emitted from vents on enclosed or covered process wastewater collection and treatment
system devices such as individual drain systems and steam strippers. These emissions are required to be vented through
a closed-vent system meeting the requirements established in the rule. The closed-vent system must route these vapors
to a vapor recovery or destruction device achieving at least a 95-percent destruction or recovery. This limitation
is based on the average efficiency of a conventional VOC recovery devices. The option of meeting an equivalent standard
(achieving an outlet concentration of 20 ppm by volume on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen or providing a minimum
residence time and temperature) for enclosed combustion devices is provided as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because biological treatment units destroy the VOC in the wastewater, a well-operated biological treatment unit
is not required to be covered and vented to vapor recovery and destruction. Instead, the proposed regulation requires
an owner or operator electing to use a biological treatment unit to meet the 95 percent control requirement by demonstrating
that 95 percent of the volatile organic entering the biological treatment unit is being destroyed and not emitted
to the atmosphere.

H. Modification and Reconstruction Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the General Provisions for modification (40 CFR 60.14) and reconstruction (40 CFR 60.15), facilities that
are modified or reconstructed after the date of proposal of a standard are subject to the standard. An owner or operator
of an existing facility who is planning changes in the facility that could be considered modification or reconstruction
shall notify the appropriate EPA Regional Office 60 days prior to making the changes or commencing construction,
as applicable. The enforcement division of the appropriate EPA Regional Office will make the final determination
as to whether an existing facility is modified or reconstructed and, as a result, subject to the standards of performance
of an affected facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon modification of any emission source, an existing facility becomes an affected facility and therefore, subject
to the standard. With certain exceptions, any physical or operational change to an existing process unit that would
increase the emission rate from that process unit of any pollutant covered by the standard would be considered a modification
within the meaning of section 111 of the Act. If a physical or operational change to an existing process unit would increase
VOC emissions from the process unit, the owner or operator either can take appropriate measures to offset the emission
increase within the process unit such that there is no overall net increase in emissions from the process unit as a result
of the physical or operational change, or allow the process unit to be classified as an affected facility under the
modification criteria and control the process unit to meet the requirements of the NSPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations, an emission increase from one affected facility (i.e., process unit) may not be offset
with a similar emission decrease at another affected facility to avoid becoming subject to NSPS. In addition, all
emissions, not just the incremental increase in emissions, of the pollutants that have increased from the affected
facility must be in compliance with the applicable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the General Provisions to part 60, the following physical or operational changes are not considered to be modifications
even though emissions may increase as a result of the change (see &sect;60.14(e)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (e.g., lubrication of mechanical equipment; replacement of pumps,
motors, and piping; cleaning of equipment); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An increase in production rate without a capital expenditure (as defined in &sect;60.2); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An increase in the hours of operation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to proposal of the standard, the existing facility was designed
to accommodate that alternative fuel or raw material; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The addition or use of any system or device whose primary function is to reduce air pollutants, except when an emission
control system is replaced by a system determined by the EPA to be less environmentally beneficial; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Relocation or change in ownership of the existing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion identifies some possible changes to process unit operations used in SOCMI that might be
considered modifications. The magnitude of the industry covered and the complexity of the manufacturing process
permit only a general discussion of these possible changes. Therefore, the list of potential modifications for process
units provided below is not inclusive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Feedstock, Catalyst, or Reactant Substitution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Feedstock, catalyst, or reactant substitution is dictated by economics and the level of availability of the feedstock,
catalyst, or reactant. Depending upon the specific process, changes in feedstock or catalyst may require substantial
capital investment to modify the process to accommodate the change. The magnitude of the capital investment may prohibit
feedstock or catalyst substitution for many chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the chemicals produced in the SOCMI can be manufactured from two or more different feedstocks. For example,
cyclohexane can be manufactured using either phenol or cyclohexanol as the feedstock. In most cases, however, feedstock
substitution would likely require both equipment and process changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substitution of reactants within the SOCMI process units is also a likely change that could constitute a modification.
For example, for many chemicals, the potential exists to substitute air for pure oxygen or a chemical oxidant as a reactant
or vice versa. Changing to an air oxidation process may be advantageous because: (1) Air is readily available; and
(2) expensive corrosion-resistant materials are not required compared to the use of chemical oxidants. However,
there may be major disadvantages in changing from an oxygen or chemical oxidation process to an air oxidation process,
including a substantial reduction in plant capacity, a large increase in the reactor-related process vent stream
flow rate (i.e., increased VOC emissions), and an altered product mix. The use of oxygen or air oxidation may be substituted
for chemical oxidation processes as well. Reactant substitutions of this type may increase process unit VOC emissions
to the atmosphere and, as a result, may constitute a modification (unless the fixed capital expenditure exceeds 50
percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable new facility, in which case it would be considered
reconstruction).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Process Equipment Changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Process equipment changes also may constitute modifications. Examples of potential modifications are replacing
a fixed-bed reactor with a fluidized-bed reactor, increasing the plant capacity by increasing the size of the reactor
or adding additional reactors, and changing the product recovery system (e.g., from an absorber to a condenser).
Such changes might be considered modifications because they can result in increased VOC emissions. Again, capital
expenditures may be a factor in determining whether the change is a modification or a reconstruction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Combinations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A combination of the changes described above could be chosen in any given situation with the decision based on the most
advantageous economics for the site-specific conditions. The combination of changes might be considered a modification
if they resulted in an increase in emissions. The most common combinations are plant expansions or simultaneous changes
in feedstock and catalyst as described earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Reconstruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An existing facility may become subject to NSPS if it is reconstructed. Reconstruction is defined in &sect;60.15
as the replacement of the components of an existing facility to the extent that: (1) The fixed capital cost of the new
components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable new facility; and (2) it
is technically and economically feasible for the facility to meet the applicable standards. Because the EPA considers
reconstructed facilities to constitute new construction rather than modification, reconstruction determinations
are made irrespective of changes in emission rates. If the facility is determined to be reconstructed, it must comply
with all of the provisions of the standards of performance applicable to that facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards include requirements for continuous monitoring to ensure that owners suppress and capture
emissions from the process unit wastewater collection system, treat the wastewater to reduce the VOC concentration,
and convey emission from the wastewater collection and treatment to a control device as specified in the regulation.
The specific parameters that need to be monitored are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced monitoring is required for certain control device parameters to demonstrate compliance with the standards.
Failure to maintain the established values of the monitored parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission
limits of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Wastewater Collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards require monitoring to ensure that the wastewater collection system equipment, which includes tanks,
surface impoundments, containers, and drain systems, is operated with no detectable leaks. The standards require
owners or operators to monitor initially using Method 21 to demonstrate that the system has no detectable leaks according
to the procedures in the rule. The standards also include a requirement for semi-annual visual inspection of the wastewater
collection system to detect and repair any leaks in the individual drain system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Wastewater Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation requires each owner or operator using a steam stripper to comply with the design and equipment
standard specified for wastewater treatment processes to install, calibrate, operate, and maintain according
to manufacturers' specifications continuous monitors with continuous recorders of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The mass rate of wastewater fed to the stripper; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The mass rate of steam fed to the stripper; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The wastewater column feed temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These parameters are either established during an initial performance test or according to design specification
in the regulation. They are typically monitored in the industry to ensure proper operation; therefore, ensuring
continuous compliance of a steam stripper with the specified requirements for VOC removal requires no additional
monitoring burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners or operators using a biological treatment unit to achieve a 95-percent total VOC reduction across the unit
are required to measure the volatile organic concentration in the influent and effluent on a monthly basis and identify
appropriate parameters to be monitored to ensure continuous compliance. These parameters must be determined during
the initial performance test as demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, and monitored accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Enclosure and Closed-vent System Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule establishes requirements to ensure that negative pressure is maintained on enclosures and that
emissions are routed through a closed-vent system with no detectable leaks. If the closed-vent system contains bypass
lines, the proposed standards require the owner or operator to ensure emissions are not bypassing the control device.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An initial performance test must be conducted to ensure that negative pressure is maintained on all openings of each
enclosure, and a monthly inspection must be performed to confirm that any enclosure openings that were closed during
the performance test remain closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure continuous compliance with the requirement of no detectable leaks from the enclosure and closed-vent system,
monitoring with a portable hydrocarbon detector is required to be performed initially along with a program of annual
visible inspections of ductwork, piping, and connections to covers for evidence of visible defects. If visible defects
in the closed-vent system are observed, readings greater than 500 ppm by volume above background are measured, or
enclosure openings do not have negative pressure, a first effort to repair the closed-vent system must be made as soon
as practicable and no later than 5 calendar days after identification of the problem. The repair must be completed
no later than 15 calendar days after identification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure the control device is not being bypassed if bypass lines are present, owners or operators must install, calibrate,
maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's instructions a flow indicator that provides a record of emission
point gas stream flow at least once every 15 minutes. As an alternative, the proposed rule allows bypass lines to be
sealed in the closed position and visually inspected to ensure they are being maintained in the closed position. The
use of flow indicators or seals on the bypass lines ensures that process vent streams are continuously being routed
to the control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Control Device Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of enhanced monitoring is to provide a means for major sources to demonstrate that the affected facility
is in continuous compliance with the standards. In light of these requirements, the EPA has considered how sources
subject to the NSPS would demonstrate continuous compliance with standards for SOCMI process unit wastewater.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA considered three monitoring options for control devices: (1) the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS)
to measure total VOC; (2) the use of CEMS for surrogate compounds such as total hydrocarbons (THC) as surrogate for
total VOC; or (3) the continuous monitoring of control device operating parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first two options were determined to be unreasonable for this industry as discussed below. Although continuous
emission monitors for total VOC are currently available, these devices are not universally applicable within this
source category. Current emission monitoring systems that measure VOC emissions operate by flame ionization detection
(FID), photoionization detection (PID), non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) absorption, or other detection principles
that respond to VOC levels. However, in most cases, VOC monitors provide only a measure of the relative concentration
level of a mixture of organics, rather than quantification of the organic species present. This trait necessitates
the use of VOC CEMS more as a relative indicator rather than as a conventional emission monitor. Cases where it is possible
to consider the VOC monitor as a conventional CEMS are, for the most part, limited to instances where only one organic
species is present or where equal incremental amounts of each of the organic species present generate equal instrument
responses. These instances are very unlikely to occur at SOCMI process units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a CEMS system that uses gas chromatography to measure gaseous organic compound emissions may not be suitable
for applications where the number of VOC compounds to be monitored exceeds five. (See proposed Performance Specifications
101 and 102, appendix A of 40 CFR part 64, October 22, 1993 at 58 FR 54648.) However, SOCMI wastewaters can be expected
routinely to have multiple chemical constituents with variable concentrations. Under these conditions, implementation
of a CEMS system would be a costly undertaking. Furthermore, parametric monitoring has been demonstrated to be an
effective means of indicating continuous compliance. Therefore, because a CEMS requirement would place an extra
burden on the industry without increasing the accuracy of compliance demonstrations, the first two options were
determined to be unreasonable. Owners or operators using control devices (e.g., incinerators or condensers) to
comply with the proposed standards may use CEMS where applicable to demonstrate continuous compliance. However,
parameter monitoring is also allowed if control devices are used. The Agency has selected temperature as the operating
parameter that would then be monitored to determine ongoing compliance with the standard. For example, owners or
operators of incinerators would have to monitor the combustion temperature (or the temperature before and after
the catalyst bed if a catalytic incinerator is used), and owners or operators of condensers would have to monitor the
temperature of the vapor exhaust stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of CEMS on control devices is not proposed to be required for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) CEMS cannot accurately determine compliance for many SOCMI wastewaters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each of these control systems a measurable control device parameter (e.g., temperature) is considered to
provide a suitable indication of performance for determining compliance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Temperature monitors are considerably less costly than CEMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards, therefore, would be based on parameter monitoring to demonstrate compliance with the standards
for control devices. The Agency is soliciting comments on the selection of temperature as a parameter to monitor for
compliance and any available data on the correlation of the control device parameter to the control efficiency. The
proposed rule would not preclude owners or operators who are using control devices to comply with the rule from choosing
to use CEMS to demonstrate compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The continuous monitoring of control device operating parameters, established during the performance test or specified
through design, is used to determine whether continuous compliance is achieved. Failure to maintain the established
values for these parameters would be an enforceable violation of the emission limits of the proposed standards. Some
of the process parameters are already monitored as part of normal operation. Therefore, continuous compliance is
assured without imposing an additional unnecessary burden on the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, enhanced monitoring is only applicable to control devices used to meet the requirements of the
regulation. However, the EPA fully intends to make this rule consistent with other enhanced monitoring requirements.
Therefore, the EPA is soliciting comments on the extent the enhanced monitoring requirements in the proposed rule
are sufficient to meet the overall requirements of the Agency with regard to enhanced monitoring under section 114(a)
of the CAAA or are additional requirements needed within the rule to meet the requirements of the CAAA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Performance Test Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Test methods and procedures are required to ensure compliance with the proposed standards, which include requirements
for demonstrating that an emission point or process unit wastewater stream does not require control or that it is in
compliance with the control requirements. Requirements to test for no detectable leaks from control devices, enclosure
and closed-vent systems, and process wastewater collection and treatment systems are also included.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Wastewater Concentration and Flow Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards require the use of approved test methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and procedures to ensure consistent and verifiable results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for demonstration that a wastewater stream does not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, or for demonstration that the allowed emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels are achieved when controls are applied. Affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater streams are subject to the standards if they meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either of the following conditions at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The average flow rate of the affected wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream is 1.0 Lpm or greater and the mass-weighted average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration is 500 ppmw or greater; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The mass-weighted average volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the affected wastewater stream is 10,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppmw or greater, regardless of the stream flow rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two important parameters must be quantified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether an affected stream must be controlled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These parameters are the annual wastewater quantity for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream and the volatile organic concentration of the stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the point of generation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several methods can be used to determine wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity. These methods include using knowledge about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity of the wastewater-generating process or the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management unit, and using measurements that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of maximum annual wastewater generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. Knowledge-based methods are allowed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility and to provide less expensive alternatives than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual annual measurement if the appropriate information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For quantifying the volatile organic concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewater streams, three methods are available: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Knowledge of the wastewater streams; (2) bench scale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot scale test data; or (3) physical measurements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration. These methods have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to provide flexibility and to provide less expensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives than actual measurement if the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the actual volatile organic concentration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater stream is determined through direct measurement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation specifies that the procedures of Method 25D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in appendix A of part 60, ``Determination of the Volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic Concentration of Waste Samples,'' which provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative measure of the emissions potential of the stream, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to analyze the sample. Alternatively, the sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be analyzed to determine the volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration using any test method or test data that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been validated according to the protocols in Method 301 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A of part 63. As pointed out in section II of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document, there are several issues associated with the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of method 25D on which the EPA is soliciting comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flow rates may be determined using information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum annual production capacity of the process unit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge of the process, and mass balance information or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring the flow rate at the point of generation during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that are representative of average wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generation rates.

2. Performance Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial performance test requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 60.8 of the part 60 General Provisions are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for treatment processes or vent stream control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices. Instead, the proposed standards provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative means of compliance that the EPA considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to the direct measurement of emissions as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under &sect;60.8 and less burdensome to the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule includes treatment process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance test procedures for the effluent concentration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent reduction, and required mass removal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These test procedures involve measurements of volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic concentrations using Method 25D or any other methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which the results are validated using Method 301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance testing is to be conducted at representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inlet flow rates and at volatile organic concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under which it would be most difficult to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For noncombustion treatment processes complying with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percent reduction requirement, the total volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic mass flow rate entering the treatment process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exiting the treatment process shall be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing the product of the average flow rate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater stream entering or exiting the treatment process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the average total volatile organic concentration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering or exiting wastewater streams, respectively. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater streams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be determined using the inlet and outlet flow meters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For combustion treatment processes complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent reduction requirement, the total volatile organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass flow rate entering the combustion unit shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by computing the product of the average flow rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the wastewater stream entering the combustion unit, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the inlet flow meter, and the average total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volatile organic concentration in the waste stream entering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combustion device. The volume exhausted shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A, as appropriate. The average total organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration in the exhaust downstream of the combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit shall be determined using Method 18 of appendix A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 60, or any other test method validated according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of part 63.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A performance test to demonstrate compliance of a vent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream control device with the organic compound reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency requirement shall use Method 1 or 1A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, to select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling sites. The mass flow rate of organics entering and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exiting the control device shall be determined by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of part 60, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, to determine the volume exhausted and by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 18 of appendix A of part 60, or any other test method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A of part 63, to determine total organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A performance test to demonstrate compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass removal provision shall consist of a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass removal required to be achieved and a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass removal actually achieved. The total required mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal is calculated by adding together the required mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal for each individual affected stream to be combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for treatment. The required mass removal for each affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater stream prior to combination of the streams for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment shall be determined using the wastewater average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate and volatile organic average concentration at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point of generation for each affected wastewater stream to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be combined for treatment. The actual total volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic mass removal in the wastewater stream shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined using the same procedures as described for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncombustion treatment processes complying with the percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a performance test to demonstrate compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a biological treatment process with the 95-percent mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction requirement must be conducted using the procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the proposed rule. The control efficiency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the biological treatment unit is a function of the fraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biodegraded in a properly operated biological treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. This fraction shall be determined using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures in appendix C of 40 CFR part 63. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A performance test is not specified for the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steam stripper; installation of the specified equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along with monitoring to show attainment of the specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating parameter levels, demonstrates compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment design and operation provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each vapor collection system, closed-vent system, fixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roof, cover, or enclosure must be evaluated initially and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual intervals using Method 21 of appendix A of part 60 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the presence of detectable emissions from leaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 21 represents the best available method for detecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks from these sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting requirements necessitated by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard are authorized by section 114 of the Act. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the part 60 General Provisions, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard would require the submittal of several types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports. First, the part 60 General Provisions would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require notification reports, which inform the Agency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities subject to the NSPS. These reports include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification of construction, anticipated and actual startup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates, and physical or operational changes. In addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information required by the General Provisions, owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operators would be required to provide information with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice of construction identifying the process unit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stream as well as a brief description of the intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment and/or control technology. As part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification of startup, sources would also be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide more detailed information on the waste stream and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste management units. For example, sources would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the chemical manufacturing processes that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the proposed rule, information on the intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance strategy, and any required control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter ranges, unless the parameter ranges have already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been established in the operating permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reports of the required design analysis (for steam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strippers) or of performance test results of emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control systems would be required as well. These reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show whether a facility is initially meeting the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard. The proposed rule would override the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions requirements for quarterly reports for excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions and monitoring systems performance. Instead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semi-annual reports would be required in the event of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control equipment failure or instance when monitored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters are not within their established values. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semi-annual report shall include the date of the inspection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of each waste management unit in which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control equipment failure was detected, description of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure, and description of the nature of and date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair was made. The semi-annual report shall also contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on monitoring results that exceed the boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in the operating permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

L. Solicitation of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA seeks full public participation in arriving at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its final decisions, and strongly encourages comments on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of this proposal from all interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever applicable, full supporting data and detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis should be submitted to allow the EPA to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum use of the comments. The Agency invites all parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to coordinate their data collection activities with the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to facilitate mutually beneficial and cost-effective data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions. The EPA is interested in participating in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study plans, data collection, and documentation. Please 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of this preamble for technical contacts at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA. All comments should be directed to the EPA Air Docket, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;32 (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Comments on this notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be accepted to the date specified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the EPA particularly requests comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed approach to reducing the burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners or operators of waste management units, treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes, or control devices that allows owners or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators to comply with the control requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed SOCMI NSPS for these waste management units, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment processes, or control devices by demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the benzene waste operations NESHAP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HON, or the RCRA air emission standards for hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The EPA's proposed approach to identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters that define process unit wastewater streams that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not require control, whether it is feasible to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such streams in ways other than through concentration or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rate cutoffs, and information for defining such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The selection of temperature as a control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter to monitor to demonstrate compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device standards, and the correlation between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature and the control efficiency, especially for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regenerable activated carbon adsorption systems; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The inclusion of maintenance wastewater as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scope of the proposed standards and any barriers to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of maintenance wastewater streams that meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration and flow criteria used to identify those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streams that require control at new facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The accessibility of SOCMI monitoring data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic reports to the general public as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 114(c) of the CAAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The extent the enhanced monitoring requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule are sufficient to meet the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the EPA for enhanced monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The appropriateness of using method 25D and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting volatile organic concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability and compliance determinations within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure of the proposed regulation without discounting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-VOC portion of the volatile organic concentration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also without eliminating low volatility compounds from test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The relevance of including in the NSPS an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative percent reduction compliance option for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment processes that is based on the fraction removed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the design steam stripper for the individually speciated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing to submit proprietary information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for consideration should clearly distinguish such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from other comments, and clearly label it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Confidential Business Information.'' Submissions containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such proprietary information should be sent directly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact person listed above, and not to the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information covered by such a claim of confidentiality will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be disclosed by the EPA only to the extent allowed and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. If no claim of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality accompanies the submission when it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the EPA, it may be made available to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without further notice to the commenter.

B. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993), the EPA must determine whether a regulation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented in the public record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), federal agencies are required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assess the economic impact of federal regulations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities. The Act specifically requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of a Regulatory flexibility Analysis in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances where small business impacts are possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the impact of the proposed rule on all entities is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to be insignificant in terms of changes in industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output, changes in expansion plans, and employment loss, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reasonable to conclude that small entities, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their number, are not significantly affected. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these standards impose no adverse economic impacts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1902 passage of the Reclamation Act, (43 U.S.C. 391, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) provided for the creation of the Reclamation fund (a fund within the U.S. Treasury) to be used to finance water projects
in the arid west. These water projects were to be constructed on a reimbursable basis with the water users repaying
the funds advanced from the Reclamation fund, without interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The early Reclamation projects were for irrigation only, and the irrigators were responsible for the repayment of
all costs associated with these projects. Intending to recover the costs of construction projects as quickly as possible,
Congress set the time frame for the repayment of funds by the water users in this initial period at 10 years. This responsibility,
and the original repayment time frame of 10 years, proved to be a difficult and significant burden on the water users.
In 1914, this term was extended to 20 years by Section 2 of the Reclamation Extension Act of August 13, 1914 (43 U.S.C.
475). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, the funds that made up the Reclamation fund were from revenues generated by the sale of public lands (see
Section 1 of the Reclamation Act of 1902.) It soon became apparent that this source of revenue was not sufficient to
cover the costs of constructing water projects. This was addressed in a variety of statutes, one of which was the Sundry
Civil Expenses Appropriations Act for 1920 (43 U.S.C. 394). This act forms the basis for the allocation of lease revenues
by requiring that revenues generated from the leasing of withdrawn Reclamation lands would be a credit to the Reclamation
fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1920's saw the agriculture industry experiencing serious economic difficulties that further affected the water
users' ability to meet their contractual obligations to the United States. Responding to these difficulties, Congress
enacted the Fact Finders Act of 1924. Section 4, Subsection I of the Fact Finders Act created an entitlement program
that allowed the direct crediting of certain revenues to the water users. Providing the water users assumed responsibility
for the operation and maintenance of the project, the revenues from certain activities conducted on Federal lands
would be used toward relieving the water users of their yearly payment on the construction costs. The revenues were
restricted to those from project power plants, leasing of project lands for grazing and farms, and the sale or use of
townsite lots. These revenues were to be applied as a direct or front-end credit: (1) To the water users' annual construction
charges; (2) to their annual project operation and maintenance expenses; and (3) as directed by the water users (43
U.S.C. 501). Revenues were required to be credited to construction costs until all obligations to the United States
have been repaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional relief was provided when the Congress approved The Omnibus Adjustment Act of May 25, 1926, that allowed
the Secretary to extend the crediting provisions of Subsection I to water districts in identified projects without
requiring them to assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of the project. Section 45 of the Omnibus Adjustment
Act also allowed the Secretary of the Interior to amend existing water-rights contracts, at the request of the water
district, to extend the repayment period to 40 years (43 U.S.C. 423d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress did not, in its enactment of Subsection I, repeal prior revenue specific statutes, nor did it indicate
that the revenue disposition requirements reflected in Subsection I would extend to revenues derived from sources
not identified. For example, the revenue disposition requirements of the Act for the Sale of Surplus Acquired Lands
of February 2, 1911, provided for the revenues from the sale of such lands to be a ``credit to the project'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than a credit to the water users (43 U.S.C. 374).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection J of the Fact Finders Act (43 U.S.C. 526) also required the revenues generated by the sale of surplus water
under the Warren Act (43 U.S.C. 523) to be deposited as a credit to the project. Therefore, the disposition requirements
of Subsection I were restricted to the revenues generated from the uses specified in that subsection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 9, 1938, Congress, with the passage of the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment to the Interior Department Appropriation
Act of 1939, altered revenue crediting requirements by providing that all of the revenues generated in connection
with any irrigation project, including the incidental power features, would thereafter be a credit to the Reclamation
fund. This provision excepted those cases in which law or existing contract provisions provided for a different use
of these revenues, such as reflected in the passage of legislation authorizing the establishment of special accounts,
specific revenue crediting directions, and/or revolving funds that govern the management of revenues from specific
projects. Additionally, the provision provided that when construction costs of the project that were allocated
to power had been repaid and the revenues from the sale of power were no longer required to meet contractual obligations
to the United States, the net revenues from the sale of power would be credited to the Treasury of the United States as
miscellaneous receipts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment protected existing contracts with valid direct revenue crediting provisions,
but removed the opportunity for future Subsection I application. The sources of the revenues covered by the Hayden-O'Mahoney
Amendment are all inclusive as indicated by the language of the provision (43 U.S.C. 392a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that during the years that the Fact Finders Act provisions were available, Reclamation projects
started to become multi-purpose in scope. Due to this evolution from single purpose (irrigation) to multi-purpose
(municipal and industrial, irrigation, power, flood control, etc.), the focus of project repayment no longer rested
entirely with the irrigators. The repayment of project construction was now allocated among the various water users;
municipal and industrial users and power facilities, as well as the irrigators. To further disperse the repayment
responsibilities, Congress deemed certain purposes, such as flood control, to be in the public's best interest and
as such made them nonreimbursable by the project beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The passage of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 provided the next major impact on the repayment of Reclamation projects.
Specifically, Sections 9 (c), (d)(3) and (e) introduced: (1) The 40-year repayment schedule as standard rather than
on the ``as requested'' basis of the 1926 Act; and (2) the concept of ``ability to pay'' (43 U.S.C. 485). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concept of ``ability to pay'' allowed the revenues generated from approved project purposes, such as power, to
be used to help repay the portion of the construction cost allocated to irrigation. This plan is implemented by assessing
the financial resources of the water users and assigning to them responsibility to repay that portion of the construction
costs allocated to irrigation on the basis of their ability to pay. The remainder of the construction cost allocated
to irrigation was assigned to other project users. In this way the legal requirement for a full return of the project
costs would be met. For example, power revenues in excess of the amount needed to repay the power component of project
construction may be used to make up the difference between the amount the irrigators were able to pay and the costs allocated
to the irrigation purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By introducing ``ability to pay'' Congress provided assistance to the irrigators that did not involve using revenues
derived from Federal lands as a direct credit to the water users. Thus, while the direct crediting aspects of Subsection
I of the Fact Finders Act of 1924 were removed by the enactment of the Hayden-O'Mahoney Amendment of the Interior Department
Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 1939, which directed that all revenues would be a credit to the Reclamation fund,
Congress did not abandon the needs of the irrigators. Indeed, the water users benefitted from the introduction of
the concept of ``ability to pay'' in the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are many statutes that authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into specific agreements for the incidental
use of Reclamation projects and project lands. These activities may take place on both withdrawn public domain lands
and on lands acquired for Reclamation projects either by purchase, exchange, or condemnation. In addition, activities
may be authorized for the use of project facilities or may address the sale or disposal of water. Generally those statutes
detailed the specific manner in which revenues generated by these incidental uses were to be distributed. The revenues
are funds of the United States and, as required by the U. S. Constitution, cannot be expended or credited other than
as Congress directs. In those instances where Congress has not provided specific crediting criteria, Reclamation
has adopted the manner of revenues crediting specified for other activities from authorized use of Reclamation lands.
Examples of the types of uses on Reclamation projects and project lands include:

gas, oil shale, gilsonite, sodium, phosphate, potassium, sulphur, and asphalt either on lands (specifically the
mineral estates) in the public domain, or on lands acquired for a specific project and administered by Reclamation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Townsites and Power Development Act of April 16, 1906 (43 U.S.C. 561) authorized the withdrawal of lands from public
entry to be used for the purpose of townsite lots in conjunction with irrigation projects (up to 160 acres). The lands
were then surveyed, subdivided and sold by Reclamation for townsite lots (43 U.S.C. 562).

Sale of land_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Reclamation has authority to sell land that is under its jurisdiction in several different statutes:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The Sale of Surplus Acquired Lands Act of February 2, 1911 (43 U.S.C. 374) authorizes the sale of lands acquired
under the provisions of the Reclamation Act that are no longer needed for the purpose for which the lands were acquired.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Sale of Surplus Improved Public Lands Act of May 20, 1920 (43 U.S.C. 375) authorizes the sale of withdrawn public
domain lands that were improved at the expense of the project for which the lands were withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Disposal of Small Tracts Act of March 31, 1950 (43 U.S.C. 375b) authorizes the sale of public domain lands withdrawn
for the construction of a Reclamation project that are in tracts too small to qualify as farm units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Methods of Disbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revenues disposition statutes governing Reclamation projects generally cover four primary methods of crediting.
These methods are: (1) Front-end or direct credit; (2) credit to the project or tail-end credit; (3) general credit
to the Reclamation fund; and (4) general credit to revolving funds or special accounts authorized by Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Revenues that are to be credited as a direct or front-end credit are credited to the reimbursable construction
costs of the project by satisfying all or part of the annual payment currently due from the water users. All revenues
in excess of the annual construction payment are to be applied against the annual operation and maintenance expenses
of the district. This relieves the water users of their current repayment obligation, in part or in its entirety, without
accelerating the repayment of the total construction debt. Section 4, Subsection I of the Fact Finders Act is the only
general statute with applicability at more than one Reclamation project in which front-end crediting provisions
are found. These provisions were conditioned on whether the district had assumed the operation and maintenance of
the project, or the Secretary of the Interior had granted this relief under the authority of the Omnibus Adjustment
Act of May 25, 1926. Subsection I allowed the revenues derived from the sale of project power, the sale or use of townsite
lots, and the leasing of Federal lands for the purposes of grazing and agriculture to be credited as a direct or front-end
credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Credits to the project or tail-end credits involve funds being directed to the Reclamation fund and applied to
the construction obligation of the project associated with the revenues. This method of repayment accelerates the
return of the construction cost of the project to the Reclamation fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) General credit to the Reclamation fund does not provide a benefit to either the project construction costs or to
the districts' annual obligations. When revenues are a credit to the Reclamation fund, the funds are not targeted
to be spent on a specific function or project, but are only available to be spent as directed by the laws that control
the fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) General credit to special accounts or revolving funds are created by Congressional authorization and relate
to specific projects or specialized activities. These accounts/revolving funds are maintained separate and apart
from the Reclamation fund and are managed in accordance with the legislation that authorized their creation. Project-specific
special accounts or revolving funds are: (a) The Recreation Account within the general fund of the Treasury was created
by the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1987. This account is a depository for recreation user fees or concession fees; (b)
The Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund is specific to the Central Arizona Project and was established under
the authority of Section 403 of the Colorado River Basin Project Act of September 10, 1968; (c) The Columbia Basin Land
Development Account was authorized under Section 6 of the Columbia Basin Project Act of March 10, 1943, and is specific
to the Columbia Basin Project; (d) The Colorado River Dam Fund was authorized under the authority of Section 2 of the
Boulder Canyon Project Act of December 21, 1928, and is specific to the Boulder Canyon Project; and (e) The Upper Colorado
River Basin Fund was established under the authority of Section 5 of the Colorado River Storage Project Act of April
11, 1956, and is specific to the divisions of the Colorado River Storage Project.

C. Immediate Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of the Inspector General (IG) conducted an audit of Reclamation's revenues crediting practices and made
recommendations for ensuring proper application of revenues received from the use of water project facilities and
lands. That office also recommended, in part, that inappropriate revenues crediting be discontinued. Reclamation
is currently in the process of implementing the recommendations. A review of repayment contracts and amendments,
and current Reclamation practices as they pertain to collection and crediting or disposition of those revenues,
has been accomplished. These rules are being published to establish guidance for the consistent application of revenues
received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 3, 1994. Four of the responses received were requests for copies of future rulemaking actions; two were
requests for more information about revenues crediting after a district has fulfilled its repayment obligation
to the Government; four responses contained comments specific to different methods of crediting. All of the comments
received have been reviewed and have been or will be addressed in either this proposed rule or in future rulemaking
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written suggestions or objections regarding
the proposed rule to the location identified in the Addresses section of this preamble. Comments must be received
on or before November 14, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 19, 1990, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families published an NPRM (55 FR 24899) requesting comments
from the public on proposed requirements governing the operation of Head Start programs serving infants, toddlers
and pregnant women. That action was taken to provide standards so that Head Start programs which serve the target population
could ensure the provision of quality service. We are hereby withdrawing that NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recent Head Start reauthorization legislation, included in Public Law 103&hyph;252, the Human Services Amendments
of 1994 (enacted, May 18, 1994) amends the Head Start Act to require, among other things, promulgation of new standards
for services to infants and toddlers and their families under the Head Start program. Specifically, the Human Services
Amendments of 1994 add to the Head Start Act a new section 645A on ``Programs for Families with Infants and Toddlers'',
which includes a requirement for the development and publication of standards on the new section by December 30, 1994.
In order to comply with this provision in the Act, we must develop new proposed requirements on which the public must
have an opportunity to comment. Therefore, it is necessary to withdraw the previous NPRM.

1. On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (FNPRM) in CC Docket No. 93&hyph;22
(released August 31, 1994; FCC 94&hyph;200) proposing changes to rules governing the provision of information services
through 800 numbers and pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement. The proposed amendments are intended
to protect consumers from apparently fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the provision of these
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission's rules governing interstate pay-per-call and information services were adopted in 1993 to implement
the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). The TDDRA requires that most interstate
information services must be offered exclusively through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access
code and generally prohibits the use of 800 numbers to provide information services. However, under the statute,
800 numbers may be used to provide information services pursuant to a presubscription or comparable arrangement.
In an effect to control potential abuses of the presubscription provisions, the Commission explicitly defined presubscription
as a contractual agreement between an information provider (IP) and a fully informed caller who agrees to purchase
information services under the terms and conditions offered by the IP. Nonetheless, complaints before the Commission
indicate that IPs are apparently charging telephone subscribers for calls placed to 800 numbers without ascertaining
that the subscriber who is charged is, in fact, the caller who agreed to purchase the service. IPs apparently read the
Automatic Number Identification (ANI) of the originating telephone line to charge the call to the subscriber to that
line without regard to whether the subscriber has placed the call. The Commission expressed particular concern that
such practices threaten the public perception of 800 numbers as being toll-free, a perception and reality that Congress
clearly sought to maintain through the TDDRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission thus proposed to adopt more stringent requirements governing the establishment of presubscription
arrangements and the use of 800 numbers to provide information services. Specifically, &sect;64.1504 would be amended
to state explicitly that the rule protects not only callers to 800 numbers, but also subscribers whose telephone lines
may be used to place calls to 800 number information services. In addition, &sect;64.1504(b) would prohibit the use
of 800 numbers to connect callers to any information service that is not provided under a presubscription or comparable
arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Commission also proposed to modify the definition of a presubscription or comparable arrangement contained
in &sect;64.1501(b) to require that such arrangements be established only with a legally competent individual and
executed in writing, unless charges are authorized to a credit or charge card generally accepted for the purchase
of consumer goods, entertainment, travel, and lodging. Section 64.1510(b) would be amended to prohibit common carriers
from billing subscribers for presubscribed information services without evidence of the written agreement. The
amendment would also require common carriers to address bills assessing presubscribed information services charges
only to the individual who entered into the presubscription agreement. Finally, carriers performing billing services
for IPs would be required, without exception, to separate charges for presubscribed information services from charges
for telecommunications services and to display for each information service charge: (1) The type of service and the
service provider's name and business telephone number; (2) the telephone number actually called; (3) the amount
of the charge; (4) the date and time of the call; and (5) for calls billed on a time-sensitive basis, the duration of the
call.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission recognized that these proposals would impose new burdens on both common carriers and IPs that have
not engaged in the abuses described above but, nonetheless, concluded that these burdens are outweighed by the need
to protect subscribers from bills for services that neither sought nor received. The Commission encouraged parties
opposing the proposals to identify and quantify, with specificity, any expected burdens and to describe alternative
means of protecting consumers. Finally, the Commission urged interested parties to discuss whether the proposed
rules adequately protect consumers or whether other measures are necessary to guard against deception and evasion
by IPs, particularly when an IP and common carrier are commonly owned or have close business ties.

6. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, the Commission determined that the proposals
contained in the FNPRM may have some impact on small entities due to the proposed requirement the presubscription
be executed in writing. Public comment is requested on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis set out in the
full FNPRM. A copy of the analysis is being sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
in accordance with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has received three petitions to list several populations of salmon comprising four biological species of Pacific
salmon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Oncorhynchus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) from Puget Sound and the Olympic Peninsula, WA, and to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (ESA). In accordance with section 4 of the ESA, NMFS finds that the petitions present substantial scientific
information indicating that listings may be warranted. Therefore, NMFS is initiating a status review on these stocks
to determine if listing is warranted. Moreover, NMFS is initiating comprehensive status reviews for populations
of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout not presently undergoing status reviews in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and
California. Comprehensive, coastwide status reviews are already underway for coho salmon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
O. mykiss
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Species for which comprehensive, coastwide status reviews will be initiated are: Pink salmon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
O. gorbuscha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
O. keta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), sockeye salmon (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
O. nerka
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), chinook salmon (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
O. tshawytscha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
O. clarki clarki
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). To ensure that these status reviews are complete, NMFS is soliciting information and data regarding the petitioned
stocks as well as the five species in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4 of the ESA allows interested persons to petition the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) to add a species to or remove a species from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate
critical habitat. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that to the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after
receiving such a petition, the Secretary makes a finding whether the petition presents substantial scientific or
commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Petitions Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 14, 1994, the Secretary received a petition from the Professional Resource Organization_Salmon (PRO-Salmon
petition) to list nine populations of salmon comprising four biological species from Puget Sound and the Olympic
Peninsula, WA, and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The nine populations are identified as indigenous,
naturally spawning populations of (1) Hood Canal summer chum salmon, (2) Elwha River pink salmon, (3) Lower Dungeness
River pink salmon, (4) North Fork Nooksack River spring chinook salmon, (5) South Fork Nooksack River spring chinook
salmon, (6) Dungeness River spring chinook salmon, (7) Baker River sockeye salmon, (8) Discovery Bay chum salmon,
and (9) White River spring chinook salmon. Subsequently, the Secretary received two additional petitions to list
populations of chum salmon in Mud Bay/Eld Inlet and in Hood Canal, WA, from the Save Allison Springs Citizens' Committee
(April 4, 1994) and Trout Unlimited (May 23, 1994), respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, makes a finding that the petition presents substantial scientific
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted based on the criteria specified in 50 CFR 424.14(b)(2),
and based on evidence presented in the petition that the petitioned populations may qualify as ``species'' under
the ESA in accordance with NMFS' ``Policy on Applying the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act to
Pacific Salmon'' (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991). Under section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA, this finding requires that
a review of the status of the petitioned stocks be conducted to determine if the action is warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Systematic Approach for Comprehensive Status Reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
During the past 15 months, NMFS has received nine petitions requesting ESA protection for various population segments
of all seven species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oncorhynchus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 found in North America. NMFS has determined that all of these petitions, including those for the 10 Puget Sound populations
covered by this document, present substantial scientific information indicating that listings may be warranted.
However, there are also indications that declines in abundance (and local extinctions) of Pacific salmon and anadromous
trout have occurred over broad geographic areas (e.g., Nehlsen 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1991). Furthermore, experience gained from Pacific salmon status reviews conducted by NMFS during the past 3 years
has made it clear that determining the geographic boundaries and biological status of distinct population segments
generally requires assessing populations and habitats occurring outside the range covered by specific petitions.
For this reason, NMFS has initiated comprehensive, coastwide status reviews for two species_steelhead (58 FR 29390,
May 20, 1993; 59 FR 27527, May 27, 1994) and coho salmon (58 FR 57770, October 27, 1993) in order to more accurately and
efficiently determine the geographic boundaries and status of distinct population segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS believes it is now prudent to initiate comprehensive status reviews for the remaining species of Pacific salmon
and anadromous trout in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. These comprehensive reviews will allow NMFS
to conduct a more thorough assessment of the ecological and genetic diversity of west coast salmon populations, and
to identify the geographic extent and biological status of populations representing substantial components of
the overall diversity of the biological species. This systematic evaluation will allow NMFS to accomplish the major
goal of the ESA_to conserve the diversity of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit.

In order for NMFS to concentrate efforts towards completion of comprehensive status reviews by the above dates, 1-year
findings for the individual petitoned stocks, due in March, April, and May, 1995, may be delayed. However, NMFS will
complete status reviews for the species identified in the above petitions as soon as possible and will thereafter
promptly propose listings for any species that are found to warrant protection under the ESA. While findings on petitioned
Puget Sound stocks could be delayed, NMFS believes that the comprehensive approach will provide a more thorough and
accurate assessment of the status and risks to anadromous salmonids throughout their ranges in California, Washington,
Oregon, and Idaho.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has elected to complete the status review for sea-run cutthroat trout last because existing scientific information
regarding this species' life history and population status is extremely scarce. NMFS anticipates that valuable
information for assessing the health of this species will be forthcoming from studies being conducted by the United
States Forest Service and Oregon State University. However, due to the broad geographic scope of these studies (Alaska
to northern California), it will probably be at least 1 year before information is compiled and evaluated in a manner
that will facilitate NMFS' ESA determinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Listing Factors and Basis for Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, a species can be determined to be endangered or threatened for any of the following
reasons: (1) Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization
for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) inadequacy of
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Listing
determinations are made solely on the best scientific and commercial data available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Biological Information Solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that the review is complete and is based on the best available scientific and commercial data, NMFS is soliciting
information and comments concerning (1) whether or not any stock qualifies as a ``species'' under the ESA in accordance
with NMFS' policy (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991), and (2) whether or not any stock is endangered or threatened based
on the above listing criteria. Specifically, NMFS is soliciting information on the petitioned stocks. In general,
NMFS is soliciting information on pink, chum, sockeye, and chinook salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout in the following
areas: Physical and biological features of freshwater habitat; life history patterns of juvenile and adult fish,
including age structure and migration patterns; meristic, morphometric, and genetic studies; disease epizootiology;
population abundance and trends in abundance over time; influence of historical and present hatchery fish releases
on naturally spawning stocks; and separation of hatchery and natural salmon/trout escapement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the compilation of existing information, NMFS will expand its Pacific Salmon Biological Technical
Committees' (PSBTC) meetings in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California to include discussions of all species
of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout. The PSBTCs will provide NMFS with access to experts having a working knowledge
of salmonid populations and will ensure that an accurate and complete administrative record is developed for each
species. All meetings will be open to the public; interested parties should contact NMFS (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for information regarding locations and times of upcoming PSBTC meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the determination to list a species is based solely on the basis of the best available scientific and
commercial information regarding a species' status without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such
a determination (50 CFR 424.11(b)). Due to the broad scope of the species status reviews identified in this action,
NMFS will attempt to consider information submitted after the comment period (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). However, information must be received no later than 60 days before the proposed scheduled completion date (except
for coho salmon) given in this document to allow NMFS sufficient time to review the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS is also requesting information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for all stocks of pink, chum, sockeye,
and chinook salmon and sea-run cutthroat trout in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. Areas that include
the physical and biological features essential to the recovery of the species should be identified. Areas outside
the present distribution should also be identified if such areas are essential to the recovery of the species. Essential
features should include, but are not limited to: (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;
(2) food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter;
(4) sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring; and generally, (5) habitats that are protected from
disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For areas potentially qualifying as critical habitat, NMFS is requesting information describing (1) the activities
that affect the area or could be affected by the designation, and (2) the economic costs and benefits of additional
requirements of management measures likely to result from the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic cost to be considered in the critical habitat designations under the ESA is the probable economic impact
of the [critical habitat] designation upon proposed or ongoing activities (50 CFR 424.19). NMFS must consider the
incremental costs specifically resulting from a critical habitat designation that are above the economic effects
attributable to listing the species. Economic effects attributable to listing include actions resulting from section
7 consultations under the ESA to avoid jeopardy to the species and from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the
ESA. Comments concerning economic impacts should distinguish the costs of listing from the incremental costs that
can be directly attributed to the designation of specific areas as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data, information, and comments should include: (1) Supporting documentation such as maps, bibliographic references,
or reprints of pertinent publications; and (2) the commentor's name, address, and association, institution, or
business.

NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the
Gulf of Mexico (FMP). This rule would increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp harvested from the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico and would eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF)
for royal red shrimp from that area. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to the existing regulations implementing
the FMP that would clarify and conform them to current standards and enhance enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR parts 611 and 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the FMP specifies a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and optimum yield (OY) for royal red shrimp of 392,000
lb (177.8 mt) and estimates the domestic annual harvest (DAH) at 246,036 lb (111.6 mt). All weights are tail weights.
As specified in section 201(d) of the Magnuson Act, the difference between OY and DAH, 145,964 lb (66.2 mt), must be
set aside as TALFF. As a result, the domestic quota for royal red shrimp is 246,036 lb (111.6 mt) and the domestic fishery
must be closed when it reaches that level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 7 would increase the domestic quota of royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico EEZ to 431,200 lb (195.6 mt),
which is 110 percent of the current MSY. The Council considers this level of harvest to be conservative based on the
present estimate of MSY. Amendment 7 explains that the data for determining MSY are sparse (limited recent catch and
effort data), but that the current MSY is based upon the best available scientific information. The FMP indicates
that MSY falls within a range of values between 352,000 lb and 650,000 lb, and provides a single point estimate at the
lower end of this range of 392,000 lb (177.8 mt). Considering the MSY estimate, the Council believes that establishing
the domestic quota at the level of MSY plus 10 percent represents a biologically conservative harvest level. Amendment
7 explains that the Council intends to monitor catch and effort data and adjust MSY and OY as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Amendment 7, as received from the Council, did not contain an explicit statement of the Council's intent to increase
OY to 110 percent of MSY, as is necessary to allow catch (domestic quota) at that level. To clarify the intent in this
regard, the Council sent NMFS a letter verifying that its intent in Amendment 7 is to increase OY to the level that equals
110 percent of MSY. Based on the Council's clarifying letter, this rule proposes an increase in the domestic quota
from the current 246,036 lb (111.6 mt) to 431,200 lb (195.6 mt) consistent with the increase in OY.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS is concerned that the proposed OY for royal red shrimp is established at a level above MSY. NMFS believes that this
may be inconsistent with National Standard 1 that requires conservation and management measures to prevent overfishing.
Specifically, NMFS is concerned that if fishery harvests were allowed at an OY level above MSY on a continuing basis,
the royal red shrimp stock may be depleted and could sustain adverse effects preventing it from producing fishery
yields at the MSY level over the long term. Amendment 7 indicates that the royal red shrimp resource does not provide
an annual crop as with other shrimp species, but is harvested from grounds believed to contain at least five year classes.
Also, this species does not reach maturity until 3 years of age. Royal red shrimp differ from brown, white, and pink
shrimp in that they are not estuarine dependent, but exist in a relatively constant environment in the deeper waters
of the Gulf of Mexico (100&hyph;300 fathoms) (183&hyph;549 m). Royal red shrimp are harvested from what are believed
to be at least five year classes, whereas brown, white, and pink shrimp are harvested from one or two year classes. Because
of these biological characteristics, Amendment 7 indicates that royal red shrimp are more vulnerable to overfishing
than other shrimp. Based on these considerations about the OY in relation to MSY and the resource characteristics,
NMFS specifically invites public comments on a proposed OY greater than the MSY.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the current TALFF for royal red shrimp was established in 1987, there has been no foreign harvest of royal red
shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. The annual domestic harvest of royal red shrimp has varied, but closely approximated
the current domestic quota in 1993, indicating to the Council that U.S. vessels have the capacity and intent to harvest
OY. Accordingly, Amendment 7 would revise the estimate of DAH to equal OY, the domestic quota would equal OY, and TALFF
would be zero. The OY, DAH, and TALFF for royal red shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico, as published on February 3, 1987 (52 FR
3248), would be revised to read, in metric tons, tail weights, as follows:

There are no governing international fisheries agreements that involve the catching of royal red shrimp in the Gulf
of Mexico EEZ and, under this action, there would be neither a TALFF nor a foreign national allocation for such shrimp.
Accordingly, no foreign fishing for royal red shrimp would be allowed in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ, and the provisions
of 50 CFR 611.62 concerning the foreign fishery for royal red shrimp would be removed.

Additional Measures in Amendment 7
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 7 would revise the definition of overfishing for royal red shrimp as exceeding OY (MSY plus ten percent)
in a fishing year. Fishing is to close for the remainder of a fishing year when the OY (MSY plus ten percent) is reached.
Given the lack of data to make a scientifically rigorous estimate of MSY for royal red shrimp, the Council believes
that defining overfishing as exceeding OY (or exceeding MSY by more than 10 percent) in a fishing year still represents
a biologically conservative level of harvest. Amendment 7 provides that: If OY is attained, the royal red shrimp fishery
would be closed; if MSY is exceeded in any fishing year, NMFS would advise the Council and closely monitor the catch
and effort in the fishery; and if MSY is exceeded in 2 consecutive years, the Council would convene its Stock Assessment
Panel to consider the changes in catch and effort and to determine whether the MSY estimate and OY should be revised.
Amendment 7 also proposes a framework measure for changing MSY and OY. Specifically, a revised MSY/OY would be effected
based on a recommendation by the Council's Stock Assessment Panel, approval by the Council's Scientific and Statistical
Committee, adoption by the Council, and implementation by ``Notice Action.'' Given NMFS' concerns about the proposed
royal red shrimp OY exceeding MSY, NMFS is equally concerned as to whether the revised definition of overfishing for
royal red shrimp is consistent with the national standards of the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. NMFS is also
concerned whether the proposed framework measure provides assurances of consideration of social and economic factors
and opportunity for public comment on a proposed change to MSY or OY. Accordingly, NMFS specifically invites public
comments on the revised overfishing definition and the proposed framework measure.

Amendment 7 also contains a definition of overfishing for white shrimp; procedures for revising the overfishing
indices for brown, white, and pink shrimp, as required by 50 CFR part 602.11(c); and specific actions to be taken if
overfishing for brown, white, pink, or royal red shrimp occurs.

Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS proposes the following changes to the existing regulations implementing the FMP that would clarify and conform
them to current usage and enhance enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In &sect;658.1, the purpose and scope of the regulations would be restated. In &sect;658.2, unused definitions would
be removed, the geographical extent of the Gulf of Mexico EEZ would be clarified, titles and addresses in the definitions
for ``Regional Director'' and ``Science and Research Director'' would be corrected, the definition for ``shrimp''
would be clarified, and the scientific name for royal red shrimp would be changed to conform to current standards of
the American Fisheries Society. In &sect;658.3, relation to other laws would be revised. In &sect;658.4, explanation
that a permit is not required to fish for shrimp would be restated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In &sect;658.5, the requirements for reporting by vessel owners and operators and by dealers and processors would
clarify that the specified information must be provided when requested. The current practice, whereby fishery reporting
specialists, as designees of the Science and Research Director, collect information by interviewing owners/operators
and dealers/processors would not be changed. Since these specialists are able to ascertain and record areas fished
with the required specificity, the requirement that fishing areas be reported to these specialists in terms of statistical
area would be removed and the definition of statistical area, including the depiction of the areas in Figure 5, would
be removed. Other changes in &sect;658.5(b) are proposed for clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;658.6, the requirements for vessel identification would be restated and such identification would be required
on vessels fishing for rock, royal red, and seabob shrimp. In &sect;658.7, the prohibitions would be restated and
prohibitions would be added: (1) Regarding placing material in the water or using fishing gear in a manner to obstruct
fishing or damage vessels and gear and (2) on making a false statement to an authorized officer. In subpart B_Management
Measures, all sections would be reordered and restated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The closure provisions for the royal red shrimp fishery, currently at &sect;658.21(c), would be revised to clarify
that a closure of the fishery would be effective on the date specified in the closure notice. While the effective date
of a closure is usually later than the date the notice is filed with the Office of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, such closure may be effective as early as that date. NMFS also proposes to clarify the provisions that apply after
a closure and add a prohibition regarding illegal activities after a closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Two names and two positions of aids to navigation used as points to designate the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, currently
at &sect;658.22, would be corrected to reflect the names and positions for such aids to navigation in the U.S. Coast
Guard Light List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closures of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, the area off the southwestern coast of Florida, the shrimp/stone trap
separation zones off the western coast of Florida, and off the Texas coast, currently at &sect;&sect;658.22, 658.23,
and 658.25, are stated in terms of ``trawl fishing,'' ``trawl gear,'' ``fish(ing) for shrimp,'' and ``trawl fishing,''
respectively. For uniformity and clarity, NMFS proposes to restate the closures, in each case prohibiting ``trawling.''
For the closures of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary, the area off the southwestern coast of Florida, and off the Texas
coast, the change in terminology is not substantive. For the closures of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones,
the change would ease a restriction, in that fishing for shrimp by traps would not be prohibited in the zones/times
in which fishing for shrimp is currently prohibited. In terms of gear separation, which is the purpose of the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones, fixed gear and trawling would continue to be separated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations at &sect;658.23(b)(2) prohibit intentional/willful interference with fishing or obstruction
or damage of a fishing vessel or fishing gear. The placement of this prohibition in the paragraph dealing with the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones creates an inference that it applies only in such zones. However, the proposed and final rules
that implemented the prohibition state that it was to apply ``in the FCZ'' (49 FR 20883, May 17, 1984; 49 FR 30713, August
1, 1984). The former FCZ (fisheries conservation zone) is now the EEZ. Because such interference, obstruction, or
damage is reprehensible wherever it occurs, NMFS proposes to clarify that these acts are prohibited throughout the
Gulf of Mexico EEZ. The inclusion of the phrase ``with intent to'' and the word ``willfully'' in the current language
regarding these acts significantly reduces their effectiveness_proof of intent or willfulness is difficult. To
enhance enforceability, NMFS proposes to remove ``with intent to'' and ``willfully'' and substitute ``knowingly''
in each case. Proof of a violation would then hinge on the placement or use of articles or gear that cause obstruction
or damage, such placement or use being other than by accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific procedures and restrictions for creation or modification of shrimp/stone crab separation zones to
prevent gear conflicts, currently at &sect;658.24, and the specific procedures and restrictions for adjusting
the dates of the Texas closure, currently at &sect;658.25(b), would be removed. The specifics for the shrimp/stone
crab separation zones apply to Florida regulatory agencies, the Council, and NMFS. The specifics for the Texas closure
apply to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and NMFS. In both cases, they were approved as management measures
in the FMP. However, they are not regulatory in nature; that is, they do not control the behavior of fishermen. Therefore,
their inclusion in the regulations is not necessary.

Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to publish regulations
proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time the Secretary has not
determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent with the national standards, other provisions
of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account
the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because possible increases in gross revenues for all Gulf
of Mexico shrimp harvesters as a result of this action are expected to be less than 5 percent and capital costs of compliance
are not expected to be significant. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule involves, but does not substantively change, a collection-of-information requirement subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act_namely, vessel and dealer reporting. The collection of this information has been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB Control Number 0648-0013.

Five zones are established in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ and Florida's waters off Citrus and Hernando Counties for the separation
of shrimp trawling and stone crab trapping. The zones are as shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3. Although Zone
II is entirely within Florida's waters, it is included in this paragraph and Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, for the
convenience of fishermen. Restrictions that apply to Zone II and those parts of the other zones that are in Florida's
waters are contained in Rule 46&hyph;38.001, Florida Administrative Code. Geographical coordinates of the points
referred to in this section and shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, are as follows (loran readings are unofficial
and are included only for the convenience of fishermen):

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS proposes North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) specifications for calendar year 1995. The
specifications would be used to calculate fees to be paid by participants in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish fishery,
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area groundfish fishery, BSAI area king and Tanner crab fisheries,
and Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska (Research Plan fisheries) to fund an observer program
to promote management, conservation, and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut, and crab resources
off Alaska.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Public
Law 102&hyph;582, authorizes the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare, in consultation
with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), a Research Plan for all fisheries under the Council's jurisdiction,
except salmon fisheries. On September 6, 1994, NMFS published a final rule at 59 FR 46126 to implement the Research
Plan. This rule requires that observers be stationed on certain fishing vessels and at U.S. fish processors participating
in Research Plan fisheries, including extending these requirements to the halibut fishery off Alaska. Observers
will be deployed for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation, management, and scientific understanding
of fisheries under the Council's authority. The Research Plan also establishes a system of fees to pay for the costs
of implementing the Research Plan, beginning January 1, 1995. The fees are based on the exvessel value of retained
catch from Research Plan fisheries. Additional background and rationale for measures implemented under the Research
Plan are contained in the preamble of the proposed rule published May 6, 1994, and the final rule, and are not repeated
here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is publishing these proposed specifications prior to the effective date of the final rule implementing the Research
Plan. This is necessary because of the requirement for public comment on proposed specifications for the fee collection
program, and because the specifications must be in place before the calendar year for which they apply. It also allows
affected members of the industry to be notified and for the fee collection systems to be put in place.

Annual Research Plan Specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 677.11 of the Research Plan regulations requires NMFS, after consulting with the Council, and, in the case
of observer coverage levels in the crab fisheries, the State of Alaska, to publish certain proposed specifications
for the upcoming calendar year in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and to invite public comments. These proposed specifications include standard exvessel prices, total exvessel
value, fee percentage, levels of observer coverage for Research Plan fisheries, and embarkment/disembarkment
ports for observers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS prepared a report, ``Establishing the Fee Percentage and Standard Ex-vessel Prices for 1995,'' for the Council's
consideration at its June 1994 meeting. The report contains details of the derivation of these proposed specifications,
including sources of information and assumptions that are not repeated here. In response to comments received from
the Council and its advisory committees, the report was subsequently revised to provide a greater breakdown of exvessel
prices and to reflect a revised first-year program. Copies of the revised report are available (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed specifications for calendar year 1995 are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard exvessel prices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard exvessel prices are used to determine the annual fee percentage for the calendar year and are the basis for
calculating bimonthly fee assessments. Standard exvessel prices for species harvested in Research Plan fisheries
are based on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Exvessel price information by applicable season, area, gear, and processing sector for the most recent 12-month
period for which data are available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the upcoming calendar year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Any other relevant information that may affect expected exvessel prices during the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 1995, proposed standard exvessel prices of species from Research Plan fisheries, based on best available information,
are as follows:

Note: The PacFIN data indicate that, in the BSAI, motherships and shore-based processors paid approximately the
same price for pollock during the roe season, but that motherships paid 17.4% less than shore-based plants during
the non-roe season. If a separate standard exvessel price is used for at-sea processors during the non-roe season,
the proposed price is $0.058. If a separate standard exvessel price is used for shore-based processors, the proposed
price is $0.072.

Note: If a BSAI pollock non-roe season price of $0.058 per pound is used for at-sea processors instead of the shore-based
processor price of $0.072, total exvessel value is reduced by about $13 million. The use of a shore-based processor
rock sole price of $0.072 throughout the year for rock sole deliveries to shore-based processors instead of the at-sea
processor price of $0.352 during the roe rock sole fishery reduces total value by less than $0.1 million.

Research Plan fee percentage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Research Plan fee percentage for a calendar year must equal the lesser of 2 percent of the exvessel value of retained
catch in the Research Plan fisheries or the fee percentage calculated using the following equation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

where:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
RRPC is the projection of recoverable Research Plan costs for the coming year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FB is the projected end of the year balance of funds collected under the Research Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OF is the projection of other funding for the coming year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
V is the projected exvessel value of retained catch in the Research Plan fisheries for the coming year; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPR is the percent (expressed as a decimal) of fee assessments that are expected to result in nonpayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 1995, the best estimate of RRPC is $15.4 million. FB will be $0 for 1995; because no fees will be collected in 1994,
no balance of funds at the end of 1994 will be applied against program costs in 1995. OF for 1995 is projected to be $2.6
million, consisting of $2.1 million from NMFS and $0.5 million from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. V for 1995
is estimated to be $692.7 million, as described under item 2 above. NPR is estimated at 2.5 percent. Therefore, applying
the formula above, the calculated fee percentage would be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
[100&times;($15.4 million^$0^$2.6 million)/$692.7 million]/(1^.025) = 1.9 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the calculated fee is less than the maximum assessable fee, the proposed fee percentage for 1995 is 1.9 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Observer coverage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 1995, observer coverage levels in Research Plan fisheries are unchanged from 1994 and are set out at &sect;677.10(a).

Embarkment/disembarkment ports. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For 1995, observer contractors and vessels required to have observer coverage arrange for observer embarkment and
disembarkment. NMFS is not involved in this arrangement. Therefore, specification of embarkment/disembarkment
ports for 1995 is not necessary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA is providing a listing of critical regulatory issues to be researched under the second phase of its zero base
regulatory review. These regulatory issues, framed as questions, resulted from a series of public hearings held
throughout the country during late 1992 and early 1993. The hearings were held to obtain information, views, opinions,
and recommendations on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) from representatives of the motor
carrier industry, the insurance industry, enforcement personnel, universities, and other interested parties.
The FHWA will be conducting a comprehensive literature search to identify completed or existing research studies
that will provide insight on these critical issues. The FHWA is seeking information from individuals and organizations
who may have conducted research that addresses the issues provided in this notice, who know about research that has
been conducted, or who can identify others who have completed or are in the process of completing research.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The concept of the zero base review is to take a completely fresh look at the safety regulations governing the interstate
motor carrier industry. The objective of this project is to improve the regulations so they: (1) Have a more dramatic
positive effect on safety and the reduction of accidents, (2) are more easily understood by the industry, (3) have
a greater performance orientation, and (4) are easier to interpret and enforce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first phase of this project was initiated in 1992 when FHWA opened a public docket and notified all interested parties
through the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 18, 1992 (57 FR 37392) that it would be holding a series of public hearings to obtain comments and recommendations
for improvement of the FMCSRs. Pursuant to the August, 1992, notice, and two subsequent notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 53089 and 57 FR 60784), 11 public hearings and 14 focus-group sessions were held throughout the country. In addition,
the public docket which opened on August 18, 1992, was subsequently closed effective April 1, 1993, pursuant to 57
FR 60784. This initial phase of the zero base project was completed in September 1993, with the development of a final
report, completed in three volumes, summarizing the recommendations received at the public hearings, the focus-group
sessions, and through letters to the public docket. Many of the critical issues provided later in this notice are a
direct result of information and recommendations received during Phase I. The final report, Zerobase Review of the
FMCSRs, for Phase I is available to the industry and the general public through the National Technical Information
Service in Springfield, Virginia (1&hyph;800&hyph;553&hyph;6847 or local 703&hyph;487&hyph;4650), for a nominal
fee. The access and report numbers are as follows for each volume: Volume I, Executive Summary PB94&hyph;100294,
Report No. FHWA&hyph;MC&hyph;94&hyph;002; Volume II, Data Analysis PB94&hyph;100302, Report No. FHWA&hyph;MC&hyph;94&hyph;003;
Volume III, Data Summary PB94&hyph;100310, Report No. FHWA&hyph;MC&hyph;94&hyph;004.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second phase of this project is currently underway and involves a literature search for existing research studies
that may shed light on the critical regulatory issues provided later in this notice. The FHWA will also develop a new
format and structure for the rulebook of the future during this phase. The second phase is scheduled for completion
in calendar year 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third phase of zero base, which will begin in calender year 1996, will involve the actual writing of the new regulations.
As the new regulations for the rulebook of the future are finalized, the FHWA will initiate the fourth and final phase
of the project, which will involve drafting and disseminating non-regulatory, user-friendly guides for specific
industries or segments of the regulated population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is seeking information from the public on these critical regulatory issues to supplement its planned literature
search effort to locate research data. Following are the critical regulatory issues on which the FHWA is seeking information:

the term ``gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight''? [see &sect;390.5] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. At what GVW or gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) should the commercial driver's license (CDL) regulations, alcohol
and drug testing regulations, and the FMCSRs apply? [see &sect;&sect;382.103, 383.3, 383.5, 390.3 and 390.5]

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Stikine and Chatham Areas of the USDA Forest Service propose to harvest 123 million board feet (MMBF) of timber
volume (net sawlog) from the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw area of the Tongass National Forest, and to construct 84.2
miles of road and one log transfer facility (LTF). The timber would be harvested from 94 units covering 5,860 acres.
The harvest units were selected from a unit pool of 186 units containing a total of 225 MMBF of timber volume (net sawlog)
over 10,904 acres. The roads associated with the proposed action were selected from a road pool of 174 miles for the
entire project area. The proposed action would offer timber in one or more sales. (A map of the unit pool, the proposed
action, and roads is available from the address provided.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project area includes Value Comparison Units (VCUs) 79 through 89 on the Mainland in southeast Alaska, encompassing
approximately 193,000 acres. VCUs 80&hyph;89 have been allocated by the Tongass Land Management Plan to Land Use
Designation (LUD) IV, emphasizing primarily commodity or market resources. VCU 79 has been allocated to LUD III,
emphasizing a variety of uses, both commodity and amenity, to provide the greatest combination of benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this project is to provide 110 to 125 MMBF of timber for harvest according to direction described in the
Tongass Land Management Plan, to meet the Federal obligation to make timber volume available for harvest by timber
operators, and to improve the timber productivity of the project area by harvesting mature stands of timber and replacing
them with faster growing stands of second-growth timber.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made is whether to make timber available for harvest and improve timber productivity in the Port
Houghton/Cape Fanshaw Project area while also providing a combination of recreation, fish, water, and wildlife
for the resource uses of society now and into the future. This decision will be made by Abigail R. Kimbell, Forest Supervisor
of the Stikine Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If timber is made available for harvest, the Forest Supervisor will also decide (a) the volume of timber to make available,
(b) the location and design of the timber harvest units and log transfer facilities, (c) the location and design of
associated mainline and local road corridors, and (d) appropriate mitigation measures for all alternatives in the
project area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A public scoping letter will be sent to all persons indicating an interest in the project by responding to the Stikine
Area Project Schedule or Chatham Area Schedule of Proposed Actions, or who otherwise notify the Stikine or Chatham
Areas that they are interested in the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw Timber Harvest project. Public scoping meetings
will be scheduled during the last week in September in the communities of Wrangell, Kake, Petersburg, Juneau, and
Hobart Bay.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS will evaluate a number of timber harvest alternatives ranging from a no-action alternative to harvesting
110 to 125 MMBF of timber. Action-alternatives are likely to vary according to volume of timber (110&hyph;125 MMBF),
the amount and location of roads, the number and location of log transfer facilities, the number and location of harvest
units, and the silvicultural methods applied to each unit. Each action alternative will be designed by selecting
units and roads from the unit pool and road pool, and each alternative will fulfill the purpose and need for the project
and will respond to at least one of the significant issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary issues include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Soils: Portions of the project area are mapped as rough mountainous land characterized by steep rocky slopes, icefields,
and glaciers. High soil hazard classes also occur in the project area. How will the alternatives be designed to protect
the area from landslides? What effect would each alternative have on the soil resources?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fisheries/Watershed: Harvest operations could affect water quality, sedimentation, and fish passage. Mass-wasting
of sediments from cut-and-fill slopes can deliver sediment to streams. Harvest adjacent to streams without fish
may increase water temperature in waters what would ultimately drain to Class I and Class II streams. How will fish
streams be protected from direct and indirect impacts caused by harvesting timber and building roads? What effect
would each alternative have on fisheries and watershed?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Wildlife: Several goshawks and their nests have been located in the project area. Mountain goats inhabit the rocky
mountain terrain. Marbled murrelets are well distributed in the project area and use the Sandborn Canal and Port Houghton
Salt Chuck for foraging. How will these and other wildlife be protected? How will travel corridors among high-intensity
use areas be preserved? What effect will each alternative have on wildlife?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Subsistence: A preliminary review of subsistence use in the Port Houghton/Cape Fanshaw project area has identified
eight subsistence resources (deer, harbor seals, salmon, fin fish, waterfowl, marine invertebrates, mountain
goat, and mammal trapping) by three different communities (Petersburg, Wrangell, and Kake). How will these resources
be protected either from loss of the resource or overuse due to increased accessibility that may occur from road construction?
To what extend will each alternative affect subsistence resources and use within the project area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Recreation: Recreation sites at the project area occur as natural, unmodified environments with little evidence
of human activity. Most of these sites occur along shoreline areas and include boating, camping, hunting, and fishing.
What affect would the change from primitive to semi-primitive roaded recreational opportunity have on existing
and future uses? How will the alternatives address future recreational uses while preserving the type of opportunities
used historically?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Cultural Resources: A total of 47 cultural sites have been documented at the Port Houghton project area through
field investigations conducted this summer. One site consists of well preserved artifacts that date as early as 10,000
years old. How will these resources be protected from timber harvest, road construction, and potential vandalism?
What effect would each alternative have on the cultural resources in the project area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Visual Resources: Timber management activities will alter the appearance and perceived visual quality of the
project area and vicinity. What type of mitigation measures will be developed to reduce impacts to the visual quality
of the area? What effect will the alternatives have on the visual quality?

PERMITS: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
To proceed with the timber harvest as proposed, various permits must be obtained from other agencies. Applications
for these permits would take place after the Final EIS is filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
not sooner than 30 days following publication of this decision in the Petersburg Pilot newspaper, published in Petersburg,
Alaska.

Both the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been requested to participate as cooperating agencies in preparation
of the EIS. The agencies and their responsibilities are as follows: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility
for approval of discharge of dredged or fill materials into the waters of the United States (Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act), and approval of construction of structures or work in navigable waters of the United States (Section 10
of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899); EPA has responsibility for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
Review (Section 402 of the Clean Water Act). Other agencies which will participate are as follows: State of Alaska,
Department of Natural Resources has responsibility for authorization for occupancy and use of tidelands and submerged
lands; State of Alaska, Department of Environmental Conservation has responsibility for the Solid Waste Disposal
Permit (Section 402 of Clean Water Act) and the Certificate of Reasonable Assurance (Section 404 of Clean Water Act);
U.S. Coast Guard has responsibility for Coast Guard Bridge Permits (in accordance with the General Bridge Act of 1946)
required for all structures constructed within the tidal influence zone.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so it is meaningful and
alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions (

435 U.S. 519, 533 [1978]). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the Draft EIS stage may be
waived if not raised until after the completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 [E.D. Wis. 1980]). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is helpful if comments refer to specific
pages or chapters of the draft environmental impact statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft
environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers
may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions
of the National Environment Policy Act in 40 CFR 1503.3 while addressing these points.

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance of the first budget period (12 months)
from February 1, 1995 to January 31, 1996, is estimated at $222,196. The total Federal amount is $188,867 and is composed
of $184,260 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,607. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $33,329 in non-federal
(cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $222,196. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof.

The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the White House Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) issued a preliminary
draft of its report, ``Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure,'' on July 7, 1994. Copies
of the report may be obtained by calling the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at (703) 305&hyph;9300 or by sending a
written request to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Box 4, Washington,
D.C. 20231, marked to the attention of Terri A. Southwick, Office of Legislative and International Affairs.

The preliminary draft, on page 134, stated that the Working Group would sponsor a conference to bring together copyright
owner and user interests to develop guidelines for fair uses of copyrighted works by and in public libraries and schools.
The draft further stated that anyone who wished to participate in the conference should request to do so by sending
a request to Terri A. Southwick. The participants have been chosen and notified. Every effort was made to ensure that
a wide diversity of opinion will be represented at the conference. Roughly equal numbers of participants were chosen
from owners of copyrights, educators and librarians. Those who requested to participate but could not be accommodated
due to the large number of requests are invited to attend this and all subsequent meetings. There will be an opportunity
for those not chosen to participate to make or submit comments and questions. All meetings will be open to the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White house Information Infrastructure
Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and
the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating
and implementing the Administration's vision for the National Information Infrastructure (NII).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure; A Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working
Group on Intellectual Property Rights'' represents the Working Group's examination and analysis to date of the intellectual
property implications of the NII, and includes the Group's draft findings and recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group's concerns about the role of fair use in the NII environment were expressed in the preliminary draft.
Guidelines for library and educational use of printed matter and music that were voluntarily adopted by diverse parties
and set out in the house and Conference reports accompanying the 1976 Copyright Act appear not to apply to the NII environment
and thus to require modification or elaboration to deal with digital works and on-line services. The initial meeting
on September 21, 1994, will establish the structure through which such modifications or elaborations may be achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group solicited written comments from the public on the preliminary report in a notice published at 59
FR 35912 on July 14, 1994 and gave notice of hearings on the preliminary report in a notice published at 59 FR 42819 on
August 19, 1994. The hearings are being held in Chicago, on September 14, 1994 in Los Angeles on September 16, 1994 and
in Washington on September 22 and 23, 1994. The written comments received, the testimony given at the hearings, and
any guidelines or recommendations agreed to by the participants of the ``Fair Use'' conference will be considered
by the Working Group in the Final Report.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission on the Social Security `Notch' Issue was established by the Treasury, Postal Service, and General
Government Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;393, September 10, 1992).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
BACKGROUND: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislation adopted in 1972 to provide for automatic cost of living adjustments (COLA's) in social security benefits
contained a flawed formula for determining benefits which resulted in higher benefits than intended. In 1977, Congress
enacted legislation to remove this flaw. The new law was effective for all beneficiaries born after 1916 and the resulting
benefit modification for those born for several years after that date created what has become known as the `notch'
issue.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Joint Advisory Committee on Nuclear Weapons Surety (JACNWS) was renewed, effective September 4, 1994, in consonance
with the public interest, and in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 92&hyph;463, the ``Federal Advisory
Committee Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The JACNWS will continue to provide expert advice to the Secretary of Defense and the Department of Energy on all matters
relating to nuclear weapons systems surety. This will include undertaking studies and preparing reports with recommendations
on national policies and procedures to ensure the safe handling, stockpiling, maintenance, and risk reduction methodology
of nuclear weapons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JACNWS will be composed of approximately four to seven members, to include both government and non-government
individuals, who are experts in nuclear weapons safety measures and techniques. Efforts will be made to ensure a balanced
membership, considering the functions to be performed and the interest groups represented.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
An independent agency within the executive branch, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) provides
advice and recommendations to the President and the Secretary of Energy regarding public health and safety issues
at Department of Energy (DOE) defense nuclear facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Broadly, the Board reviews operations, practices, and occurrences at DOE's defense nuclear facilities and makes
recommendations to the Secretary of Energy that are necessary to protect public health and safety. If, as a result
of its reviews, the Board determines that an imminent or severe threat to public health or safety exists, the Board
is required to transmit its recommendations directly to the President, as well as to the Secretaries of Energy and
Defense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's enabling statute, 42 U.S.C. &sect;2286, requires the Board to review and evaluate the content and implementation
of health and safety standards, including DOE's Orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating to the design,
construction, operation, and decommissioning of DOE's defense nuclear facilities. The Board must then recommend
to the Secretary of Energy and specific measures, such as changes in the content and implementation of those standards,
that the Board believes should be adopted to ensure that the public health and safety are adequately protected. The
Board is also required to review the design of new defense nuclear facilities before construction begins, as well
as modifications to older facilities, and to recommend changes necessary to protect health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board may conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, hold public hearings, gather information, conduct studies,
establish reporting requirements for DOE, and take other actions in furtherance of its review of health and safety
issues at defense nuclear facilities. These ancillary functions of the Board and its staff all relate to the accomplishment
of the Board's primary functions, which is to assist DOE in identifying and correcting health and safety problems
at defense nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This public hearing is being held to provide the Board with general public comments and views on topics related to the
fifth annual report to be submitted by the Board to Congress under 42 U.S.C. &sect;2286e (note) of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended. The Board's report must include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(1) an assessment of the degree to which the overall administration of the Board's activities are believed to meet
the objectives of Congress in establishing the Board; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) recommendations for continuation, termination, or modification of the Board's functions and programs, including
recommendations for transition to some other independent oversight arrangement if it is advisable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) recommendations for appropriate transition requirements in the event that modifications are recommended.''

The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance
Rules 10 CFR 600.7, it intends to award a renewal for Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;89ID12903
to the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). The proposed renewal would provide funds for a project to develop lightweight
(low density) refractory aggregates for use in a variety of high performance insulating (low thermal conductivity)
refractory applications. The project goal is the development of an alumina-based aggregate with a 30% reduction
in packed bulk density, with 50% of current crushing strength, and with costs not to exceed 25% more than existing alumina
aggregates. The original proposal ``Lightweight Refractory Aggregates'' was submitted to DOE by the Aluminum Company
of America (Alcoa) in response to Solicitation for Financial Assistance Applications for Refractory Materials
Research and Development No. DE&hyph;PS07&hyph;88ID12782. The proposed costs for completion of Phase III of the
project is $1,265,855 with a 20% cost share by The Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). The CFDA number is 81.078.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Region I Support Office, through the Golden
Field Office, intends to award additional funds for two additional tasks to be completed under an existing grant to
the Energy Efficiency Export Council (EEEC). The grant provided funding for a series of tasks related to export promotion
of U.S. energy efficiency products and services. The EEEC efforts are on behalf of and in collaboration with the Committee
on Energy Efficiency Commerce and Trade (COEECT). COEECT functions as the Federal Interagency Working Subgroup
on Energy Efficiency established by section 1207 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, H.R. 776 (EPACT).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The two additional tasks, which were negotiated with the DOE, Office of Technical Assistance (OTA), establishes
funding to place two specialists in financing of energy efficiency/demand side management projects at the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The specialists, who will be accessible to the U.S. Director at EBRD,
will help U.S. companies obtain financing for energy efficiency projects in Europe and the former Soviet Union. The
completion of these tasks should result in an increase in exports of U.S. energy efficiency products and services.
Total additional funding is $66,025.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Noncompetitive financial assistance to EEEC is in accordance with the justifying criteria presented in 10 CFR 600.
The DOE/OTA has determined that EEEC has exclusive domestic capability to represent and interact with the U.S. energy
efficiency products and services industry, and, is, therefore, uniquely capable to fulfill many aspects of the mission
established for the COEECT by section 1207 of EPACT.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Florida State Energy Office conducted several exercises, in the wake of Hurricane Andrew, to test the feasibility
of using solar power as an alternative electricity source in disaster relief. Photovoltaic cells were used to power
communication devices, refrigerators for cooling vaccines, security lights, etc. The Florida Energy Office, having
already performed such exercises, is aptly qualified to implement the proposed study. Programmatic evaluation
has shown that such exercises are highly feasible with a high probability for success. The Department of Energy has
interest in further developments and studies relating to the use of solar energy in disaster relief. The published
results, which will be an available resource to a variety of organizations and agencies, will support the use of solar
energy as a renewable energy resource.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposed award is for the National Academy of Sciences to coordinate the National Research Council's
advice to the federal government on solid earth science issues. The board will identify opportunities for advancing
basic research and understanding, report on application of earth sciences in such areas as disaster mitigation and
resource utilization and analyze scientific underpinnings and credibility of earth science information for resource,
environmental and other applications and policy decisions. The project period for the grant is three years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (B), and (D), the National Academy of Sciences has been selected
as the grant recipient. Criterion (B) is satisfied in that the NAS would conduct the proposed project using their own
or third party resources. In addition to DOE, various other federal agencies, including DOI, NASA, NRC, and NSF are
potential financial supporters of the Board's studies. Also, DOE/PETC will contribute only 6% of the total dollar
of the three year project. Criterion (B) is also satisfied in that DOE support of the NAS Board on Earth Sciences and
Resources will enhance public benefit. Specifically, benefit will result from the Board's studies in areas of overall
health of the earth science disciplines (and education of earth scientists) that are vital to the nation in maintaining
and increasing its capabilities to make wise use of the earth and its resources. Additionally, Criterion (B) is satisfied
in that DOE knows of no other entity planning to accomplish the above stated purposes. Criterion (D) is satisfied in
that, consistent with 41 U.S.C. 253, the National Academy of Sciences is a uniquely qualified (external) organization
chartered by Congress in 1863 to conduct studies in the science and art when called upon by any Department of the Federal
Government.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Geothermal Technical Development and Training Project will be one of the most significant national efforts for
developing and promoting the use of ground source heat pumps as an energy efficient and environmentally beneficial
method of heating and cooling buildings. This project will integrate research, technology transfer and training
to develop better hardware and software used to implement the technology, as well as the production of brochures,
case histories, fact sheets, articles and related media activities to promote the use of geothermal heating and cooling.
Advances in ground source heat pump efficiency and installation techniques, as well as reductions in installation
costs, make the cost of this technology comparable with those of competitive heating and cooling technologies, while
operating costs and energy usage are demonstrably lower. This is especially important for institutional and government
facilities faced with budget constraints and increasing utility expenditures. The DOE anticipates providing funds
in the amount of $295,000 for a project period of one year with possible funding, in varying amounts, for an additional
two years contingent on the availability of funds.

 The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Chicago Regional Support Office, announces that,
pursuant to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), its intent to award a grant to the Council of Great Lakes
Governors. The award represents renewed funding under DOE's Regional Biomass Energy Program. The goal of this program
is to build and maintain the capacity of state energy, forestry and environmental quality offices to responsibly
promote biomass technologies and the use of biomass energy in the seven state Great Lakes Region.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Council of Great Lakes Governors is responsible for the administration of the Great Lakes Regional Biomass Program
(GLRBEP). The GLRBEP has three basic components. A state grant component provides funds (with a 50/50 matching requirement)
to each of the states in the region to strengthen and integrate the work of state agencies involved in biomass energy.
The applied research and technology transfer component produces a series of technical reports in areas that have
been identified as being important to the development of biomass energy in the region. The third component is a long
range planning effort, with substantial involvement from the private sector, to identify activities necessary
to spur greater development and use of biomass energy in the Great Lakes Region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grant is being accepted by DOE because DOE knows of no other organization that is conducting or planning to conduct
this type of effort in promoting of the use of biomass energy in the Great Lakes Region. The project period for the award
is twelve months, expected to begin September 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $730,000.

 conditions. A new direction will be pursued, prompted by unexpected findings in recent experiments at IIT related
to cathode dissolution in the MCFC. These findings indicate spalling of nickel and dissolution of spalled nickel
or nickel oxide particles during oxidation of nickel foil and wire. Spalling and dissolutions are relevant to understanding
the long-term shorting phenomena in MCFC cells or stacks. A third objective is to carry out systematic measurements
on the solubility of the major structural alloy components (as oxides) in various compositions of carbonate.

Non-competitive Financial Assistance is warranted based on USEA's exclusive capability to conduct the conference
successfully. Furthermore, private sector funding will finance the majority of conference expenses. DOE funding
on a non-competitive basis will enhance the public benefit to be derived from the conference. DOE knows of no other
entity who is planning to conduct a similar conference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of improved solar water
heating technologies for use in buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of wide commercialization of solar water heating systems.
Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual
national energy consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for the Grant is estimated at $25,000 and the anticipated
period of performance is twelve (12) months.

The National Security Archive (NSA) filed an Appeal from a determination issued to it on March 18, 1994 by the Office
of Resource Management (ORM), Office of Policy, Planning, and Program Management of the Department of Energy which
denied a request for information it had filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The request sought information
concerning the export of 4.3 tons of heavy water from the U.S. to Israel in 1963. The ORM stated that it did not possess
any responsive documents, and the Appeal challenged the adequacy of the search. In considering the Appeal, the DOE
found that NSA's FOIA request may not have been subjected to a search sufficiently thorough and conscientious to meet
the established standard of reasonableness. Accordingly, the Appeal was granted and remanded to the FOI Branch for
further action.

Carson Petroleum Co. (Carson) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.''
In considering Carson's request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a gross inequity or serious hardship.
On March 10, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied.
No Notice of Objection to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed within the prescribed time period. Therefore,
the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Carson's Application for Exception.

Friendly Service Stations, Inc. (Friendly) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;82B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales
Report.'' Friendly showed that it had been forced by financial difficulties to reduce its staff to such an extent that
complying with the reporting requirement would impose an inordinate burden on the firm. DOE therefore determined
that exception relief should be granted. Friendly hopes that its current difficulties will prove temporary. The
exception relief granted will therefore be effective for a period of nineteen months, ending April 30, 1995. If Friendly
wishes to receive continued exemption from filing requirements after that time, it must then reapply with the DOE.
Accordingly, the Application was granted in part.

Notice of Objections to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE within
the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Raymer's
Application for Exception.

Rockford Grain Growers (Rockford) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales
Report.'' In considering this request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a serious hardship, gross
inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens arising from this filing requirement. On February 10, 1994, the DOE issued
a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. A Notice of Objections (Objections)
to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE on March 14, 1994. In the
Objections, Rockford submitted additional information which demonstrated that the firm's precarious financial
situation was exacerbated by the requirement to file EIA&hyph;782B. Since Rockford demonstrated in its Objections
that it was experiencing an unfair distribution of burdens, the DOE issued a Decision and Order, granting Rockford's
Application for Exception.

Hunt Oil Co. filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the requirement to file Form EIA&hyph;782B
in which the firm sought relief from filing the form. In considering the request, the DOE found that interim exception
relief was necessary to alleviate a serious hardship to the reporting firm. Accordingly, interim exception relief
was granted. Although the reporting requirement did not create the hardship, it aggravated the situation faced by
Hunt.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refund filed on behalf of ASARCO Incorporated_Ray
Unit and ASARCO Incorporated in the crude oil special refund proceeding being disbursed by the DOE under 10 C.F.R.
Part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claims were meritorious and granted a refund of $175,157. However,
the DOE denied a portion of the claim, because it was based on gallons of petroleum products covered by price escalator
clauses. The DOE also denied a Motion for Discovery filed by a consortium of States and two Territories and rejected
their challenge to the claim. The DOE denied the States' Objections, finding that the industry-wide econometric
data submitted by the States did not rebut the presumption that the Applicant was injured by the crude oil overcharges.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order approving a Motion for Modification of a previously-approved second-stage refund
plan filed by the State of Idaho (Idaho). In its Motion, Idaho requested the authority to use $175,096.29 of its uncommitted
Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) second-stage refund monies to fund four projects in Idaho's State Energy Conservation
Program. The DOE affirmed the timely restitutionary benefits of the plan to promote the efficient use to energy in
Idaho. The DOE also identified the proposed recipients of those benefits (the people of Idaho) as a substantial segment
of injured consumers of refined petroleum products. The Idaho plan was thus found to satisfy the criteria for a second-stage
refund restitutionary program. Accordingly, Idaho's Motion for Modification was approved.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Reconsideration filed by R.W. Dental, the owner of Dental's
Automotive Center (Dental's), in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Mr. Dental's refund application had
been denied because the DOE determined that the business was not a purchaser of Texaco products, but a consignee of
an independent Texaco distributor. In the Motion, Mr. Dental demonstrated that, because the per gallon margin Dental's
received for sales of Texaco products fluctuated, the business was susceptible to Texaco price increases and market
pressures. Accordingly, the DOE granted Mr. Dental a total refund of $13,908 under the medium-range presumption
of injury.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying an Application for Refund filed by Mr. William E. Davidson on behalf of Houston
&amp; Davidson Texaco in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. The DOE found that the applicant had not shown
that he had had any ownership interest in the outlet located at 300 N. Euclid St., Fullerton, California, either as
a partner or otherwise, and therefore concluded that he was not eligible for a refund based on the purchases made by
that outlet.

Jack Fensterheim on behalf of Kelly's Texaco (Case No. RF321&hyph;19308) requesting refunds based on purchases
of Texaco petroleum products. Each applicant estimated that he purchased 32,000 gallons of Texaco motor gasoline
each month he was in business, and requested that his refund be based on this estimate. In considering this request,
the DOE found that this estimate was not reliable, since it was based solely on the applicants' recollection of the
size and frequency of gasoline deliveries. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order denying the Applications
for Refund filed by Jerry Mittler and Jack Fensterheim.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refund filed on behalf of Wathke's Interstate
Texaco (Wathke) and Haak's Texaco (Haak) in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Both applications were postmarked
after the February 28, 1994 deadline for submitting applications in the Texaco proceeding. The applicant's representative,
Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI), argued that Wathke's application should be considered as filed timely because Wathke
mailed RRI its application in an envelope postmarked February 24, 1994 and that RRI did not receive Wathke's application
until March 2, 1994. RRI argued that Haak's application should be considered timely because Haak mailed material
needed to complete its application to the wrong address. The DOE held that, with respect to Wathke, it was immaterial
that its application was delayed in its transmission to RRI since Wathke itself elected to send its application to
RRI by mail instead of sending it to the DOE directly, and that RRI could not be considered an agent of the DOE for purposes
of satisfying the deadline. In addition, the DOE held that Haak's negligence in sending information to the wrong address
was not a sufficient excuse to justify its late application. Because Wathke's and Haak's applications were filed
after the February 28 deadline and no equitable considerations existed in excusing their lateness, the DOE dismissed
both applications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the week of July 4 through July 8, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to
applications for refund or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Motion for Reconsideration that Jimmy Canterbery, the owner of Canterbery's
Texaco, filed in the Texaco refund proceeding. Mr. Canterbery had previously filed an Application for Refund that
was dismissed in July 1972 because of his failure to provide motor gasoline purchase information necessary to support
his refund claim. In his reconsideration request, which was filed in June 1994, Mr. Canterbery included purchase
information. However, this information was submitted more than three months after the final filing deadline in the
Texaco proceeding and almost two years after the dismissal letter. Since Mr. Canterbery did not present any reason
for the delay, the DOE determined that there was no compelling reason to reopen the refund proceeding to accept his
claim. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration was dismissed.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting two second-stage refund applications and a Motion for Modification filed
by the State of California. In its applications and Motion for Modification, California requested a total of $1,273,646
of new Time Oil Co. and National Helium Corp. second-stage refund monies as well as approval to use $144,142 of previously
allocated Charter Co. monies to fund four projects intended to reduce single-occupant motor vehicle travel, traffic
congestion and fuel consumption. The DOE affirmed the timely restitutionary benefits of the state's plan for the
funds, and identified the proposed recipients of those benefits (the people of California) as a substantial segment
of injured consumers of refined petroleum products. The California plan was thus found to satisfy the criteria for
a second-stage refund restitutionary program. Accordingly, California's Applications for Refund and Motion for
Modification were granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. a complete copy of the Federal income tax return(s) for the applicant and its affiliates for the past two years (calendar

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. If the applicant claims a preference as a business owned by members of a minority group(s) and/or women, indicate
the gender of the individuals listed in response to Questions 1 and 2, and indicate the minority group(s) of which the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant. A business owned by members of minority groups and/or women is one in which minorities and/or
women who are U.S. citizens have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and 50.1 percent controlling interest in the

that is 100 percent of the partnership equity, or an entity that is 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or
women who are U.S. citizens. The interests of minorities and women are to be calculated on a fully-diluted basis; agreements
such as stock options and convertible debentures shall be considered to have a present effect on the power to control
an entity and shall be treated as if the rights thereunder already have been fully exercised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise specified above, the information submitted must be current as of the filing date of the applicant's
Form 175 application. Any changes since that date shall also be disclosed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Respondent shall divest the Assets To Be Divested only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval
of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture
of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continued use of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies

(6) months of such repossession. If Respondent has not redivested such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II

action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude
the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including
a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to &sect;5(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

to comply with this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any
delays in divestiture caused by Respondent shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount
equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph II
of this Order.

approve more than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest to the acquirer or acquirers selected by Respondent
from among those approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's
duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses
incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account
of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondent
and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,

defend against such claims or pay the trustee's expenses, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses
incurred in connection with the preparations for, or defense of any such claim, whether or not resulting in any liability,
except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross
negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III.A. of this Order.

required by this Order.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Rite Aid Corporation (``Rite Aid'') under which Rite Aid would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic
locations in northern New England where they face limited competition. Rite Aid operates the nation's largest drug
store chain under the name Rite Aid Discount Pharmacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
person. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 30, 1994, Rite Aid and LaVerdiere's Enterprises, Inc. (``LEI'') entered into an agreement whereby Rite Aid
would acquire all of the stock of LEI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated,
would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as
amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in the following towns: Bucksport,
Maine; Lincoln, Maine; and Berlin, New Hampshire (hereinafter ``relevant geographic area''). The proposed Consent
Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors in the relevant geographic
areas where Rite Aid and LEI are direct competitors and here they face limited competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Rite Aid shall divest all
assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Rite Aid or LEI retail stores in the relevant geographic
areas. The divestiture of the Rite Aid or LEI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only
to an acquirer or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior
approval of the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy
business in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are
not limited to: Owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area;
persons previously employed by Rite Aid or LEI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Rite Aid
has not divested the Rite Aid or LEI pharmacy assets in the relevant geographic areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent
Order provides that Rite Aid shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy
assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Rite Aid is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance
with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and
every sixty (60) days thereafter until Rite Aid has completely divested its interest in the assets related to the retail
sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Rite Aid, for a
period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in the business
of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business of selling
prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Rite Aid will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Rite
Aid to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Rite Aid resulting in the
emergence of a successor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would permit, among other things, Roche
Holding Ltd. to acquire Syntex Corporation and its subsidiary, Syva, and would require Roche to divest Syva's drugs
of abuse testing (DAT) business within 12 months to a Commission-approved buyer, to operate the Syva assets separately
from its own DAT business pending the divestiture, and to obtain, for ten years, prior Commission approval before
acquiring assets or interests of any entity involved in the market for drugs of abuse reagent products.

B. In the event that the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal
Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. section 45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Roche shall consent
to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee
under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other
relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Roche to comply with this order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. or B. this order, Roche shall consent
to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Roche, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Roche
has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten
(10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Roche of the identity of any proposed trustee, Roche shall be
deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
the Syva Business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Roche shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the
prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee
all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III.C.3. to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
If, however, at the end of the twelve month period, the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that
divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or,
in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend this period only
two (2) times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to Syva,
or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request. Roche shall develop such financial or other information
as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Roche shall take no action to interfere with or impede
the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any delays in divestiture caused by Roche shall extend the time
for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed
trustee, by the court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission, subject to Roche's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum
price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer as set out in Paragraph II of this order, as appropriate;
provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission
determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or entities
selected by Roche from among those approved by the Commission. If requested by the trustee or acquirer, Roche shall
provide the acquirer(s) with the assistance required by Paragraph II.C. of this order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Roche, on such reasonable and
customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have the authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Roche, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business brokers,
appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are necessary to carry out the trustee's duties and responsibilities.
The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses incurred. After approval by
the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee, including
fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Roche, and the trustee's power shall
be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrangement
contingent on the trustee's divesting the Syva Business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Roche shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any claim, whether
or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III of this order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request
of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
required by this order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Syva Business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The trustee shall report in writing to Roche and the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish divestiture.

Appendix I
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Matter of: Roche Holding Ltd, a corporation, and Syntex Corporation, a corporation; agreement to hold separate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Agreement to Hold Separate (``Hold Separate'') is by and between Roche Holding Ltd (``Roche''), a corporation
organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of Switzerland, with its office and principal
place of business at Grenzacherstrasse 124, Basel, Switzerland 4002; Syntex Corporation (``Syntex''), a corporation,
organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of Panama with its principal place of business
located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94304; and the Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission''),
an independent agency of the United States Government, established under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914,
15 U.S.C. section 41, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(collectively, the ``Parties'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Premises
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whereas, on May 1, 1994, Roche entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger with Syntex Corporation (``Syntex'')
to acquire all the voting stock of Syntex (hereinafter ``Acquisition''); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, Syntex with its principal office and place of business located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California
94304, manufacturers and markets through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, the Syva Company, among other things,
drugs of abuse reagent products; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Roche, with its principal office and place
of business located at 340 Kingsland Street, Nutley, New Jersey 07110, through its subsidiary Roche Diagnostic Systems,
Inc., manufacturers and markets, among other things, drugs of abuse reagent products; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine whether it would violate any of the statutes
enforced by the Commission; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, if the Commission accepts the Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), the Commission
must place it on the public record for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance
pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the status quo ante of the
Syva Business as defined in paragraph I. of the Consent Order during the period prior to the final acceptance of the
Consent Order by the Commission (after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding
challenging the legality of the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the
Commission's ability to require the divestiture of the Syva Business and the Commission's right to have the Syva Business
continue as a viable competitor; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the purpose of the Hold Separate and the Consent Order is:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. to preserve the Syva Business as a viable, independent business pending its divestiture as a viable and ongoing
enterprise,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. to remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. to preserve the Syva Business as an ongoing and competitive entity engaged in the same business in which it is presently
employed until divestiture is achieved; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whereas, Roche and Syntex's entering into this Hold Separate shall in no way be construed as an admission by Roche and
Syntex that the Acquisition is illegal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, Roche and Syntex understand that no act or transaction contemplated by this Hold Separate shall be deemed
immune or exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything
contained in this Hold Separate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now, therefore, the parties agree, upon the understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the
acquisition will be challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, at the time it accepts the
Consent Order for public comment it will grant early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, and unless
the Commission determines to reject the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from Roche with respect to the
Acquisition, except that the Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Hold Separate, the Agreement
Containing Consent Order to which it is annexed and made a part thereof and the Order, once it becomes final, and in the
event that the required divestiture is not accomplished, to appoint a trustee to seek divestiture of the Syva Business
pursuant to the Consent Order, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Roche and Syntex agree to execute and be bound by the Consent Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Roche and Syntex agree that from the date this Hold Separate is accepted until the earliest of the time listed in subparagraphs
2.a.&hyph;2.b., they will comply with the provisions of Paragraph 3. of this Hold Separate:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. three business days after the Commission withdraws its acceptance of the Consent Order pursuant to the provisions
of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's rules; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the time that the divestiture obligations required by the Consent Order are completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To ensure the complete independence and viability of the Syva Business and to assure that no competitive information
is exchanged between the Syva Business and Roche, Roche shall hold the Syva Business as it is presently constituted
separate and apart on the following terms and conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. the Syva Business shall be held separate and apart and shall be operated independently of Syntex (meaning here and
hereinafter, Syntex excluding the Syva Business and excluding all personnel connected with the Syva Business as
of the date this Agreement was signed) and Roche (meaning here and hereinafter, Roche excluding Syntex and excluding
all personnel connected with Syntex as of the date this Agreement was signed) except to the extent that Syntex or Roche
must exercise direction and control over the Syva Business to assure compliance with this Agreement or the Consent

basis and, except as is permitted by this Hold Separate, such persons shall be prohibited from providing, discussing,
exchanging, circulating, or otherwise furnishing any such information to or with any other person whose employment
involves any other Roche business, including the drugs of abuse reagent products business, therapeutic drug monitoring
business and the Roche clinical laboratories business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and competitiveness of the Syva Company. Except for the Roche employee serving on the New Board, Roche shall not permit
any director, officer, employee, or agent of Roche also to be a director, officer, employee of the Syva Company. Each
New Board member shall enter into a confidentiality agreement agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions set
forth in Attachment A, appended to this Hold Separate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Roche shall not exercise direction or control over, or influence directly or indirectly, the Syva Business, the

In a proposed tender offer, Roche plans to acquire 100% of the voting securities of Syntex Corporation and merge Syntex
into Roche. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section
7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. section 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. section 45,
in the market for drugs of abuse reagent products. The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by
replacing the lost competition that would result from the acquisition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order provides that Roche shall divest the Syva Business within twelve (12) months from when
the Order becomes final. If Roche is unable to divest the Syva Business during the allotted time period, then a trustee
may be appointed to divest the Syva Business within a twelve (12) month period. If, at the end of the twelve month period,
the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time,
the time period for divestiture can be extended by the Commission, or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by
the court. The Commission, however, may extend this period only two (2) times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Hold Separate Agreement signed by Roche provides that during any period in which Roche possesses an ownership interest
in the Syva Business, these assets will be operated independently of Roche. Under the provisions of the Order, Roche
is also required to provide to the Commission a report of compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within
sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Roche has completely
divested its interest in the Syva Business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order also prohibits Roche from acquiring any interest in any other company that sells drugs of abuse reagent products
without prior approval from the Commission for a ten-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, the California
marketers of the calcium supplement product, BoneRestore, to possess competent and reliable scientific evidence
to substantiate the claims that any food, drug, or food or dietary supplement products will treat or cure any disease
or condition; would prohibit the respondents from using the name BoneRestore in a misleading way; and would restrict
the use of testimonial endorsements that do not represent typical results.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents RN Nutrition, a limited partnership, and George Page Rank and James W. Nugent, individually and as co-partners,
trading and doing business as RN Nutrition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This matter concerns claims made in respondents' direct mail and mail order catalog advertisements for their calcium
supplement, ``BoneRestore.'' The Commission's complaint alleges that respondents engaged in deceptive advertising
by making unsubstantiated claims that BoneRestore prevents, treats, and cures bone disease, bone ailments and their
related symptoms, and that the product is superior in this regard to other calcium supplements and/or estrogen. The
complaint also alleges that respondents falsely claimed to have scientific substantiation for these claims. In
addition, the complaint alleges that respondents made unsubstantiated claims that consumer testimonials appearing
in their advertisements reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public who have used BoneRestore.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order prohibits the respondents from
representing that BoneRestore, or any food or dietary supplement, food, or drug: builds and restores bone; stops
bone loss; helps persons with weak bones; treats osteoporosis; relieves pain; is superior to calcium or estrogen;
prevents fractures; straightens spinal curvatures; and that it provides any benefit in the prevention, treatment
or cure of osteoporosis, arthritis, back pain, or other bone ailments, unless respondents possess competent and
reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order prohibits respondents from representing that any endorsement of BoneRestore represents
the typical or ordinary experiences of members of the public who have used the product, unless respondents possess
competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part III of the proposed order requires respondents to cease using the name ``BoneRestore'' or any other brand name
that represents that such product has the ability to restore, build, or increase bone, unless respondents possess
competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiates the representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Part IV of the proposed order prohibits respondents from misrepresenting the existence, contents, validity, results,
conclusions, or interpretations of any test or study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Part V of the proposed order prohibits respondents from representing that BoneRestore or any food or dietary supplement,
food, or drug, will treat, cure, prevent, or reduce the risk of developing any disease, disorder, or condition, unless
respondents possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that substantiate the representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Parts VI and VII of the proposed order include safe harbor provisions allowing respondents to make any representation
permitted in labeling by the Food and Drug Administration for food under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act
of 1990, and for drugs under any tentative final or final standard promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The remaining portions of the proposed order require respondents to maintain materials relied upon in disseminating
any representation covered by this order, to distribute copies of the order to certain officials and employees, to
notify the Commission of changes in the business and employment of the individual respondents, and to file reports
detailing respondents' compliance with the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed consent order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen in the Matter of RN Nutrition (File No. 912&hyph;3145) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reasons for my dissenting vote in this matter are identical to those expressed in my separate statement in the companion
case, Metagenics, Inc. (File No. 912&hyph;3347), which is attached.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen in the Matter of Metagenics, Inc. (File No. 912&hyph;3347)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although I believe that certain of Metagenics' claims were unsubstantiated and, therefore, I would have been inclined
to support a more narrow complaint, I must dissent from today's Commission action because I believe that, on balance,
it runs contrary to the public interest. I fear that the breadth of the allegations in the administrative complaint
may convey the wrong message to the public and thereby discourage not only truthful and nondeceptive claims about
calcium supplements but, ultimately, their use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Commission has taken great pains in recent years to articulate and justify its standards for advertising interpretation
and substantiation. In taking this action today, I believe that the Commission has essentially ceded its authority
to the FDA on both counts. In short, I find today's Commission action overly restrictive and inconsistent with the
previously announced policies of the Commission. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Request for Comments: As part of an effort to inform the public, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) routinely announces
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the lists of chemicals for which it intends to conduct toxicological studies. This announcement will allow interested
parties to comment and provide information on chemicals under consideration for short- and long-term toxicology
and carcinogenesis studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Chemical 1. Riddelliine (CAS No. 23246&hyph;96&hyph;0)_2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats.
Riddelliine is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid found in plants of the genus Senecio in the Western United States. Riddelliine
and other alkaloids in these plants if ingested in high quantities can cause the death of livestock, or may contaminate
meat as a residue. Riddelliine may also contaminate commercial grains, milk and honey, and is found in some herbal
teas. In NTP 90-day studies Riddelliine was found to cause hepatic toxicity in mice and rats and hepatic neoplasia
in rats. Two-year carcinogenicity studies of standard design are proposed to determine the shape of the dose response
curve for carcinogenicity in rats, and further evaluate the toxic and carcinogenic potential in mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical 2. Urethane/Ethanol mixture (CAS No. 51&hyph;79&hyph;6/64&hyph;17&hyph;5)_2-year studies via dosed-water
in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. Urethane and ethanol are byproducts of fermentation and are commonly found in alcoholic
beverages and in many foods. Urethane has been recognized as a rodent and Non-human primate carcinogen, while the
International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that alcoholic beverages are human carcinogens. Risk
assessment efforts for urethane are complicated by information in the literature suggesting that the metabolism
and perhaps the tumorigenicity of urethane might be inhibited by the co-presence of ethanol. NTP 13-week studies
were inconclusive in demonstrating an effect of ethanol on urethane carcinogenesis. Two-year studies are planned
to examine this issue further. The studies will include separate groups of male and female mice exposed to urethane,
ethanol, or to several levels of urethane and ethanol in the drinking water. The studies will include an assessment
of the toxicokinetics of urethane, with and without ethanol, following repeated dosing. Studies of urethane DNA
adducts are planned to address the issue of the dosimetry of DNA alterations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Chemical 5. Dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (CAS No. 80&hyph;07&hyph;9)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice
and F344 rats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dichlorodiphenyl sulfone is a component of high temperature plastics. Specific production figures are unknown,
but the production of plastics made from dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and related monomers was over 1.5 billion pounds
in 1988. Very little toxicology information is available on this chemical. One study reported liver and cardiac lesions
in animals exposed to dichlorodiphenyl sulfone. A known inducer of cytochrome P450s, dichlorodiphenyl sulfone
was shown to cause marked hepatomegaly in NTP prechronic studies. Other studies have shown facile oral absorption
and a relatively simple metabolite pattern, as well as self induction of metabolism with repeated administration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Carcinogenicity studies with dichlorodiphenyl sulfone are planned with both sexes of rats and mice using the dosed
feed route of administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical 6. Elmiron (CAS No. 37319&hyph;17&hyph;8)_14-day studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elmiron is a pentosan polysulfate used as an experimental drug in the United States for the compassionate treatment
of interstitial cystitis, and used in Europe to prevent thrombosis and hyperlipidemia. The United States Food and
Drug Administration Nominated elmiron to the NTP as an ``orphan'' drug in need of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity
evaluation. Currently, 14-day studies are being undertaken with oral administration of the drug to rats and mice,
to determine if expected effects on the clotting system will be the basis on which to select doses for further evaluations.
Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity evaluations by standard designs are under consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical 7. Benzophenone (CAS No. 119&hyph;61&hyph;9)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzophenone is found in many consumer products, e.g., as a fragrance and flavor enhancer, photoinitiator, ultraviolet
curing agent, a polymerization inhibitor, and in the manufacture of pesticides and various pharmaceuticals. Benzophenone
and the structurally related compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone were nominated for study from a class of
ether compounds having widespread potential for human exposure. The carcinogenic potential of benzophenone has
only been evaluated by topical administration to female Swiss mice. No indication of carcinogenicity was reported.
In NTP 13-week studies, the oral administration of benzophenone was found to cause hepatocellular hypertrophy in
rats and mice, and evidence of cholestatic liver injury and renal damage in rats. Marked induction of hepatic CYP 450
IIB was observed in rats and mice. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies proposed for this chemical are of
the standard design, but with a stop exposure group using a dose which produced marked liver and kidney lesions in prechronic
studies. Toxicokinetic studies are also planned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical 8. 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (CAS No. 131&hyph;57&hyph;7)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in
B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone is a UV stabilizer used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical
and plastic products. Consumer exposure is likely greatest through its use in skin moisturizers and sunscreens where
products containing up to 6% 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone are permitted. In NTP 13-week studies by the oral
and topical routes, similar sites of toxicity were seen, primarily the liver and kidney, and effects on sperm density
and the length of the estrous cycle were noted. Other NTP studies indicated that absorption was good after both oral
and topical administrations, and major metabolites after intravenous administration were identified. Two-year
studies of standard design are planned for this chemical by the oral route of administration rather than a topical
one to provide information more comparable to that obtained with Benzophenone. In addition, the severity of the lesions
in the topical prechronic studies was limited, indicating that a rigorous evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the
chemical would be better achieved using oral administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical 9. Methacrylonitrile (CAS No. 126&hyph;98&hyph;7)_2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344
rats. Methacrylonitrile is an industrial chemical widely used in a variety of organic processes related to the manufacture
of polymers. It is a highly reactive unsaturated aliphatic nitrile found in cigarette smoke, and is known to liberate
cyanide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Methacrylonitrile has been studied extensively by the NTP including studies of 14-day and 90-day durations in rats
and mice by gavage. In addition, absorption, disposition, toxicokinetics, cell proliferation and developmental
toxicity studies have been performed. This chemical will be the subject of modeling efforts with physiologically-based-pharmacokinetic
modeling techniques, and is also recommended for 2-year chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of a standard
design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical 10. Acrylonitrile (CAS No. 107&hyph;13&hyph;1)_2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344
rats. Acrylonitrile is extensively used for the manufacture of synthetic fibers, resins, elastomers, rubber and
plastics. Estimated production is in the range of 30 million to 1.5 billion pounds per year. There is limited evidence
for the carcinogenicity of acrylonitrile in workers and Zt has been shown to produce chromosome damage in the blood
cells of exposed workers. Acrylonitrile has produced brain, stomach and zymbal gland tumors in 2-year studies in
rats, but has not been studied in mice. Brain tumors are rare chemically induced lesions in rodents. There is little
chance that the outcome of a mouse cancer study would change the classification of acrylonitrile as a rodent carcinogen,
but given the quantitiative differences in acrylonitrile metabolism in rats and mice, it is possible that clues to
possible critical metabolities will be gained from comparative studies in mice. Therefore, as part of the nitrile
class study, acrylonitrile will be studied in mice by the standard NTP protocol. Toxicokinetic estimates will be
derived by analysis of an acrylonitrile-glutathione conjugation product in the urine.

Chemical 11. m-Nitrotoluene (CAS No. 99&hyph;08&hyph;1)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344
rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nitrotoluenes are high production volume chemicals used in the synthesis of agricultural and rubber chemicals
and in various dyes. There are known differences in the patterns of metabolism of the chemicals with the ortho-isomer
undergoing a unique series of host and gut microflora-mediated reactions leading to an intermediate with high capacity
to bind to hepatic DNA and induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. In extensive NTP prechronic studies, the comparative
toxicity of the nitrotoluene isomers was determined. An unexpected finding was the presence of chemically induced
mesothelioma in male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene. Studies to elucidate the possible role of gut microflora in
the mesothelioma response demonstrated that microflora metabolism was not necessary for the mesothelioma response.
To further understand the carcinogenic potential of these chemicals and to relate this information to the extensive
existing knowledge of their metabolism, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies are planned with all three
isomers.

Chemical 14. m-Cresol (CAS No. 108&hyph;39&hyph;4)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cresols are monomethyl derivatives of phenol, and are found as constituents of coal tar, in various industrial
solvents and resins, and in some essential oils. Cresols are on the list of Hazardous Air Pollutants in the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 and on the Superfund Priority List of Hazardous Substances. There are no adequate published
chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of the cresols and this was identified as a research need by an International
Programme for Chemical Safety working group in mid- 1994. The NTP has performed comparative 13-week toxicity studies
in rats and mice by the dosed feed route. The isomers were found to exhibit generally similar patterns of toxicities,
with the o-isomer being somewhat less toxic than m- or p-cresol. Comparative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity
studies in rats and mice are planned for the cresols. The studies will follow standard designs.

2,4-Decadienal is one of the class of dienaldehydes that occur naturally in a variety of foods. They occur as byproducts
of the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids. Ingested lipid oxidation products and oxidized fats have been reported
to cause damage to the liver and kidneys, increased cellular proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract, and other
non-specific tissue injury. Certain alpha, beta unsaturated lipids, including 2,4-decadienal and 2,4-hexadienal
are known to react with DNA, and several researchers have suggested a possible link between lipid peroxidation products
in the diet and human cancer. 2,4-Decadienal will be studied in prechronic and chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity
studies in rats and mice.

Chemical 18. 2,4-Hexadienal (CAS No. 142&hyph;83&hyph;6) 13-week and 2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice
and F344 rats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The studies planned for 2,4-hexadienal are similar to those outlined above for 2,4-Decadienal.

Chemical 19. Dipropylene glycol (CAS No. 25265&hyph;71&hyph;8) 2-year studies via dosed-water in B6C3F1 mice and
F344 rats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dipropylene glycol is a component of antifreeze, air fresheners/sanitizers and is used as a stabilizer in cosmetics,
as a component in polyester, alkyd resins, plastics, as a plasticizer and as a solvent. It is a relatively high production
volume chemical with nearly 100 million pounds used in the United States annually. It was found to be of low to moderate
toxicity in NTP 13-week studies. Mortality, hepatocellular lesions including atypical foci and an adenoma were
seen in rats at the top dose. Findings in mice were limited to increased liver weights. Carcinogenicity studies of
a standard design are proposed for dipropylene glycol.

Chemical 20. Arsenic trioxide (CAS No. 1327&hyph;53&hyph;3) study plans are being formulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arsenic trioxide is a byproduct of copper or lead smelting operations and is used in pesticides, in the manufacture
of glass, pharmaceuticals and other industrial chemicals. Arsenic and arsenic compounds have been classified as
human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, but the demonstration of the carcinogenicity
of arsenic trioxide and other arsenical compounds in rodents has been difficult. Arsenic is a common water contaminant
and there is need for information on biomarkers of exposure for low dose risk estimations. For these reasons the program
has selected arsenic trioxide for study as part of an initiative to examine human carcinogens which have not adequately
been evaluated in rodent studies. Specific study designs are under development.

Chemical 21. Tamoxifen (CAS No. 10540&hyph;29&hyph;1)/conjugated estrogens study plans are being formulated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies on tamoxifen and conjugated estrogens will be designed to address several issues. Conjugated estrogens
are listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as human carcinogens causing endometrial cancer, however
these chemicals have never been adequately studied in animals. These chemicals find wide use in human medicine and
in skin care preparations. Estrogens are prescribed for prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and
are used as oral contraceptives. Tamoxifen is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist known to be effective in the treatment
and prevention of estrogen sensitive breast cancer. Tamoxifen also causes endometrial cancer in humans. Studies
are being designed to help characterize dose-response relationships and cancer risks for estrogen agonist and antagonists.

Chemical 22. MX [3-Chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2-furanone] (CAS No. 77439&hyph;76&hyph;0) study
plans are being formulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MX is a mutagenic byproduct of water and wood pulp chlorination and has been determined to account for about half of
the mutagenic potency of finished drinking water. The EPA has Nominated MX for carcinogenicity studies with the expectation
that the outcome could influence United States drinking water contaminant standards. Study designs are incomplete.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Assessment for the planning review of the Brown/Howe Dinosaur Area documents the analysis of four
alternatives for managing the area, including the Bureau of Land Management's preferred alternative. The planning
review area encompasses 5,457 acres of BLM-administered public land in the Cody Resource Area of the BLM's Worland
District in Big Horn County, Wyoming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The planning review is being conducted to evaluate the management needs and issues associated with the discovery
of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allosaurus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
skeleton in the review area. The discovery was made approximately 1 year after the approval of the Cody Resource Management
Plan (RMP) and a review of the RMP is needed to evaluate the adequacy of existing management decisions for the management
and protection of paleontological resources in the review area. Management actions being considered include designation
of the review area as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) and closure of the area to the staking and development
of mining claims and closure to entry under the land laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on preliminary analysis, BLM has established a temporary closure to the staking of mining claims in the planning
review area. As part of the planning review, BLM has collected information and conducted analyses described in this
Environmental Assessment to determine whether a long-term closure is necessary for the protection of paleontological
resources. Based on the results, the Cody RMP will be amended, if necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the discovery of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Allosaurus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 skeleton, the BLM completed a temporary management plan for the lands in and around the fossil discovery area. Protective
measures have been initiated and have been in effect pending completion of this planning review. This planning review
includes opportunities for public participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The steps followed for this planning review are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An interdisciplinary planning team described and analyzed the existing management in the planning review area
and described the affected environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 informing the public of known and anticipated issues and of opportunities for public participation and comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Public contracts and meetings were held for scoping and development of the preliminary issues and alternatives.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. With the help of the public, management alternatives for the area were formulated and analyzed and the BLM's preferred
alternative was identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The alternatives, including the BLM's preferred alternative, and their environmental consequences are described
in the EA and the EA is now being issued for public review and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A 60-day period will be provided for reviewing and commenting on the EA and for submitting protests on any proposed
decisions to be added to or changed in the Cody RMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The EA will then be revised, as necessary, and a decision record will be issued. If necessary, this decision record
will identify and include any needed amendment to the Cody RMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the public's input and analysis by the BLM interdisciplinary team, the following issues were identified:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Whether or not there is a need to protect important paleontological resources from being damaged by potential surface-disturbing
activities in the planning review area, including closure to and withdrawal from possible mining claim and mining-related
activities and from possible entry under the land laws (for example, Desert Land Entry). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Whether or not the area should be designated an ACEC with management emphasis primarily for research, public education,
and recreation, associated with the significant paleontological resources in the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four alternatives analyzed in the EA are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. No Action (continuation of existing management). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Designating an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) of about 5,457 acres with management emphasis on
protection of fossils for scientific research and public education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Designating an ACEC of about 5,457 acres with management emphasis on protection of fossils for scientific research
and public education, and with mineral location and land law withdrawals of the known fossil concentration area (120.9
acres). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Designating an ACEC of about 5,457 acres with management emphasis on protection of fossils for scientific research
and public education, and with mineral location and land law withdrawals of the fossil concentration areas and adjacent
lands (approximately 4,182 acres). The BLM's preferred alternative is Alternative 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating the planning review area an ACEC with a 120.9-acre mineral withdrawal under the 1872 Mining Law and withdrawal
from operation of land laws represents what the BLM believes is the best balance between the public land and resource
uses and environmental protection in the planning review area. The various impacts that would be expected from implementing
each of the Alternatives is also presented in the EA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the end of the comment/protest period, any of the decisions mentioned above or similar decisions based on public
comment would amend the Cody RMP at the time a Decision Record is issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the analysis of potential environmental impacts contained in the EA, it has been determined that impacts
are not expected to be significant and an Environmental Impact Statement is not needed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given of intent to prepare several wilderness management plans. This notice also constitutes the
scoping notice required by the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Description of proposed planning action: In accordance with Bureau of Land Management wilderness management
policy guidance, Wilderness Management Plans will be developed for six wilderness areas. Because several of the
areas share similar issues or are in close proximity with each other, the six areas will be covered by three wilderness
management plans: one for the Tres Alamos Wilderness, one for the Signal Mountain and Woolsey Peak Wildernesses,
and one for the Harquahala Mountains, Hummingbird Springs and Bighorn Mountains Wildernesses. An Environmental
Assessment of the impacts of the proposed actions and alternatives will be prepared prior to approval of each plan.
The plans will state policies, actions and monitoring standards to be used to maintain each area's wilderness resources
and will consider issues and alternatives identified through a number of public forums including scoping meetings.
The public is invited to participate in scoping meetings beginning in October 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Geographic areas involved: The six wilderness areas are in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern and south central
Arizona, located in Maricopa, eastern La Paz, and southwestern Yavapai Counties. Towns in the vicinity are Bagdad,
Wickenburg, Aquila, and Gila Bend. Distances from Phoenix range from 35 miles to the southwest, 55 miles to the west,
and 80 miles to the northwest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Types of issues anticipated: Wilderness values such as naturalness, solitude and primitive recreational opportunities
must be preserved. Use of these areas for developed public and commercial recreation, education, research, wildlife
and wild burro management, livestock grazing, mining and existing private rights will be assessed. Acceptable levels
of these uses as well as for primitive recreation will be identified. Appropriate levels of activity to administer
the areas, e.g., assuring public access, providing recreational facilities, signing, law enforcement, search
and rescue, wild burro removal, and fire suppression will be determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disciplines to be represented in the preparation of the management plans will include: Wilderness, Recreation,
Cultural, Wildlife, Range, Livestock, Wild Burro and Fire Management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The kind and extent of public involvement to be provided: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three public scoping meetings will be held to identify issues and opportunities for management of the six areas. These
will be held in Gila Bend, Wickenburg and Phoenix, Arizona at the following times and locations:

 These areas were added to the Wilderness Preservation System by Public Law 101&hyph;628, of November 28, 1990, known
as the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990. Management and use of these areas is directed by this law as well as the
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Wilderness Act of 1964. The area involved in this planning effort
include 8,300 acres in the Tres Alamos Wilderness, 22,880 acres in the Harquahala Mountains Wilderness, 31,200 acres
in the Hummingbird Springs Wilderness, 21,000 acres in the Bighorn Mountains Wilderness, 15,250 acres in the Signal
Mountain Wilderness, and 64,000 acres in the Woolsey Peak Wilderness. Areas and activities on non-wilderness land
adjacent to the wilderness boundaries may also be addressed in these plans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Service Company of New Mexico currently has a water service contract (USBR Contract No. 14&hyph;06&hyph;400&hyph;4831)
with the Bureau of Reclamation for an annual use of 16,200 acre-feet of water from Navajo Reservoir, in San Juan County,
New Mexico. The contract water is diverted from the San Juan River near Waterflow, New Mexico, via a weir and backwater
pumping system. Water is stored in a small reservoir at the San Juan Generating Station. The existing water service
contract was executed in 1968, amended in 1977, and expires in 2005.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Reclamation is the lead Federal agency to ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act for the proposed action. The Public Service Company of New Mexico has requested the Bureau of Reclamation to initiate
the environmental scoping process and prepare the environmental document. The Bureau of Reclamation is initiating
the scoping process now to allow sufficient time to identify and resolve (1) environmental concerns, and (2) any issues
affecting any assets held in trust by the Federal government for Federally recognized Indian tribes or individual
members of Federally recognized Indian tribes insofar as those concerns or issues are relevant to the proposed water
service contract renewal and extension.

Notice is hereby given that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering approval
under 10 CFR 50.80 of the proposed corporate restructuring of Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company (PP&amp;L),
the co-owner and licensee of the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2 (Susquehanna). By letter dated
July 25, 1994, Robert G. Byram, Senior Vice President-Nuclear of PP&amp;L, informed the Commission that the Board
of Directors has proposed a corporate restructuring plan to be presented at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled
for April 26, 1995. If a majority of the shareholders approve the plan, PP&amp;L will become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of a new holding company named PP&amp;L Resources, Inc. (Resources). PP&amp;L would remain as holder of the licenses
for the aforementioned facilities. If the plan is approved, the common stock of PP&amp;L will be converted on a share-for-share
basis into common stock of the holding company, and there will be no effect upon the management, operation, and financing
of the PP&amp;L nuclear facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80, the Commission may approve the transfer of control of a license, after notice to interested
persons. Such action is contingent upon the Commission's determination that the holder of the license and the transfer
of such control is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders of the Commission.

The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in Room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900
E Street, NW., Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, five representatives from labor unions
holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and five representatives from Federal
agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5348.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing
prevailing rates under subchapter IV, Chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel
Management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These scheduled meetings will start in opening session with both labor and management representatives attending.
During the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise
strategy and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matters discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably
impair the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matters being considered and would disrupt substantially
the disposition of its business. Therefore, these caucuses will be closed to the public because of a determination
made by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463) and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). These caucuses may, depending on the issues involved,
constitute a substantial portion of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annually, the Committee publishes for the Office of Personnel Management, the President, and Congress a comprehensive
report to pay issues discussed, concluded recommendations, and related activities. These reports are available
to the public, upon written request to the Committee's Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public is invited to submit material in writing to the Chairman on Federal Ways Systems pay matters felt to be deserving
of the Committee's attention. Additional information on these meetings may be obtained by contacting the Committee's
Secretary, Office of Personnel Management, Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, Room 1340, 1990 E Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20415 (202) 606&hyph;1500.

 On December 24, 1981, OMB approved an information collection proposal submitted by the Panama Canal Commission in
conjunction with a revision of its navigation regulations (35 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter C), and assigned it the control
number 3207&hyph;0001. The forms required by those regulations (which make up the collection of information) are
used to collect, from vessels arriving in the Panama Canal waters, information required for assuring that the vessels
are in compliance with Panama Canal Commission shipping and navigation regulations. The information collected
will be used for economic analyses, traffic forecasting, identification, billing, safety and sanitation purposes.
It is estimated that the burden (which varies widely, depending upon the nature of each vessel's operations) for cargo
vessels ranges from five minutes to four hours per response. The burden will be lessened for those vessels having the
capability of producing computer-generated cargo declarations. For passenger vessels, the range would be from
approximately two hours to thirteen hours. The utilization of computer-generated crew and passenger lists should
reduce by eight to ten hours the time required of a vessel like the QUEEN ELIZABETH 2, (the smallest ``passenger'' vessels
carry about 13 passengers and the largest, the QUEEN ELIZABETH 2, is capable of accommodating about 1,879). It would
be very difficult to provide a meaningful estimate of the total burden for each vessel since some transit frequently,
while others may transit only once or infrequently.

6(b)(5) of the Act in particular, in that it is not designated to permit unfair discrimination between customers,
issuers, brokers and dealers and in general is designed to protect investors and the public interest.

Amendment No. 1 to the proposal corrects a mathematical error in an example provided in the language of the proposed
rule change, and explains that the new late fee established by the proposal will be assessed to accounts that are in
arrears prior to the implementation of the new late fee charge. Letter from Joan Conley, Corporate Secretary, NASD,

II. Description of the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD proposal amends Part IX of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to establish a uniform and consistent methodology
for assessing fees for the late payment of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``NSM'') charges. The late fee will be applied
to all charges imposed by NSM that are past due 45 days or more. The late fee will be computed by taking the summation of
one and one-half percent (11/2%) of the amount past due for the first month, plus one and one-half percent (11/2%) of
the amount past due for any month thereafter, compounded by late fees assessed for previous months. For example, if
an account is past due $1,000 for 45 days, the late fee would be $30.22. This charge reflects a charge of $15 for the first
month past due ($1,000 &times; 11/2%) and $15.22 for the second month past due ($1,015 &times; 11/2%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new late fee structure will replace the existing structure (found in section H of Part IX of Schedule D to the By-Laws)
which provides that charges for Nasdaq Level 1 and Nasdaq/NMS Last Sale services which are past due 45 days will be assessed
a fee equal to 11/2% per months of the unpaid balance. For all other Nasdaq charges, namely, charges for the Nasdaq Level
2/3 service, Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (``OTCBB''), Mutual Fund Quotation Program, and Nasdaq Workstation
service (collectively referred to hereinafter as ``Nasdaq charges''), the late payment fee presently is equal to
10% of the amount past due for 60 days or more. By eliminating the current practice of using these two different methods
to assess late fees for various NSM charges, the NASD believes its operational efficiency will be enhanced and public
confusion concerning the NASD's late fee policy likely will be diminished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also will amend Section H of Part IX of Schedule D to the By-Laws to provide that the section governs fees
for the late payment of NSM charges instead of ``NASDAQ charges.'' This amendment reflects the merger, effective
June 30, 1993, of two of the NASD's corporate subsidiaries, Nasdaq, Inc. and NASD Market Services, Inc. (``MSI'')
into one consolidated subsidiary called The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. In addition, this amendment serves to subject
charges for services provided by MSI (the NSM after the merger) to late payment fees (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, SOES, SelectNet, and ACT charges). Currently, other than for Nasdaq/NMS Last Sale service charges, there is no fee
for the alter payment of service charges that previously were assessed by MSI but now are assessed by the NSM after the
merger.

III. Commission's Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5)
requires that the rules of a national securities association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable
dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the association
operates or controls. Specifically, by instituting a uniform and consistent policy for assessing fees for the late
payment of service charges, to be imposed as described above, the Commission believes the late payment of fees is reasonable
and equitably allocated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;34) is approved.

NYSE is amending its Rule 412, Customer Account Transfer Contracts, and its related interpretations in order to incorporate
into its customer account transfer process enhancements the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')
has made to its Automated Customer Account Transfer (``ACAT'') service. Presently, the transfer time for transferring
customers' cash or margin accounts is ten business days and is fifteen business days for transferring retirement
accounts. The proposed amendments will reduce the time period for transferring customers' cash, margin, and retirement
accounts to seven business days. This will be accomplished by reducing the five business day validation period for
accounts to three business days
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and by reducing the delivery period from five business days to four business days.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The rule change also mandates the use of an automated customer account transfer system for transferring mutual fund
positions where both the receiving broker-dealer and the delivering broker-dealer are participants in a registered
clearing agency which has such a facility.

Where both receiving and delivery member organizations participate in a registered clearing agency with an automated
customer account transfer system with residual credit processing capabilities, the rule change requires the members
to utilize such facilities to transfer residual credit positions which accrue to an account after transfer. Member
organizations already are required to transfer credit balances accruing in a transferred account within ten business
days after accrual for a minimum of six months following the transfer. This requirement applies to all member organizations
regardless of whether they utilize an automated customer account transfer system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule change also permits partial customer account transfers to be accomplished through a registered clearing
agency's automated customer account transfer system. Presently, partial transfers are accomplished outside of
the system. The time frames required by Rule 412 for transfer of entire customer accounts do not apply to partial transfers.
However, the NYSE states in its filing and in existing interpretations to NYSE Rule 412 that member organizations
are expected to expedite partial transfers of customer accounts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, two comments were received in support of the proposed rule change. One letter addressed only that portion
of the rule change dealing with the mandatory participation in NSCC's ACAT service.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The commenter noted that the ACAT service benefits broker-dealers and mutual fund companies, but the retail investor
is the ultimate benefactor of the process. The commenter also stated that unless the Commission makes participation
mandatory, the process of transferring mutual fund assets will continue to be done manually in some instances and
possibly will take months to complete. According to the commenter, this subjects the beneficial shareholders of
mutual fund shares to market fluctuation due to the inability to redeem or exchange their shares.

The second letter strongly recommends adopting the proposed rule change citing the changes pertaining to ACAT as
its primary concern.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 According to this commenter, the benefits of ACAT-Fund/Serv are twofold. The first advantage is the timely, high
quality customer service provided through ACAT. The second advantage is the cost savings arising from its efficiency
compared to the highly inefficient manual means used to effect the transfer of mutual fund accounts from one broker-dealer
to another.

This commenter cited the standardized settlement cycle and the decrease in the amount of work the fund ultimately
has to do as one of the most important aspects of ACAT-Fund/Serv transfers. A standardized settlement cycle safeguards
shareholder accounts from market fluctuation by limiting the duration of the ``fail to receive'' period during which
shares are unavailable for redemption or exchange.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 For reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the NYSE's amendments are consistent with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5).

Shortening the time period for transferring accounts from ten days to seven days is appropriate because of the enhanced
automation of the process by member organizations and clearing agencies. The shortened time period should be beneficial
to both customers and member organizations. In addition, reducing the time allowable for account transfers is consistent
with Commission Rule 15c6&hyph;1 mandating a three business day settlement cycle effective June 1, 1995.

The development by registered clearing agencies of automated systems to transfer mutual funds positions and residual
credit balances and their mandatory use should benefit both customers and member organizations by increasing efficiency,
reducing paperwork, and providing significant cost savings. Permitting partial account transfers to be accomplished
through automated account transfer systems should allow member organizations to provide more efficient and expeditious
transfers. The use of NYSE's more explicit reject codes should help reduce unnecessary back office operations functions
and should allow members to determine the exact reason for rejections of customer account transfers. The new reject
codes also will allow the NYSE to better monitor its members' rejections. The amendments requiring the resolution
or denial of claim letters within five business days should help provide a regulatory framework in an area where no
specific requirements currently exist and should expedite resolution of such claims.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants, registered open-end investment companies, have filed declarations pursuant to rule 24f&hyph;2
under the Act to register an indefinite amount of shares under the Securities Act of 1933.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An investment company that has filed a declaration under rule 24f&hyph;2 must file annual notices with the SEC and
pay share registration fees for shares sold in the previous fiscal year. If the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice is filed within
two months after the close of the investment company's fiscal year, the amount of the registration fee is based on net
sales (new sales minus redemptions) in the year in question. If the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice is not filed within two months,
the registration fee is based on gross sales (with no credit for redemptions). At the latest, the rule 24f&hyph;2 notice
along with the appropriate registration fee must be filed within six months after the end of an investment company's
fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants' fiscal years end on March 31. An officer of applicants mailed applicants' rule 24f&hyph;2 notices
for fiscal year 1993 on May 15, 1994, fifteen days before the two-month deadline. Because the Premium Account Fund
had net sales in 1993, the notices were accompanied by $5,288.99, the fee payable to register the shares sold by the
Premium Account Fund in excess of redemptions. The Money Fund had net redemptions in 1993 and, accordingly, no registration
fee was due. However, the filings were not received in the SEC's mail room until June 6, 1994, and were rejected as having
been filed too late to be eligible for a registration fee based on net sales. Thus, absent relief, applicants owe registration
fees based on gross sales. For fiscal year 1993, this would amount to an additional $1,496,343.19 for the Premium Account
Fund and $492,673.54 for the Money Fund.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and
to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, the SEC must find
that an investment company was not at fault to grant an exemption from the two month filing deadline of rule 24f&hyph;2.

2. Applicants believe that they acted in good faith in mailing their rule 24f&hyph;2 notice fifteen days before the
filing deadline. Applicants state that, except for ``an extraordinary delay in the mails,'' the filings should have
been received by the SEC well before the deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the section 6(c) standards. Thus, applicants request an exemption
under section 6(c) from rule 24f&hyph;2 to permit them to pay registration fees based on net sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Northeast Utilities (``Northeast''), 174 Brush Hill Ave., West Springfield Massachusetts 01089, a registered
holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Charter Oak Energy, Inc. (``Charter Oak'') and COE Development
Corporation (``COE Development'') (collectively, ``Applicants''), each located at 107 Selden Street, Berlin,
Connecticut, 06037&hyph;1616, have filed a further post-effective amendment under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10,
12(b), and 33 of the Act and rules 45 and 53 thereunder to their application-declaration filed under sections 6(a),
7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 13(b) of the Act and rules 45, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated January 24, 1994 (HCAR. 25977) (``January 1994 Order'') Charter Oak and COE Development were authorized
to engage in preliminary development activities and make investments in and finance the acquisition of exempt wholesale
generators (``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs'') in the amount of $100 million through December
30, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The January 1994 Order also authorized the Applicants to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of subsidiary
companies for preliminary development activities.

The Applicants stated in post-effective amendment number 5 to their application-declaration that they would not
acquire an interest in an intermediate holding company of Northeast that holds, or would acquire, an interest in a
FUCO without prior Commission approval, unless and until the Commission adopts rules that provide that intermediate
companies themselves may be considered FUCOs under the Act. The January 1994 Order authorized post-effective amendment
number 5.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicants now propose to finance the acquisition, and hold the securities, of: (i) foreign utility companies
(``FUCOs''), as defined in Section 33 of the Act, subject to certain limitations; and (ii) companies (``Intermediate
Companies'') engaged directly or indirectly and exclusively in the business of owning and holding the securities
of one or more FUCOs and/or exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32 of the Act, subject to
certain limitations. Investments in and financings of FUCOs and Intermediate Companies will be subject to the $100
million limit authorized in the January 1994 Order. The financings and investments in FUCOs and Intermediate Companies
may take the same form and will be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as set forth in the January 1994 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Applicants propose to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of FUCOs and Intermediate Companies
in connection with development activities, including construction and permanent financing. Until such time as
there is no possibility of a claim against Northeast or Charter Oak, the full contingent amount of any such guarantees
and assumptions of liability would be included in the $100 million limit authorized in the January 1994 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicants state that they have found that the ability to respond quickly to investment opportunities in FUCOs
and finance the acquisition, and hold the securities, of Intermediate Companies to make such investments is necessary
in order to compete effectively in this market in accordance with the principles set forth in the Energy Policy Act
of 1992. The Applicants also state that the use of Intermediate Companies is often necessitated by business concerns
such as foreign ownership requirements in countries where FUCOs are located or to facilitate investments via a consortium
of companies where each member of the consortium has a consolidated subsidiary involved in the final FUCO structure
for tax and accounting purposes and to ease subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among members of the ownership
group.

EUA Cogenex Corporation (70&hyph;8441)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EUA Cogenex Corporation (``Cogenex''), Boot Mills South, 100 Foot of John Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01852,
a non-utility subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''), a registered holding company, has filed an
application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 86, 87, 90 and
91 thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cogenex proposes to form and finance a new non-utility subsidiary, EUA Cogenex_Canada (``Cogen Canada''). Cogen
Canada would consult and provide energy management and demand-side management services to institutional customers
in Canada. Specifically, Cogenex seeks Commission authorization through December 31, 1996 for (a) the organization
of Cogen Canada under the laws of Canada and (b) the acquisition by Cogenex of all 100 shares of common stock to be issued
by Cogen Canada for $1.00 each. Additionally, Cogenex seeks Commission authorization through December 31, 1995
to provide equity and debt funding for Cogen Canada and for Cogen Canada to borrow from third parties in amounts not
to aggregate more than $20 million outstanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, Cogenex seeks Commission authorization through December 31, 1997 to sell certain equipment and services to
Cogen Canada and for EUA Service Corporation (``EUASC'') to provide certain management, financial and other services
to Cogen Canada. Cogenex would charge Cogen Canada for such goods and services on a fair market value basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated December 19, 1986 (HCAR No. 24273) (``1986 Order''), the Commission authorized EUA to acquire the predecessor
corporation of Cogenex, in order to provide certain energy management services in New England and, to a limited extent,
outside New England. By order dated September 17, 1992 (HCAR No. 25636) (``1992 Order''), the Commission authorized
Cogenex to provide additional energy management and demand-side management (``DSM'') services and to develop cogeneration
projects. The 1992 Order also expanded the area in which such services could be provided without limitation to New
York (together with New England, ``Base Region''). By order dated June 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25839) (``1993 Order''),
the Commission authorized Cogenex to borrow up to $50 million from EUA in short-term debt through December 31, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1986 and 1992 Orders authorized Cogenex to provide energy management and DSM services without limitation to customers
within the Base Region. These orders also authorized Cogenex to provide such services to customers outside the Base
Region provided that the revenues for such services to those customers not exceed the revenues for such services inside
the Base Region (``Fifty Percent Requirement''). The 1986 and the 1992 Orders imposed no restriction on revenues
from consulting services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cogen Canada and Cogenex would provide energy management and DSM services outside the Base Region, subject to the
Fifty Percent Requirement. The application-declaration proposes, however, that revenues from such services in
the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick be included in the revenues of the Base Region and purposes of assessing
compliance with the Fifty Percent Requirement. Cogenex also proposes that there be no restriction on revenues of
Cogenex and Cogen Canada from consulting services and that Cogenex be permitted to market its consulting services
worldwide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cogenex seeks authorization through December 31, 1995 to provide EUA with debt and equity financing (``Cogenex Investments'').
Such funds would take the form of additional acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances
and/or short-term loans. All short-term loans and advances by Cogenex to Cogen Canada would be made on the basis of
the terms available to Cogenex on short-term loans from EUA under the 1993 Order. Specifically, these arrangements
provide for borrowings at the prime rate or money market rates, together with a commitment fee of 1/4 of 1%. Each such
loan or advance would mature in one year or less.

Cogenex also seeks authorization through December 31, 1997 for Cogen Canada to borrow on a short-term basis from third
parties, which debt may be guaranteed by Cogenex. The interest rate on such debt denominated in dollars would not exceed
the commercial base rate at the First National Bank of Boston at the time a loan is made. The interest rate on such debt
denominated in Canadian dollars would not exceed the Canadian prime rate as published in the

Investments, would not aggregate more than U.S. $20 million outstanding at any one time.

Cogenex proposes that Cogen Canada enter into an agreement with EUA Service Corporation (``EUASC''), pursuant to
which EUASC would render certain management, financial, accounting and other services to Cogen Canada. Cogenex
further requests authority through December 31, 1997 to provide equipment and services to Cogen Canada, as and when
needed, on a fair market value basis, but at no less than cost. Cogenex also proposes licensing the use of certain know-how,
technologies, models and systems to Cogen Canada appropriate for conservation and load management services.

Consolidated proposes to create and acquire through its subsidiary, CNG Energy, a newly formed corporation, CNG
Market Center Services, Inc. (``CNGMC''). CNGMC was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24,
1994, with an authorized equity capitalization of $2 million consisting of 200 shares of common stock, $10,000 par
value each. CNGMC proposes to issue up to 200 shares of its common stock to CNG Energy, at a price of $10,000 per share,
to become a special purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary of CNG Energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNGMC will own a 50% general partnership interest in a Delaware partnership (``Partnership'') to be set up to develop
and operate a new natural gas market center to be called the ``CNG/Sabine Center.'' The other 50% general partnership
interest in the Partnership will be owned by Sabine Hub Services Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texaco, Inc.
CNGMC proposes to make capital contributions to the Partnership in the aggregate amount not to exceed $2 million.

The CNG/Sabine Center will introduce the ``super-hub'' concept by offering services at points along the 7,400 mile
pipeline system of CNGT, a wholly-owned pipeline subsidiary of Consolidated. The Application states that the use
of the CNGT pipeline system would be under the open-access provisions of Order 636 of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission as now applicable to CNGT. Initial services to be provided by the Partnership will consist of an intra-hub
transfer service, a market activity reporting service, and a transportation, parking and short-term storage agency
service. In addition, other gas market center services may also be offered at the CNG/Sabine Center to meet the evolving
needs of the natural gas industry. The Application states that the proposed activities of the Partnership satisfy
the requirements of either Section 2 (a) or (b) of the Gas Related Activities of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG Energy proposes to raise funds to invest in CNGMC, and CNGMC in turn proposes to raise funds to invest in the Partnership,
by (i) selling shares of its respective common stock ($1,000 par value each in the case of CNG Energy and $10,000 par
value each in the case of CNGMC) to the issuer's immediate parent; (ii) open account advances from the borrower's immediate
parent, or the CNG System Money Pool (``Money Pool'');
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and/or (iii) long-term loans from the borrower's immediate parent, in any combination thereof, provided that the
amounts and terms of CNG Energy to CNGMC financing (or Money Pool in the case of open account advances) shall be the mirror
image of the same respective type of Consolidated to CNG Energy financings. CNGMC proposes to become a full participant
to the Money Pool.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The open account advances and long-term loans will have the same effective terms and interest rates as related borrowings
of Consolidated in the forms listed below: (1) Open account advances may be made to the borrower to provide working
capital. Open account advances may be made, repaid and remade on a revolving basis, and all such open account advances
will be repaid on or before a date not more than one year from the date of the first advance to such borrower with interest
at the same effective rate of interest as Consolidated's weighted average effective rate of commercial paper and/or
revolving credit borrowings. If no such borrowings are outstanding, then the interest rate shall be predicated on
the Federal Funds' effective rate of interest as quoted daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Such advances
may be made through the Money Pool. (2) Consolidated or CNG Energy may make long-term loans to its respective immediate
subsidiary, CNG Energy Or CNGMC, for the financing of its activities described herein. Loans shall be evidenced by
long-term non-negotiable notes of the borrower (documented by book entry only) maturing over a period of time (not
in excess of 30 years), with the interest rate predicated on and equal to Consolidated's cost of funds for comparable
borrowings. In the event Consolidated has not had recent comparable borrowings, the rates will be tied to the Salomon
Brothers Inc. indicative rate for comparable debt issuances published in Salomon Brothers Inc. Bond Market Roundup
or similar publication on the date nearest to the time of takedown. All loans may be prepaid at any time without premium
or penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Application states that Consolidated will obtain the funds required for CNG Energy through internal cash generation,
issuance of long-term debt securities, borrowings under credit agreements or through other authorizations approved
by the Commission subsequent to the effective date of this Application.

Shipping Coordinating Committee, International Maritime Organization (IMO) Legal Committee; Notice of Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Shipping Coordinating Committee (SHC) will conduct an open meeting at 10:00 a.m., on Thursday, September
22, 1994, in Room 6103 of U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. The purpose of
this meeting is to prepare for the 71st Session of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Legal Committee
to be held October 10&hyph;14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the attendance of those participants who may be interested in only certain aspects of the public meeting,
the first subject addressed will be the draft International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage
in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS Convention). The second major subject,
which will be considered at approximately 11:30 a.m., will be possible revisions to the 1976 Convention on Limitation
of Liability for Maritime Claims ('76 LLMC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current draft of the HNS Convention imposes strict liability upon the shipowner with an additional international
fund (second-tier fund) modeled after the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. The draft HNS Convention
provides compensation for environmental damage as well as personal injury and property damage from a broad range
of substances. At the 70th Session, the Legal Committee finalized decisions on several issues regarding the draft
HNS Convention and agreed in principle on several others. However, other important questions remain to be resolved,
such as: (1) Whether receivers or importers should pay into the second-tier instead of shippers and exporters; (2)
whether transshipment receivers will be required to pay into the second-tier; and (3) whether domestic voyages of
seagoing vessels will be covered by the draft HNS Convention and similarly be required to contribute to the second-tier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Legal Committee resumed deliberations on the '76 LLMC at the 70th Session. Several decisions were made, and discussion
centered on a draft protocol which provides for raising the limits of liability and a streamlined tacit amendment
procedure. Work will continue at the 71st session in October. The '76 LLMC has been in force since December 1, 1986,
and has been ratified by 22 nations. Although the United States has not ratified the '76 LLMC, interests within the
United States_such as owners of foreign flag vessels and passengers on foreign flag vessels_may be affected by changes
to the Convention. The views of the public are requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the public are invited to attend the SHC meeting, up to the seating capacity of the room. For further information
or to submit views concerning the subjects of discussion, contact either Captain David J. Kantor or Lieutenant Commander
Steven D. Poulin, U.S. Coast Guard (G&hyph;LMI), 2100 Second Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20593, telephone (202)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ISTEA) provides various tools for more efficient management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhancement of our Nation's public transit infrastructure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the President's guidance on infrastructure investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urges all levels of government to foster economic growth by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting integrated investment in infrastructure; Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments,'' signed by the President on January 26, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directs each executive department ``to ensure efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management of infrastructure *&blank;*&blank;* '' and ``to encourage private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector investment, which is a key objective of our efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote innovative financing.'' By encouraging private sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment in transit infrastructure, FTA hopes to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market-oriented and results-driven project analysis and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management techniques to bear on meeting the nation's current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and projected transit infrastructure needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our challenge therefore is to facilitate a program of public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private transit infrastructure investment that both preserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing base of transit assets and ensures that investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for transit system expansion can be made as needed. Such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program of infrastructure preservation and enhancement must take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum advantage of existing capital markets and techniques for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leveraging the effectiveness of infrastructure investment by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of government. It must increase private capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation while maintaining or expanding public sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment. Department of Transportation Secretary Federico 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pe&ntilde;a, responding to this challenge, requested that FTA explore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovative ways to finance the transportation needs of our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nation, taking into account a continuing Federal commitment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit support as well as a growing private sector interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA has identified specific provisions that were added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal transit laws by ISTEA that make it easier for States and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
localities to plan and execute integrated public transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment programs, but more is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Issues and Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparation for the FY 1996 budget process, FTA is asking for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) identification of joint public and private ventures in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public transportation that demonstrate the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private capital investment in transit, (2) identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects to remove or modify rules and policies that inhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective transit infrastructure management, and (3) specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local transit project proposals that would test or implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovative financing techniques. We believe the most effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way to do this is to rely upon those who have led their industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in developing such techniques and projects for applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples. FTA will use the innovations proposed to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions for the next surface transportation authorization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarize and disseminate the results of projects for peer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and, to the extent possible, provide technical assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in project advancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Innovative Concepts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The types of projects that FTA seeks should use innovative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing concepts that enhance the effectiveness of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit investment by either generating increased investment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by reducing overall project costs. The following techniques and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISTEA provisions are illustrative of the types of innovation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we are seeking: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Structured leasing of fixed transit facilities, through the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Certificates of Participation (COP's), Grant Anticipation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notes, or other mechanisms that generate cost reductions or net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present value benefits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;New combinations of funding in support of transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrastructure, such as in-kind local contributions, sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development rights, realizing or enhancing land-use impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits, or private funding of transit facilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Using 49 U.S.C. 5312(a), added by ISTEA to transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing, federally supported assets to more effective use; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Initiating innovative procurements such as multi-year rolling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock procurements, forming consortia to facilitate efficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of scale in rolling stock procurements, or using design-build 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Turnkey) as a method of infrastructure project delivery; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Using various securities to attract private capital investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to transit, refinance existing debt, or otherwise ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term, stable sources of funding for infrastructure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establishing or using existing authority to provide direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans for transit and other infrastructure projects, possibly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a revolving loan fund mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preceding are examples only. We welcome all ideas and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects that have the potential to leverage existing or planned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrastructure investment, or that will help to reduce public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation costs over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA will make full use of its regulatory and statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in fostering innovative financing proposals for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit. However, the projects proposed under this initiative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must comply with all other statutory and regulatory requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as the National Environmental Policy Act, Civil Rights, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Clean Air Act.

Project Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals for candidate projects should describe: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The project specifics_i.e., what is being bought, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed, financed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Project funding_federal aid, by type, as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding sources. This should include funding realized through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capturing external economic benefits resulting from project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing, as appropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction Financing_What mechanisms are being used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finance the construction portion of the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Intermodal Impacts/Benefits_The degree to which the transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment benefits other modes (airports, intercity rail, etc.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is enhanced by other modes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The status of major Federal and State clearances; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The financing innovation, and how its use in this context could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit and apply to other projects in the region or the Nation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The incentive required_i.e., fast-tracking, re-programming, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional funding, administrative or regulatory flexibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief, etc.; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How the proposed innovation will leverage Federal, State, local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and private investment for public transit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A timeline for advancing the project, including milestones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals must be for projects eligible under the FT Act. New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and reconstruction projects are appropriate, as are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rolling stock projects. Those proposals which meet major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal clearance requirements will receive preference in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review process. Upon acceptance of a grantee's proposal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project will be advanced in an expedited manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited capital funds are available. Therefore, projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed will be judged on the basis of broad applicability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the innovation, current project status (in planning, final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering, environmental clearance, commencement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction), the likelihood of near-term (1&hyph;2 years) project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion, and level of Federal funding required. We do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expect to fund all projects received. Projects and initiatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring administrative or regulatory flexibility will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited as to number, but will be judged on the basis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovation, their potential for application to other transit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems or other modes, and the likelihood of near-term results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the administrative or regulatory change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT&amp;PF), will
prepare an EIS on a proposal to upgrade and extend Dowling Road, an east-west arterial, from the Raspberry interchange
at Minnesota Drive eastward to Lake Otis Parkway. The proposed project would be approximately three miles long.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed improvements would include: a four to six lane roadway for the entire length of the project; a crossing
of the Alaska Railroad tracks; replacement of a bridge crossing Campbell Creek; modification or replacement of an
interchange bridge at the New Seward Highway; facilities for pedestrians, bicyclists, the disabled, and transit
users; signalization and illumination; and a drainage system. The proposed project would be constructed in stages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is necessary to meet the community's current and future transportation needs. Dowling Road,
between the Old Seward Highway and Lake Otis Parkway, is currently over capacity, especially during peak hours. Traffic
congestion significantly delays drivers and contributes to deterioration of Anchorage's air quality. Pedestrians
are poorly accommodated due to the lack of roadway shoulders and pedestrian facilities. The road improvement would
alleviate traffic congestion on other east-west arterials such as Tudor Road, International Airport Road, and Dimond
Boulevard. The proposed action is an integral part of the Anchorage Metropolitan Area Transportation Study Long
Range Transportation Plan and the Municipality of Anchorage Official Streets and Highway Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives which would be considered include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No action;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upgrading and extending Dowling Road to connect to the Raspberry interchange at Minnesota Drive via a Rovenna
Street alignment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Upgrading and extending Dowling Road to connect to the Raspberry interchange at Minnesota Drive via a `C' Street/Raspberry
Road alignment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Traffic system management strategies that include alternatives such as improved signal timing, upgrading mass
transit, and travel demand reduction strategies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA and ADOT&amp;PF have contracted with a private consultant to prepare the EIS, develop various design alternatives,
and conduct the preliminary engineering studies. The consultant will be responsible for all scoping activities
including the notification of appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and citizens
who might be potentially interested in this proposal. A series of meetings and other activities to discuss the project
and solicit input from agencies and the public will be conducted in the fall of 1994 and continue into 1995. FHWA and
ADOT&amp;PF will make requests for formal cooperating agency status prior to other scoping activities. In addition,
public hearings will be held after completion of the draft EIS. Public notice will be given of the time and places of
the hearings at a later date. The Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public
hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that a full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has the responsibility to devise strategies to reduce the number of motor vehicle collisions and to save lives
and reduce injuries and property damage through the prevention and reduction in severity of motor vehicle collisions.
NHTSA's Office of Crash Avoidance Research conducts and manages research intended to: analyze driver-vehicle interaction,
identify specific vehicle designs, components, or parameters associated with driver performance errors and resulting
collisions, and develop and evaluate vehicle-based collision avoidance countermeasure concepts and devices.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1.6 million truck tractors and 3.6 million trailers in use in the motor carrier industry today.
IVHS technology offers a significant potential to improve the productivity of the industry and help reduce the approximately
200,000 crashes in which these vehicles are involved each year. To date, the application of these technologies to
commercial vehicles has been limited to single unit trucks and truck tractors because of constraints inherent in
the present combination-unit truck trailer electrical powering and signalling communication system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditionally, the U.S. trucking industry equipment needs have been supplied by the truck/tractor manufacturer
(supplying the towing unit) and the trailer manufacturer (supplying the cargo space to move goods). The two units
are married at the fifth wheel of the power unit and the king-pin of the trailer. Communication and powering between
the tractor and trailer consists of little more than supplying power and control from the tractor to the running lights
of the trailer through the standard seven pin electrical connector (seven circuits). One of the primary reasons for
lack of technology change in the standard seven circuit connection between the tractor and trailer is that any change
may result in lack of compatibility between tractors and trailers operating in the U.S. However, the defense, aerospace,
and computer industries have begun to focus on commercial vehicle applications as a potential new market for their
innovative ideas and advanced technologies to improve safety, efficiency and productivity. In order for these advances
to happen, they must comply with the needs and objectives of the users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle/unit locators, vehicle/driver trip loggers, on-board weight measurement and recording systems, vehicle
maintenance status monitor/recorder/transmitters, administrative credentials transponders, etc., are envisioned,
and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors, resulting in significant operational efficiency
benefits. Likewise, sideward-looking, reward-looking, and forward-looking collision avoidance systems, driver
performance monitors, antilock and electronic braking systems, brake maintenance status monitors, etc., are envisioned,
and in some cases, beginning to be installed on trucks and tractors to enhance their operational safety performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the application of these developing technologies to commercial vehicles has been limited predominately
to the power unit. There is clearly a need to overcome the inherent constraints presently found in the communicating
and powering system between tractors and trailers. These constraints are exacerbated in the case of multi-unit combination
tractor/trailers, the vehicle type which will likely have an increased future role in improving the productivity
of the motor carrier industry. The ability to install advanced technology IVHS productivity and safety enhancing
equipment on this type of vehicle may be a key element in making their expanded future use practical and acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of possibilities have been suggested to address this issue, including but not limited to: radio/telemetry
communication linkages among units in the combination, communications signal multiplexing, voltage enhancements,
wiring system upgrades, additional electrical circuits and/or wiring connector systems, etc. The successful introduction
of any or all of these approaches will hinge on whether they can be integrated, and be compatible with existing equipment
in the current commercial motor carrier fleet. A comparative evaluation of these approaches, and fleet demonstrations
of the most promising among these, will help foster the implementation of IVHS technology in this application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assess the functional capabilities and limitations, as well as the reliability and practicality, of alternative
means of providing power to and sending/receiving communication signals to/from multiple numbers and different
types of advanced technology safety and productivity enhancing systems on multi-unit combination heavy commercial
tractor/trailers. Assessments will be made with a view to fostering the ability of system suppliers and truck users
to commercially deploy these type systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Research Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that a teaming approach may be necessary to conduct this research. One or more cooperative agreements
are envisioned in which a consortium of organizations with experience in truck/tractor manufacturing, trailer
manufacturing, electronic system and component development, wiring and connectors, vehicle test and evaluation,
and motor carrier operation (in the case of an in-service demonstration project) appear ideally suited to pursue
this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the potential for cost sharing, the performing organization may retain the rights to any proprietary product
or technology developed under the agreement, subject to a government use license. The organization would be free
to pursue commercial development and marketing for the products. NHTSA will require deliverables, however, which
could include reports suitable for publishing in the public domain to document such items as the research methods
and system evaluation results. Certain proprietary information, such as algorithms, need not be released in the
public domain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that one or more cooperative agreements may be awarded under this program. Projects will be funded
incrementally, with up to a three-year support period. The maximum funding level that is anticipated for the total
project is $575,000, excluding cost sharing provided by the performing organization(s). The maximum incremental
funding available in any one year is anticipated to be $300,000.

1994 IRS Small Business Customer Satisfaction Survey

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this survey is to collect information from small businesses (owners, partners, and corporate officers)
in order to determine their opinions about the quality of service provided by the IRS; understand the relative importance
they place on the various aspects of quality service, and establish a baseline by which to measure changes in their
satisfaction with IRS performance. This study is necessary to satisfy the requirements of Executive Order 12862,
which requires federal agencies to survey their customers about their satisfaction with existing services and to
identify services that these customers desire. It will provide crucial information needed by IRS to develop and implement
effective customer satisfaction measures that meet the Agency's mandate to improve quality service.
