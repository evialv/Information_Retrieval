SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document reinstates the cooperative pool reserve processing plant delivery requirement of 35 percent under
the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania Federal milk order (Order 36), as of January 1, 1996. A reduction from 35 to
25 percent was intended to be temporary for the period July 1, 1993, through August 31, 1994. The current issue of the
Code of Federal Regulations shows the percentage requirement to be 25 percent. The percentage of a cooperative association's
member milk that must be delivered to pool distributing plants to qualify the cooperative's reserve processing plant
for pooling continues to be 25 percent until December 31, 1995, rather than 35 percent. This action is necessary to
prevent uneconomic movements of milk for the purpose of pooling much of the market's supply.

Revision of Rule: Issued July 22, 1993; published July 30, 1993 (58 FR 40724). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Proposed Temporary Revision: Issued June 27, 1994; published July 1, 1994 (59 FR 33922). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will continue to
have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revision is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the provisions
of &sect;1036.7(f) of the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 33922) concerning a proposed relaxation of the cooperative association reserve processing plant shipping
requirement. The revision was proposed to be effective for the months of September 1994 through December 1995. The
public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the proposed notice by submitting written data, views and arguments
by August 1, 1994. Three comments supporting the proposed revision were received. No opposing comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule continues to ease the pooling requirements for cooperative reserve processing plants by 10 percentage
points, to 25 percent, for the period September 1, 1994, through December 31, 1995. Under the revision the total minimum
quantity of a cooperative association's milk supply that is required to be delivered to distributing plants in order
for the cooperative's reserve supply plant to maintain pool status is reduced from 35 percent to 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for a cooperative association plant that does not qualify as a pool distributing or pool supply plant to be
a pool plant, the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order requires that the cooperative must deliver to pool distributing
plants a minimum of 35 percent of the total quantity of milk marketed by the cooperative, either during the month or
during the 12-month period ending with the immediately preceding month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase
or decrease the required shipping percentages for cooperative reserve supply plants by up to 10 percentage points
if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revision was requested originally for the period July 1993 through August 1994 by Milk Marketing, Inc. (MMI),
a cooperative association that represents many of the market's producers. As printed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the revision became effective July 1, 1993, with no termination date. The 1994 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
reflects the revised shipping standards, and without further amendatory action, the 1995 CFR will also reflect the
reduced 25-percent shipping standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMI requested continued revision of the cooperative association shipping requirements for the period September
1, 1994, through December 31, 1995, and a proposed revision was issued. Comments supporting the revision were received
from MMI and two other cooperative associations with members whose milk is pooled under Order 36. MMI, Eastern Milk
Producers Cooperative Association, Inc. (Eastern), and Dairylea Cooperative, Inc. (Dairylea), stated that the
revision is needed to prevent unnecessary and uneconomic movements of milk because of the current severe milk supply-demand
imbalance in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMI's comments included a description of milk marketing conditions for June 1994 that show milk production for the
market increased over 4 percent from the same month of the previous year, representing 12 million additional pounds
of milk in the Order 36 pool. For the same month, Class I sales decreased by nearly 2.5 percent from June 1993, representing
a reduction of approximately 3.4 million pounds of Class I sales. As a result of the market's increasing production
and declining Class I use, nearly 15.5 million pounds of milk had to be used in manufactured products than in the same
month the previous year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments filed by Eastern stated that the trends observable for June are expected to continue for the foreseeable
future, creating additional pooling difficulties for cooperative handlers pooling milk under Order 36. Dairylea
stated that continuation of the revision would prevent unnecessary, uneconomic movements of milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to comments filed, milk supplies historically pooled under the order currently are continuing to lose
their markets and having to find new outlets for their production. Apparently, Order 36 and nearby pool distributing
and pool supply plants are releasing some of their milk suppliers to find their own markets for milk. Such institutional
changes in the sources of supply for various plants may result in market instability and disorder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milk production in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania marketing area appears to be increasing while Class I use
is declining. As a result, greater volumes of milk must be diverted to manufacturing uses than in prior years. The last
full year before the 1990 proceeding that resulted in the amendments that took effect October 1, 1993, was 1989. During
the short production months (September through November) of 1989, the percentage of Order 36 producer milk needed
for Class I use was over 60 percent, with less than 30 percent of the market's milk used in Class III. For the same period
of 1992, the percentage of producer milk used in Class I was just 55 percent, with the Class III percentage increasing
to nearly 36 percent. The trend continued during the same months of 1993, with less than 55 percent of the producer milk
pooled during September, October and November used in Class I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increased production and decline in Class I sales, coupled with the market's changing handler-producer relationships,
necessitates a continuation in the reduction of the percentage of milk that must be delivered by a cooperative association
to pool distributing plants in order to assure the pool status of the cooperative's member milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision effective July 1, 1993, should continue in effect for a period long enough to allow the institutional
shifts currently in process to work themselves out, and for the cooperative associations to assure themselves of
an adequate fluid market for their producer milk. Therefore, the revision should remain in place through December
1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth, and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that the diversion limitation percentage set forth in &sect;1036.7(d) should be
maintained at the present 25-percent level through December 31, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule allows Small Business Investment Companies licensed under sections 301 (c) and (d) of the Small Business
Investment Act of 1958 (Licensees) having no immediate need for SBA financial assistance (Leverage) to reserve the
future availability of such financial assistance by obtaining SBA's conditional commitment to guarantee Debentures
or Participating Securities (collectively ``pooled securities''), or to purchase Preferred Securities, that
will be offered in the future as the Licensee draws against SBA's commitment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 8, 1994, SBA published a proposed rule which contemplated allowing Licensees to apply for a conditional
commitment from SBA to reserve Leverage for their future use. See 59 FR 40315. The amount of Leverage that could be reserved
by any Licensee was proposed to be not less than $1,000,000, and not more than 50 percent of the Licensee's Regulatory
Capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The public was afforded a 30-day period in which to submit comments on the proposed rule. SBA received six comment letters
during that time, all of which strongly supported the underlying concept of an Agency commitment of future financial
assistance to Licensees but which also made several suggestions for improving the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One recurring suggestion was that SBA eliminate the restriction on the amount that could be reserved on behalf of any
one Licensee. As stated above, the proposed rule would have established a commitment ceiling equal to 50% of a Licensee's
Regulatory Capital. Although SBA's rationale for the ceiling was not discussed in the proposed rule, most of the commenters
understood that the ceiling was proposed in an attempt to fairly distribute scarce resources and to prevent the hoarding
of committed funds by any one Licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA did realize, as the comment letters pointed out, that even if there were no ceiling in the regulations, the Agency
would still have the authority to allocate commitment authority among interested Licensees. Nevertheless, SBA
believed that given: (i) A probable timetable for the funding of an average Licensee's investors' commitments of
25% a year for 4 years (thereby converting the Licensee's Regulatory Capital into Leverageable Capital) and (ii)
an ideal Leverage ratio during those 4 years of 2:1, the average Licensee's need for committed Leverage funds would
be adequately met by an annual limit of 50% of Regulatory Capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA has reconsidered its position and has concluded that the regulation should be broad enough to accommodate, without
resort to an Agency waiver, those Licensees with investor-funding schedules that are more compressed than the average.
SBA still believes that some ceiling is desirable administratively, but a ceiling set at 50% of Regulatory Capital
may be too low, particularly in years when demand for reserved funds does not exceed the supply. Accordingly, in this
final rule, SBA has increased the ceiling to 100% of Regulatory Capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second suggestion submitted during the comment period addressed the documentation proposed to be required pre-
and post-funding of draws under SBA's commitment. Under the proposed rule, every Licensee with an outstanding commitment
from SBA would be required to submit a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) within 30 days of the close of
each of its fiscal quarters. A Licensee submitting a draw request within that 30-day period would be required to submit
the Short Form Financial Statement, or a statement of no adverse change since its most recent Short Form 468, with the
draw request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few of the comment letters objected to quarterly financial reporting as burdensome and unnecessary. SBA disagrees.
The preparation of a quarterly short form financial statement becomes a simple matter if performed on a personal computer,
using readily-available bookkeeping software together with reporting software provided by SBA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the commitment funding process as proposed by SBA was not intended to put SBA at a disadvantage relative
to where it would have been if it were considering a request for Leverage under the traditional funding mechanism.
Since Leverage requests outside of the commitment process must be accompanied by a Short Form 468 for the most recent
fiscal quarter, and since the draw down of funds under the SBA commitment is the issuance of Leverage, SBA should receive
a Short Form 468 for the most recent quarter in order to evaluate a draw request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the commitment funding process, decisions on requests for draws will have to be made quickly by SBA staff, more
quickly than decisions on requests for Leverage under the traditional funding process. SBA staff will need to monitor
more closely the financial status of a Licensee with an outstanding SBA commitment in order to be able to respond in
a timely fashion to the Licensee's draw requests. The filing of quarterly financial statements on Short Form 468 by
all Licensees with outstanding SBA commitments will allow SBA to perform that function as promised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, in the event the draw request is made within 30 days of the end of the Licensee's fiscal quarter,
SBA had proposed to accept a statement of no adverse change in lieu of the Short Form 468. Most of the comment letters
argued in favor of adopting the more familiar standard of ``no material adverse change''. SBA agrees that adverse
changes which are immaterial to the Licensee's financial status should not be a barrier to consideration for a draw
of Leverage. Accordingly, &sect;107.215(f)(3)(i)(A) has been finalized with the suggested change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the comment letters also contained an objection to the requirement for specific deal information both pre-
and post-draw. SBA reaffirms its position that while a Licensee need not have specific transactions under consideration
in order to obtain SBA's commitment, draws under that commitment must be intended for use in a particular transaction
with a particular small concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ease the paperwork burden on Licensees, however, the statement evidencing the Licensee's need for the funds no
longer requires that the Licensee provide the small concern's Standard Industrial Classification code number or
a summary of the proposed financing. See proposed &sect;107.215(f)(2)(i)(B), finalized as &sect;107.215(f)(3)(i)(B).
Instead, the statement must include only the name and address of the small concern, the amount of the proposed financing,
and the scheduled closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA is also extending by 30 days the due date for the written explanation of the failure to close a transaction. In summary,
if the intended transaction closes, the Licensee must submit a Form 1031 (``Portfolio Financing Report'') within
30 days of the actual closing date. If the transaction fails to close, however, a written explanation must be filed
with SBA within 60 days (instead of 30 days, as proposed) after the scheduled closing date. Penalties for the failure
to file the Form 1031 or the written explanation remain unchanged from the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final documentation matter addressed in some of the comment letters concerns the requirement that a Licensee
submit a certified statement with each draw request representing that it is in compliance with applicable regulations.
The suggestion was made that SBA be permitted to accept draw requests in the event violations are disputed or are not
material in nature. SBA has considered the suggestion and believes a clarification of the subject matter is in order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA did not intend to apply a different standard to draw requests than it currently applies to Leverage requests. A
Licensee with an unresolved regulatory violation that would not be cause for automatic disqualification for Leverage
under the traditional funding process should not, for the same violation, be disqualified automatically from drawing
down Leverage under the commitment funding process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In practice, there are two separate circumstances under the traditional funding process where SBA would consider
favorably the Leverage request of a Licensee with an outstanding violation: (1) If the Licensee's violation is of
a non-substantive provision of the Act or regulations and the Licensee has not repeatedly violated non-substantive
provisions; or (2) if the Licensee has agreed with SBA on a course of action for the resolution of its violation, and
if the terms of the agreement do not preclude the Licensee from obtaining Leverage prior to the resolution of the violation.
In each case, the determination as to whether a violation exists is made by SBA, as is the decision to provide Leverage
notwithstanding the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA has revised the proposed rule to allow for favorable consideration of a draw request under those two circumstances.
See new paragraph 107.215(f)(2) ``Conditions to draws.'' Proposed &sect;107.215(f)(2) has been renumbered as
&sect;107.215(f)(3), and now permits a Licensee to submit a certification that, to the best of its knowledge and belief,
it is in compliance with applicable regulations (i.e., it has no unresolved regulatory violations) or an explanation
as to the specific nature of any outstanding violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One additional change has been made to the proposed rule. The amount of the commitment fee was not set forth in the proposal.
This final rule fixes -he commitment fee at 3% of the face amount of the pooled securities and 1% of the issue price of
the Preferred Securities reserved under the commitment. As explained below, when pooled securities are issued by
a Licensee as a draw against SBA's commitment, the 2% guaranty fee ordinarily due pursuant to &sect;107.210(d)(1)
will be offset against the 3% commitment fee already paid. No additional payment will be necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of some minor changes in wording, the proposed rule is otherwise adopted without change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective immediately, any Licensee may submit an application for SBA's conditional commitment to reserve Leverage.
The Application must be accompanied by the same financial information and other documentation as is required of Licensees
applying for Leverage, except that no securities forms should accompany an application for SBA's commitment. For
a Licensee wishing to participate in the next scheduled pooling of Leverage securities, and also wishing to obtain
SBA's conditional commitment for future Leverage, separate applications should be filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination to grant a Licensee's request for a commitment will be made only after SBA reviews the applicant's
financial and regulatory status as well as its representation as to projected needs. The actual amount of a commitment
which SBA will approve for a particular Licensee will depend in part on factors other than the applicant Licensee's
own financial and regulatory situation, including such matters as the anticipated need for Leverage by all other
Licensees making Leverage requests and the amount of program authority appropriated by Congress for the fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commitment, when granted, will represent a conditional agreement on SBA's part to permit a Licensee to make draws
against an agreed upon reserved amount of Leverage over a fixed period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition to a commitment's taking effect, the Licensee must pay a non-refundable commitment fee in the amount
discussed above. Payment must be received within thirty days following SBA's issuance of the commitment, or prior
to any draw against the commitment if requested within such thirty day period. When a Licensee issuing pooled securities
draws against SBA's commitment, the amount of the user fee associated with the guarantee of the Licensee's security
or securities will be debited against an account holding the commitment fees and credited against an account holding
guaranty fees. Failure to make timely and full payment of the commitment fee will preclude any draws against the commitment,
and will cause SBA's commitment to lapse automatically at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the thirtieth calendar day following
SBA's issuance of the commitment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, as mentioned above, SBA's commitment will also lapse at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 60th calendar day
preceding the close of the next full Federal fiscal year following issuance of such commitment. Under present law,
the Federal fiscal year ends on September 30. Therefore, depending upon when within a given Federal fiscal year a commitment
was extended, the term of the commitment may be as short as ten months or as long as twenty-two months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for a draw may be submitted at any time during the term of the commitment. It is contemplated that requests
for a draw of pooled securities will, eventually, be funded as frequently as twice a month. Requests for a draw of preferred
securities may be funded at any time. The minimum amount of any draw of pooled securities will be $1,000,000, with integral
multiples of $100,000 permitted thereafter. Requests for draws of preferred securities may be in any amount.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was explained in the proposed rule, SBA's present general practice, which is not proposed to be changed (and which
SBA is extending to Participating Securities) is to extend invitations to Licensees to participate in the creation
of a pool of SBA-guaranteed Debentures, against which a public offering of SBA-guaranteed trust or pool certificates,
each evidencing a fractional interest in the pool, is made to long-term investors. Such pools are formed and certificates
sold every three months, give or take a few days. Preceding the closing of the sale of the pool certificates there is
a ten-day period during which no more Debentures may be considered for inclusion in the pool. During that ten-day period,
the rate of interest on Debentures or of Prioritized Payments on Participating Securities is determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a Licensee requests a draw, it will be deemed to have authorized SBA to guarantee its security immediately, and
to have authorized SBA, acting as the Licensee's agent, to sell such security to a short-term investor that will agree
to hold the Licensee's security until the Licensee's security is put into the next pool, or is repurchased by the Licensee,
or is repurchased by SBA because of a definitive determination based on subsequently-received adverse information
concerning the Licensee's credit or regulatory status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the security is a Debenture, it will be sold to a short-term investor at a discount, calculated as if the maturity
date of the Debenture were the next scheduled closing date for the sale of pool certificates. The Licensee will also
agree to the payment of additional interest to the short-term investor, at the same rate used to calculate the discount,
for each day that the sale of pool certificates is delayed beyond the scheduled date. While payment to the short-term
investor of all interest accrued from the date of sale to the actual closing date shall be the responsibility of the
Licensee, it shall be guaranteed by SBA. The Licensee's failure to make full payment of such additional interest shall
constitute an event giving rise to a condition affecting the Licensee's good standing under SBA's regulations. If
the Licensee's security is a Participating Security, the same conditions will apply, however, the Participating
Security will be sold to a short-term investor at a price equal to the face amount thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although SBA guarantees the Licensee's undertaking to the short-term investor concerning payment of interest on
a Debenture or Prioritized Payments on a Participating Security on the date such Debenture or Participating Security
is pooled, the Licensee does not warrant, nor does SBA guarantee, that pooling will take place on any specific date.
The short-term investor assumes the risk that the recovery of its invested principal and the receipt of interest or
Prioritized Payments will be delayed to the extent that the pool closing is delayed. Based on historical experience,
it is unlikely that any such delay will occur and if it does, the duration of the delay should be minimal. The rate at which
the Licensee's Debenture will be discounted or at which the Prioritized Payments will accumulate on a Participating
Security when either of these securities are sold to a short-term investor will, in both cases, be determined with
reference to the current average market yield on obligations of the United States with comparable periods to maturity.
However, for the purpose of determining the rate of interest or of Prioritized Payments payable to a short-term investor,
``maturity'' refers to the next scheduled pooling date, not the stated maturity date of the security in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the normal course of events, when the sale of pool certificates closes, the Licensee's security will be included
in the pool, having been purchased, as previously agreed, from the short-term investor with the Licensee's share
of the proceeds of the sale of SBA guaranteed certificates issued against the pool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor with SBA's guaranty does not obligate SBA to include that
security in a pool of long-term securities in disregard of subsequently-obtained information calling into question
either the Licensee's financial soundness or the Licensee's compliance with applicable regulations. If SBA determines
to withhold its guarantee of the Licensee's security to the pool, SBA will purchase the Licensee's security from the
short-term investor on or before the pool closing date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sale of the Licensee's security to a short-term investor with SBA's guaranty does not cut off the Licensee's right
to withdraw its security from entering into the pool by repurchasing it directly from the short-term investor if notice
is given to SBA at least ten days prior to the pool cut-off date. However, since the sale of the Licensee's security to
a short-term investor, and not the subsequent pooling of the security, is the event that discharges SBA from its reservation
obligation to the extent of the security's face amount, the Licensee's subsequent repurchase of its security from
the short-term investor does not re-obligate SBA under the terms of its commitment, or restore SBA's guarantee authority
to the extent of the face amount of the repurchased security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA's approval of an application for a commitment does not lock in any interest or Prioritized Payment rate, nor does
SBA's guarantee of a security sold to a short-term investor indicate in any way what the Licensee's interest or Prioritized
Payment rate will be when the security is pooled and certificates are sold to long-term investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once in the hands of the pool trustee, the Licensee's Debenture or Participating Security will assume all the terms
and characteristics of the other securities in the pool, including an interest or Prioritized Payment rate recalculated
with reference to the maturities of the other securities being pooled.

This final regulation will impose an additional record-keeping requirement on those Licensees that voluntarily
avail themselves of the benefit of this final rule. Viewing the matter from the Licensee's standpoint, the additional
burden of preparing a quarterly short-form financial statement is offset by the assurance of the future availability
of Leverage and the reduction of cost resulting from elimination of the need to draw down Leverage funds long before
they may be invested in Small Concerns. From SBA's standpoint, the additional record-keeping is necessary if SBA
is not to rely upon out-dated financial information when its funds draws against its commitment.

A request for a draw, which may be submitted at any time, is submitted in the form of a request that the Licensee's Preferred
Security be purchased by SBA; or that its Debenture or Participating Security be guaranteed by SBA, sold to a short-term
investor and subsequently included in the next pool for which the Licensee's securities are eligible. The following
documentation shall accompany each such request for a draw:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If such request is submitted within 30 days following the close of the Licensee's fiscal quarter, the request shall
be accompanied by a Financial Statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) reflecting the Licensee's condition as of the
close of that fiscal quarter; otherwise, the request shall be accompanied by a formal statement of no material adverse
change in financial condition since the filing of the most recent SBA Form 468 (Long or Short Form).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A certified statement executed by an officer of the Licensee or of a corporate general partner of the Licensee,
or by an individual that is authorized to act as or for a general partner of the Licensee, as the case may be, representing
that to the best of its knowledge and belief the Licensee is in compliance with all provisions of the Act and SBA regulations
(i.e., no unresolved regulatory or statutory violations) or a statement as to the specific nature of any violations
of which it is aware.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A statement that the proceeds are needed to fund a particular Small Concern, which statement shall also include
the name and address of the Small Concern, the amount of the Licensee's proposed Financing, and the scheduled closing

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Airbus Model A320 series airplanes.
This action requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to instruct
the flight crew to maintain a flap setting of configuration full (CONF FULL) during landing. This amendment is prompted
by a report of severe control difficulties which occurred on approach with the flaps locked in CONF FULL and the landing
gear down. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane
during approach.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA received a report that a Model A320 series airplane experienced severe control difficulties on
approach with the flaps locked in configuration full (CONF FULL) and the landing gear down. In this incident, the Electronic
Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) system directed the flight crew to select configuration (CONF) 3 for landing.
When the flight crew placed the slats/flaps lever in CONF 3, the slats retracted from 27 degrees to 22 degrees, but the
flaps remained locked in the full position (40 degrees). Consequently, the flight crew engaged the autopilot, which
resulted in the lateral control laws responding to the corresponding CONF 3. In turbulent conditions, this configuration
may lead to serious lateral oscillation with the autopilot engaged or to an increase of the lateral sensitivity in
manual control. This condition, if not corrected, could result in severely reduced controllability of the airplane
during approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus has issued A320/A321 Flight Manual Temporary Revision 9.99.99/20, dated June 14, 1994, which provides the
flight crew with modified procedures for flaps fault/locked condition. These modified procedures instruct the
flight crew to maintain CONF FULL during landing approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation
Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent severely reduced controllability of the
airplane during approach. The FAA has determined that this unsafe condition may be temporarily addressed by revising
the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise the flight crew to maintain CONF FULL during
landing approaches. This AFM revision is to be accomplished in accordance with the information specified in the Airbus
document described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved,
and available, the FAA may consider further rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``

'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;121&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its loan guaranty regulations to increase from $700 to $850 the
maximum allowable amount VA will reimburse a loan holder for the cost of trustee's fees and legal services incurred
by the holder in liquidating a loan guaranteed by VA. Increasing the maximum allowable amount will make it easier for
holders to retain experience legal counsel to perform required foreclosures in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 22, 1993, VA published in the Federal Register (58 FR 49253) proposed regulations on increasing the maximum
allowable amount VA will reimburse a loan holder for the cost of trustee's fees and legal services. Five comments were
received on the proposed amendments. Four commenters approved of the change. One commenter stated that increasing
the maximum allowable amount will not make it easier to retain experienced counsel in areas where the local VA offices
do not choose to reimburse attorneys the maximum allowable amount. This commenter further suggested that the local
offices be required to raise the amount they reimburse attorneys to the maximum allowable amount.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are adopted as originally proposed. The suggestion that regional offices be required to pay the maximum
allowable amount when they reimburse attorneys has not been adopted. We believe that local VA offices have the experience
and knowledge necessary to determine the appropriate level of attorney and trustee fees for foreclosure processing
in their various areas of jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that the final regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
Increasing the amount VA will reimburse holders for trustee's fees and legal services will make it easier for holders
to retain experienced legal counsel to perform required foreclosures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 15, 1994, we published a final rule implementing sections 9312(c)(2), 9312(f) and 9434(b) of Public Law 99&hyph;509,
section 7 of Public Law 100&hyph;93, section 4014 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, sections 224 and 411(k) of Public Law
100&hyph;360, and section 6411(d)(3) of Public Law 101&hyph;239. These provisions broadened the Secretary's authority
to impose intermediate sanctions and civil money penalties on health maintenance organizations (HMOs), competitive
medical plans and other prepaid health plans contracting under Medicare or Medicaid that (1) substantially fail
to provide an enrolled individual with required medically necessary items and services; (2) engage in certain marketing,
enrollment, reporting or claims payment abuses; or (3) in the case of Medicare risk-contracting plans, employ or
contract with, either directly or indirectly, an individual or entity excluded from participation in Medicare.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f)(1) The OIG may, in addition to or in lieu of other remedies available under law, impose a penalty of up to $25,000
for each determination by HCFA that a contracting organization has_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Failed substantially to provide an enrollee with required medically necessary items and services and the failure
adversely affects (or has the likelihood of adversely affecting) the enrollee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Imposed premiums on enrollees in excess of amounts permitted under section 1876 or title XIX of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Acted to expel or to refuse to re-enroll a Medicare beneficiary in violation of the provisions of section 1876
of the Act and for reasons other than the beneficiary's health status or requirements for health care services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Misrepresented or falsified information furnished to an individual or any other entity under section 1876 or
section 1903(m) of the Act; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Failed to comply with the requirements of section 1876(g)(6)(A) of the Act regarding prompt payment of claims.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The OIG may, in addition to or in lieu of other remedies available under law, impose a penalty of up to $25,000 for
each determination by HCFA that a contracting organization with a contract under section 1876 of the Act_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Employs or contracts with individuals or entities excluded, under section 1128 or section 1128A of the Act, from

services; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Acted to expel or to refuse to re-enroll a Medicaid recipient because of the individual's health status or requirements
for health care services, or engaged in any practice that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of denying
or discouraging enrollment (except as permitted by section 1876 or section 1903(m) of the Act) with the contracting
organization by Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients whose medical condition or history indicates a
need for substantial future medical services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If enrolles are charged more than the allowable premium, the OIG will impose an additional penalty equal to double
the amount of excess premium charged by the contracting organization. The excess premium amount will be deducted
from the penalty and returned to the enrollee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The OIG will impose an additional $15,000 penalty for each individual not enrolled when HCFA determines that a
contracting organization has committed a violation described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, a violation is each incident where a person has committed an act listed
in &sect;417.500(a) or &sect;434.67(a) of this title, or failed to comply with a requirement set forth in &sect;434.80(c)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) In considering the factors listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, for violations subject to a determination
under &sect;1003.103(f), the following circumstances are to be considered, as appropriate, in determining the
amount of any penalty_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nature and circumstances of the incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It would be considered a mitigating circumstance if, where more than one violation exists, the appropriate items
or services not provided were_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Few in number, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Of the same type and occurred within a short period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if such items or services were of several types and occurred
over a lengthy period of time, or if there were many such items or services (or the nature and circumstances indicate
a pattern of such items or services not being provided). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Degree of culpability. It would be considered a mitigating circumstance if the violation was the result of an unintentional,
unrecognized error, and corrective action was taken promptly after discovery of the error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to provide required care. It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if the failure to provide
required care was attributable to an individual or entity that the contracting organization is expressly prohibited
by law from contracting with or employing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Use of excluded individuals. It would be considered an aggravating factor if the contracting organization knowingly
or routinely engages in the prohibited practice of contracting or employing, either directly or indirectly, individuals
or entities excluded from the Medicare program under section 1128 or section 1128A of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Routine practices. It would be considered an aggravating factor if the contracting organization knowingly or
routinely engages in any discriminatory or other prohibited practice which has the effect of denying or discouraging
enrollment by individuals whose medical condition or history indicates a need for substantial future medical services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Prior offenses. It would be considered an aggravating circumstance if at any time prior to determination of the
current violation or violations, the contracting organization or any of its principals was convicted on criminal
charges or held liable for civil or administrative sanctions in connection with a program covered by this part or any
other public or private program of payment for medical services. The lack of prior liability for criminal, civil,
or administrative sanctions by the contracting organization, or the principals of the contracting organization,
would not necessarily be considered a mitigating circumstance in determining civil money penalty amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (1) The standards set forth in this section are binding, except to the extent that their application would result
in imposition of an amount that would exceed limits imposed by the United States Constitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount imposed will not be less than the approximate amount required to fully compensate the United States,
or any State, for its damages and costs, tangible and intangible, including but not limited to the costs attributable
to the investigation, prosecution, and administrative review of the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nothing in this section will limit the authority of the Department to settle any issue or case as provided by &sect;1003.126,
or to compromise any penalty and assessment as provided by &sect;1003.128.

The Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Cost Accounting Standards Board, revised the applicability, thresholds
and procedures for the application of Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) to negotiated government contracts, on Thursday,
November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58798). The Board is taking action to avoid confusion with CAS requirements appearing at 48
CFR 9903.201&hyph;1, CAS applicability, and 48 CFR 9903.201&hyph;2, Types of CAS coverage. The change addresses
the current conflicting language that concerns contracts and subcontracts with foreign governments.

 This rule prescribes special late season migratory bird hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian
reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands. This is in response to tribal requests for Service recognition
of their authority to regulate hunting under established guidelines. This rule is necessary to allow establishment
of season bag limits and, thus, harvest at levels compatible with populations and habitat conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 42017), the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations
for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season for certain Indian tribes, under the guidelines described in the June 4, 1985,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved
hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both tribal members and
nonmembers on their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting by both
tribal members and nonmembers, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal
frameworks but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation hunting by
tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession
limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season
length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established
under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10&hyph;September 1 closed season mandated by the
1916 Convention on the Protection of Migratory Birds Between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada). Tribes that
desired special hunting regulations in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season were requested in the April 7, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16762) to submit a proposal that included details on: (1) requested season dates and other regulations to be
observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure
or monitor harvest; (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit
such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and (5) tribal capabilities to establish and
enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. No action is required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations
that are established by the State(s) in which an Indian reservation is located. The guidelines have been used successfully
since the 1985&hyph;86 hunting season, and they were made final beginning with the 1988&hyph;89 hunting season (August
18, 1988; 53 FR 31612).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the August 16, 1994, proposed rule included generalized regulations for both early and late season hunting,
this rulemaking addresses only the late season proposals. Early season hunting was addressed in the rulemaking published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45235). As a general rule, early seasons begin during September each year and have a primary
emphasis on such species as mourning and white-winged dove. Late seasons are ordinarily those that begin in late-September
or early-October, or later, each year and have a primary emphasis on waterfowl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 16 proposed rule, and in the early season final rule, the Service pointed out that there was reason for
cautious optimism with regard to liberalization of duck hunting regulations in the 1994&hyph;95 season. However,
at that time production information was not available and assessments could not be made on which to base final framework
decisions. From survey data, it now appears that duck production is up on a continental basis, with a projected fall
flight index of about 71 million ducks, and the Service has responded to this by making minor adjustments in regulations.
Most notably, bag limit frameworks provide for one more duck than allowed last year, with an additional mallard drake.
However, the restriction on mallard hens to one in the daily bag will remain in effect. A season on canvasbacks is optional
nationwide. Other species restrictions are still in effect. The Service has eased, somewhat, the more restrictive
regulations of past seasons because duck populations have generally rebounded from the lows of last year and several
previous years. Duck populations recovery is closely linked to more favorable water conditions throughout most
of the better duck production areas of the U.S. and Canada, as well as to more restrictive regulations imposed in the
past. However, the Service has been conservative in this liberalization because the potential is there for a more
complete recovery of populations in the future, compared to long-term averages, if water conditions stabilize and/or
continue to improve. Length of season is considered to be a factor more closely associated with determining magnitude
of harvest than is minor adjustment in bag limit so frameworks for season length across all four flyways will remain
the same. The fact that some liberalization has occurred in bag limits and season length is considered in these final
regulations, many of which were proposed before final decisions were made on late season frameworks for the States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season, the Service received requests from 14 tribes and/or Indian groups
that followed the June 4, 1985, guidelines and are appropriate for rulemaking. Some of the proposals submitted by
the tribes have both early and late season elements. However, as noted earlier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those with late season proposals are included in this final rulemaking; 13 tribes have proposals with late seasons.
Six tribes are represented in the early season regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There have been no tribal comments or revised proposals for the late seasons received since publication of the early
season final rule. However, tribal proposals were made before late-season final frameworks for States were established.
Thus, with the liberalization that has occurred, changes have been made in some of the tribal seasons that are not reflected
in the earlier proposed rule document.

Public Comments on Tribal Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service received a letter from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MIDNR), dated August 30, 1994, that
generally supports the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) migratory bird hunting proposal
in the 1836 and 1842 ceded areas of Michigan. The MIDNR did advise that State rules had been modified to limit the take
of brant to no more than two daily within a daily bag of seven geese. This was in response to a recent Mississippi Flyway
Council recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service's view on this is that the likelihood of a hunter taking, or even seeing, a brant in an interior area is not
very great given that brant are almost exclusively a marine species. Although they are seen on occasion, records indicate
the occurrence of brant in Michigan are on a ``rare'' to ``extremely rare'' basis. Establishment of a guideline or
regulation to restrict the daily bag limit of brant to two is somewhat meaningless in that context. Nevertheless,
as it would seem that the regulation is in part designed to protect the hunter, the Service will defer to the GLIFWC to
decide for next season how they will propose to respond to the Mississippi Flyway Council recommendation and the State
of Michigan establishment of regulations for brant harvest. For this current season, after consultation with both
the MIDNR and the GLIFWC, the potential problem has been taken care of through inclusion of brant in the ``Other Geese''
category of the GLIFWC regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments from States regarding tribally proposed regulations, received earlier, were addressed in the early
season final rule published on September 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, this rule amends section 20.110 of 50 CFR to make current for the late 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting
season the regulations that will apply on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands.
These regulations take into account the liberalization that the Service has determined is biologically feasible
for this current season, based on improved production.

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The
Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes
of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out *&blank;*&blank;* is not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction
or adverse modification of [critical] habitat *&blank;*&blank;*'' Consequently, the Service initiated Section
7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act for the proposed migratory bird hunting seasons including those
which occur on Federally recognized Indian reservations and ceded lands. The Service's biological opinion resulting
from its consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be inspected by the public in, and will be available
to the public from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Office of Migratory Bird Management,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240. Copies of these documents are

ADDRESSES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an August 1994 opinion, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats.

Regulations Promulgation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting must, by its very nature, operate under severe time constraints.
However, the Service is of the view that every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possible opportunity
to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed hunting regulations for certain tribes were published on August
16, 1994, the Service established the longest possible period for public comments. In doing this, the Service recognized
that time would be of the essence. However, the comment period provided the maximum amount of time possible while ensuring
that this final rule would be published before the late hunting season beginning on September 24, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, as amended (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Service prescribes final hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian reservations (including
off-reservation trust lands), and ceded lands. The regulations specify the species to be hunted and establish season
dates, bag and possession limits, season length, and shooting hours for migratory game birds other than waterfowl.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons set out above, the Service finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C.
553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and this final rule will take effect on September 24, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) While hunting waterfowl, a tribal member must carry on his/her person a valid tribal waterfowl hunting permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as otherwise noted, tribal members will be required to comply with tribal codes that will be no less restrictive
than the provisions of Chapter 10 of the Model Off-Reservation Code. Except as may be modified by Service final rules
adopted in response to a proposed rule, these amended regulations parallel Federal requirements, 50 CFR Part 20,
and shooting hour regulations in 50 CFR Part 20, subpart K, as to hunting methods, transportation, sale, exportation
and other conditions generally applicable to migratory bird hunting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Tribal members in each zone will comply with State regulations providing for closed and restricted waterfowl
hunting areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Minnesota and Michigan_Duck Blinds and Decoys. Tribal members hunting in Minnesota will comply with tribal codes
that contain provisions parallel to M. S. 100.29, Subd. 18 (duck blinds and decoys). Tribal members hunting in Michigan
will comply with tribal codes that contain provisions parallel to Michigan law regarding duck blinds and decoys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Possession limits for each species are double the daily bag limit, except on the opening day of the season, when
the possession limit equals the daily bag limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Possession limits are applicable only to transportation and do not include birds which are cleaned, dressed,
and at a member's primary residence. For purposes of enforcing bag and possession limits, all migratory birds in the
possession or custody of tribal members on ceded lands will be considered to have been taken on those lands unless tagged
by a tribal or State conservation warden as having been taken on-reservation. In Wisconsin, such tagging will comply
with Sec. NR 19.12, Wis. Adm. Code. All migratory birds which fall on reservation lands will not count as part of any
off-reservation bag or possession limit.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that the 33 metric tons (mt) set-aside for the late-season General category quota beginning September
15, will be taken by September 16, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed effective at 1200 hours
on Saturday, September 17, 1994, except that 8 mt will remain available for the New York Bight fishery beginning September
20, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found
at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt
of large medium and giant ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the General category.
Of this amount, 65 mt are to be set aside for a late-season fishery beginning September 15. Based on landings statistics,
the fishery was closed on August 15, 1994, with only 23 mt remaining for the late-season set-aside. A reallocation
of 18 mt from the reserve increased the set-aside to 41 mt, of which 33 mt were allocated to General category fishermen
from all areas to be fished from September 15 through September 17, and 8 mt were allocated to the New York Bight fishery
to be fished from September 20 until the 8 mt are taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on early landing reports, it has been determined that the late-season quota of ABT allocated for the General
category will be exceeded by greater than 100 percent if the fishery remains open for the planned 3 days. However, given
the need to provide sufficient notice to vessels already at sea, and out of equity and safety concerns for fishermen
returning to port with legally-caught bluefin, it has been decided to effect the closure as of noon on Saturday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishing for, retention of, possessing, or landing large medium or giant ABT by vessels in the General category must
cease by 1200 hours September 17, 1994. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the quota to such an extent
that subtractions of the overage would seriously and adversely impact the 1995 fishery for this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This closure of the late-season General category fishery will not affect the 8 mt set-aside for the New York Bight or
other categories fishing for ABT. As of this date, the Incidental, Angling, and Harpoon categories remain open, and
the Purse Seine category is subject to individual quotas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendments made in this rule do not affect the information collection requirements for the Single Family Property
Disposition program, which were previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork
Reduction Act and assigned OMB control numbers 2502&hyph;0306.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title II of the National Housing Act (the Act) authorizes HUD to insure mortgages for single family residences through
the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance program. The disposition program for
single family properties, acquired by HUD in exchange for payment of insurance claims, is authorized by section 204(g)
of the Act. The regulations governing the disposition program are codified at 24 CFR part 291. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 20, 1993, the Department published an interim rule, which subsequently became effective on November 19,
1993, amending certain provisions of part 291 to allow for greater flexibility in fluctuating market situations
and to provide greater opportunities for affordable housing to families and to State and local governments or nonprofit
organizations serving low- and moderate-income families. The purpose of the amendments was to implement the policy
of President Clinton and Secretary Cisneros to expand access to affordable homeownership and help revitalize neighborhoods.

II. Amendments Made by Interim Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Single Family Property Disposition (24 CFR Part 291) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The purpose of the disposition program was changed to place greater emphasis on homeownership and improvement
of neighborhoods, by providing that the primary objective of the program is to reduce the inventory of acquired properties
in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures
a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund. (24 CFR 291.1(a).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A definition of ``revitalization areas'' was added, which defined the term as urban neighborhoods that are targeted
by a city for coordinating affordable housing programs and enhanced supportive services, and where a significant
number of HUD-owned properties have been in inventory at least six months. (24 CFR 291.5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Purchase money mortgages (PMMs) in revitalization areas were made available for 85 percent of the purchase price,
at current market interest rates, for a period not to exceed five years for direct sale purchasers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations) meeting FHA mortgage credit standards and purchasing
properties for ultimate resale to owner-occupant purchasers at or below 115 percent of median income. (24 CFR 291.100(d).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The definition of owner-occupant purchaser was amended to limit it to purchasers who intend to occupy the property
as their primary residence. (The rule had previously included governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations
as owner-occupant purchasers.) (24 CFR 291.5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Owner-occupant purchasers were given a priority in the competitive bid sales method. In revitalization areas,
the priority was made available for up to 30 days and only for properties offered with FHA mortgage insurance. In all
other areas, the priority was made available for all properties for a period of time to be set by the field office, depending
on local circumstances. (24 CFR 291.105(a).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The limitation on the amount of financing and closing costs that HUD pays was removed, and the rule was amended to
provide that HUD will determine the maximum limit appropriate for the area. (24 CFR 291.105(b).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The discount available on direct sale purchases was changed from 10 percent to an amount to be determined appropriate
by HUD, but not less than 10 percent, depending on the location of the property or the number of properties purchased
in a single transaction. (24 CFR 291.110 (a) and (b).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The procedure by which potential purchasers under the direct sales program are notified of eligible properties
was amended. (24 CFR 291.110(a).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A provision was added to allow for a direct sale to an individual or other entity not otherwise specified in the rule
where a finding is made, in writing, that such a sale would further the goals of the National Housing Act and would be
in the best interests of the Secretary. (24 CFR 291.110(g).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The rule was amended to permit initial 15-day extensions for closing at no cost to owner-occupant purchasers where
documentation indicates that (1) proper and timely loan application was made, (2) the delay is not the fault of the
buyer, and (3) mortgage approval is imminent. A further amendment allowed extensions at no cost, at any time and to
any purchaser, where the delay is the fault of HUD or a direct endorsement lender. (24 CFR 291.130(b).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. An amendment was made to provide that, in the case of an uninsured sale, 100 percent of an earnest money deposit made
by an owner-occupant purchaser will be returned where the purchaser is pre-approved for mortgage financing in an
appropriate amount by a recognized mortgage lender and, despite good faith efforts, is unable to obtain mortgage
financing; and, where an owner-occupant purchaser has not been preapproved and despite good faith efforts cannot
obtain mortgage financing, 50 percent of the earnest money deposit will be returned. (24 CFR 291.135.) A definition
of ``pre-approved'' was added to mean that a commitment has been obtained from a recognized mortgage lender for mortgage
financing in a specified dollar amount sufficient to purchase the property. (24 CFR 291.5.)

Occupied Conveyance (24 CFR Part 203) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The occupied conveyance rule at 24 CFR 203.670 and 203.671 was amended to provide that HUD may accept occupied properties
to avoid the payment of excessive eviction or relocation expenses required by a local government. A technical correction
was also being made to &sect;&sect;203.675(b)(4) and 203.676 to conform with an earlier amendment to the rule published
on September 16, 1991 (56 FR 46964) regarding the conveyance of properties occupied by persons who suffer a long-term
or permanent illness.

III. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 40 public comments during the 60-day comment period that ended on December 20, 1993. The comments
were from governmental entities, private nonprofit organizations, and three members of Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments are discussed below. Numbers in parentheses following the comment refer to the number of commenters
raising the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD should continue to give a priority to purchase (and lease, in the case of homeless providers) to nonprofits and
government agencies, particularly grantees under HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family Homes (HOPE 3). (36) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that changes to its procedures for offering properties to governmental entities and nonprofit
organizations are appropriate. The final rule has been changed to include governmental entities and nonprofit organizations
in the definition of owner-occupant purchasers, thereby giving them a simultaneous opportunity to purchase properties
eligible for FHA mortgage insurance during the competitive bidding period. If a nonprofit or government agency submits
the highest net offer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
without
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 any discount being considered, and that offer is otherwise acceptable, it will be accepted and a discount of 10 percent
(15 percent if five or more properties are purchased and closed simultaneously), regardless of the property's location,
will be applied at closing. For properties not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, nonprofits and government agencies
will have first opportunity to purchase at HUD's determination of fair market value. Offers accepted will reflect
the appropriate discount. For properties offered without FHA mortgage insurance, the discount will be 30 percent
in revitalization areas, and 10 percent in all other areas (or 15 percent, as appropriate). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In establishing revitalization areas, the number of FHA foreclosures in process should be taken into consideration
rather than the number of properties currently on hand. (7) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Due to the several uncertainties surrounding foreclosures (payoff by mortgagor, purchase by third parties, bankruptcy,
redemption periods, the varying length of time in which foreclosure occurs, etc.), the Department believes that
the use of foreclosures in process is not practical in establishing revitalization areas. The Department continues
to believe it is appropriate to establish revitalization areas based on experience with its property disposition
program and based on areas designated by localities for expanding affordable housing opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The discount in revitalization areas should be greater. (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The available discount is based on anticipated savings to the Department, both in terms of selling on a direct basis
and in selling properties more quickly that may otherwise require extended periods of marketing. The amount is supported
by an evaluation performed on the Single Family Property Disposition Demonstration Program conducted by the Department
on sales of properties in economically distressed areas. The Department believes that the current discount level
is appropriate, but retains flexibility in making future determinations based on changing housing market conditions.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There should be a requirement for owner-occupant buyers to repair to code. (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that such a requirement, and its enforcement, properly rests with the local government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The program should be monitored and reports provided to the public. (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not believe there is an urgent need to devote already scarce resources to large scale monitoring
of this unsubsidized program. To the extent the Department learns of falsification of the Sales Contract, or other
abuses in the program, corrective measures will be taken at that time. In this regard, steps have been taken to determine
the appropriateness of having the Department's computer system perform limited checking on owner-occupants purchasing
more than one principal residence. Also, the Sales Contract now includes a warning to purchasers about the possible
consequences of falsifying that document. The Department has recently authorized Field Offices to include resale
restrictions on certain properties to prevent windfall profits and require that the properties be used for affordable
housing goals. A provision has been added to the final rule at &sect;291.110(a)(3) to authorize the Department to
request information when considered appropriate on the disposition of properties sold to governmental entities
and nonprofits. Consideration is also being given to other administrative procedures to prevent abuse from all categories
of buyers.

 Minimum residency requirements for owner-occupant buyers should be established. (2)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not agree that such requirements should be established. Unnecessary hardships could be placed
on owner-occupants in some cases where job relocations or other circumstances may necessitate moving. As discussed
above, the Department has taken some measures already, and is considering others, to prevent possible abuses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonprofit organizations are currently eligible to purchase discounted properties based on differing pre-qualification
standards. While the Department believes it would not be in its best interests to require a second approval, nonprofits
not previously approved under another HUD program will generally be subject to requirements much like those used
in the HOPE 3 program as a condition to purchasing properties at discounted prices. (See the HOPE 3 regulations at 24
CFR part 572.) In addition, the Department may specify a required minimum number of properties to be completed successfully,
before the purchase of additional properties.

In pricing HUD properties, appraisers should use distressed properties as comparables. (2)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD believes its procedure for pricing properties, regardless of their location, is a fair one. Appraisers utilize
recent sales of comparable properties in similar condition, and HUD's listing price is reflective of the needed level
of repairs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's Field Offices are required by &sect;291.110(a) to provide lists of properties available for direct purchase
upon request. Where Field Offices have provided lists routinely, they have not been instructed to discontinue the
practice, and some are continuing that practice. To eliminate unnecessary and duplicative work, however, some offices
may elect to have the newspaper advertisement, where such advertising is used, also serve as official notification
to the nonprofits and government agencies. In areas where newspapers are not used to advertise properties, other
means must be used to notify nonprofits and government agencies of available properties in a timely manner. In those
instances where properties being offered without FHA mortgage insurance are first made available to nonprofits
and government agencies, Field Offices will continue to provide lists directly to those potential purchasers. The
Department does not believe this practice creates a hardship on program participants.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe such a process is necessary and, in fact, could serve to undermine the authority vested
in HUD's Field Offices. HUD headquarters will continue to oversee the program and to discuss issues with both the buyer
community and its Field Offices in order to reach fair and appropriate decisions. The Department does not see the necessity
of a formal appeal process to accomplish this.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that restricting sales only to buyers under a specific income limit could be viewed as discriminatory,
unfair to other owner-occupant buyers, and not in the best interests of the Department or the FHA insurance fund, in
its efforts to dispose of the inventory in a timely manner and at the maximum return to the insurance funds. Changes
made in this final rule to give a priority purchase period to governmental agencies and nonprofits on certain properties
will enhance the opportunity of low-income purchasers to acquire properties through programs sponsored by those
agencies and organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has significantly restricted the opportunity for investors to purchase. In the case of properties
eligible for FHA mortgage insurance (those generally in better condition), owner-occupants (which includes nonprofits
and government agencies) have first opportunity to purchase. For properties not eligible for FHA mortgage insurance,
the nonprofits and government agencies have first opportunity to purchase, followed by other owner-occupant buyers,
before being offered to all purchasers. It should be kept in mind that there will be certain properties, due to their
physical condition, that will not be purchased by any owner-occupant purchaser, so it would not be in the best interests
of the Department to eliminate totally the investor buyer from this program.

A discount in the sales price should be given to owner-occupants who have received certificates for completing homebuyer
education seminars. (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Department recognizes the value of homeownership counseling programs, it does not believe the suggestion
would be in its best interests. It is unlikely that there would be any ``standard'' by which certificates would be issued
to potential buyers by the many different organizations providing such counseling. Further, the discount offered
by HUD is justified primarily by the savings to the Department on direct sales to nonprofits and government agencies.
These same savings (sales commission, closing/financing costs, and expected holding costs) would not be realized
in sales to other than direct sale buyers. Although the Department will not sell to owner-occupant buyers that are
not government agencies or nonprofits at discounted prices, properties purchased at the deep discount by those organizations
are primarily intended to be resold to persons who are at or below 115 percent of median income for their area, when adjusted
for family size, or used to shelter the homeless. Therefore, the program will enhance affordable homeownership opportunities.

Consideration should be given to accepting purchase offers from direct sale buyers that are below asking price. (1)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action clearly would not be in the Department's best interests. At the time properties are available for direct
purchase, the asking prices are based on very recent appraisals and the Department has no reason to believe those prices
are not reflective of true market value. To accept offers below those prices would effectively increase the discount
the Department is willing to provide and undermine the return to the mortgage insurance funds. If properties remain
available at the time of offering to the general public, those buyers who previously could purchase direct then have
the opportunity to bid competitively and may, in fact, submit offers below the asking price at that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Homeless providers should be permitted to purchase only in nonrevitalization areas. (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An agency that is a homeless provider (and may have leased properties from the Department for that purpose) often may
be the same nonprofit or government agency that can purchase on a direct basis. Such an agency has the right to purchase
properties it has leased, regardless of their location. Further, the Department does not see a legitimate reason
to restrict homeless providers only to nonrevitalization areas and believes that such action would be detrimental
to the goal of expanding homeownership opportunities.

IV. Other Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of an agreement with nonprofit organizations to place certain limits on the amount of required earnest
money deposits, thus alleviating possible hardships on owner-occupant purchasers, the Department has determined
that the amount of such a deposit on a property with a sales price of $50,000 or less shall be $500, except that for vacant
lots the amount shall be 50 percent of the list price. For a property with a sales price greater than $50,000, the deposit
shall be set by the Field Office in an amount not less than $500 or more than $2,000. This amendment is made in this final
rule at &sect;291.105(h)(1).

the amount of earnest money deposit required in the area is set by the Field Office, in an amount not less than $500 or
more than $2,000. In determining the amount of earnest money deposits, a Field Office considers comparable practice
in the locality, area real estate market conditions, the type of offers generally received, and the ability of the
area's typical buyers to secure financing. Information on the amount of the required earnest money deposit is available
from the Field Office or participating real estate brokers.

(a)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct sales of properties without mortgage insurance to governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) State and local governments, public agencies, and qualified private nonprofit organizations that have been
preapproved to participate by HUD, according to standards determined by the Secretary, may purchase properties
directly from HUD at a discount off the list price determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, but not less than 10
percent, for use in HUD and local housing or homeless programs. The amount of the discount may vary, depending on the
area, the type of sale, or the number of properties purchased and closed in a single transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must designate geographical areas of interest, by ZIP code,
to appropriate HUD Field Offices. Upon request, for those properties not eligible for mortgage insurance, and before
they are publicly listed, Field Offices will notify governmental entities and nonprofit organizations in writing
when eligible properties become available in the areas designated by them. Field Offices will coordinate the dissemination
of the information to ensure that where more than one purchaser designates a specific area, those purchasers receive
the list of properties at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the purchasers. Properties
will be sold on a first come-first served basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must notify HUD of preliminary interest in specific properties
within five days of the notification of available properties (where notification is by mail, the five days will begin
to run five days after mailing). Those properties in which purchasers express an interest will be held off the market
for a ten-day consideration and inspection period. Other properties on the list will continue to be processed for
public sale. HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for a purchaser at any one time, based upon the
purchaser's financial capacity as determined by HUD and upon past performance in HUD programs. At the end of the ten-day
consideration and inspection period, properties in which no governmental entity or nonprofit organization has
expressed a specific intent to purchase will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. Properties in
which a governmental entity or nonprofit organization expressed an intent to purchase, during the ten-day period,
will continue to be held off the market pending receipt of the sales contract. If a sales contract is not received within
a time period of up to ten days, as determined by HUD, following expiration of the ten-day consideration and inspection
period, and no other governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed an interest, then the property
will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In order to ensure that properties purchased at a discount are being utilized for expanding affordable housing
opportunities, HUD may require, as appropriate, periodic, limited information regarding the purchase and resale
of such properties, and certain restrictions on the resale of such properties.

The final rule amending the regulations contained in 25 CFR Part 11 to add the Muskogee Area Tribes (Eastern Oklahoma)
to the list of tribes in Section 11.100(a) became effective January 28, 1992. Notice of a proposed rule amending the
regulations contained in 25 CFR Part 11 to add the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe (Colorado), was published April 26, 1993.
The Ute Mountain Ute Tribe should have been included on the list contained in the revision of 25 CFR Part 11, published
October 21, 1993, at 25 CFR 11.100(a). The final rule, 25 CFR Part 11, listing tribes located in the former Oklahoma
Territory, published October 21, 1993, did not contain the Ponca Tribe (Oklahoma). These additions to 25 CFR Part

 In general, the Department will sell both current mortgages and delinquent mortgages. However, the Department will
not sell delinquent mortgages if foreclosure is unavoidable and the project securing the mortgage is occupied by
low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance and would be likely to pay rent in excess of 30 percent
of their adjusted monthly income if HUD sold the mortgage. In addition, mortgages on subsidized properties will only
be sold with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance or equivalent tenant protections; mortgages
for unsubsidized projects may be sold without FHA insurance.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On April 13, 1994, the Department published a proposed rule on the sale of HUD-held multifamily mortgages (59 FR 17500).
Two days earlier, on April 11, 1994, President Clinton approved the Multifamily Property Disposition Reform Act
of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;233) (Multifamily Property Disposition Act). Section 101(b) of the Multifamily Property
Disposition Act revised section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 1701z&hyph;11)
(HCD Amendments of 1978). This final rule incorporates technical changes to section 203 of the HCD Amendments of 1978,
as amended by section 101(b) of the Multifamily Property Disposition Act, as those provisions affect the sale of HUD-held
mortgages. HUD will be publishing, shortly, an interim rule to implement the statutory amendments affecting the
management and disposition of HUD-owned multifamily projects.

Summary of Comments_Generally
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department received a total of 11 comments on this proposed rule. The majority of the comments dealt with features
of the Department's planned mortgage sale program rather than with specifics of the proposed rule. However, two commenters
made recommendations regarding the negotiated sale of subsidized mortgages to State and local governments, and
one commenter recommended changes to the proposed rule. All of the comments are discussed in more detail below, and,
when appropriate, are addressed in the text of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only the National Housing Law Project (NHLP) focused specifically upon the text of the proposed rule. The NHLP acknowledged
HUD's authority to sell HUD-held mortgages, but urged that ``the utmost care should be taken to ensure that low-income
tenants do not lose benefits to which they are entitled.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the sale of subsidized mortgages with insurance, the NHLP stated that: ``The mere act of selling with
insurance will not necessarily by itself satisfy the statutory goal of continuing the protections for each project
that are at least as advantageous as the prior program's.'' The NHLP sought assurance that, at a minimum, the regulatory
protections contained in, for example, the regulatory agreement, note, and program regulations also would apply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This concern is consistent with the Department's intent to preserve existing tenant protections. Consequently,
the rule has been modified to include statutory language prohibiting the Secretary from selling any mortgages held
by the Secretary on any subsidized project unless the sale is made part of a transaction that ensures that the project
will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the loan or mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental
housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program under
which the original loan or mortgage was made or insured. In other words, sale of a HUD-held subsidized mortgage will
not affect the existing regulatory agreement, prepayment restrictions, flexible subsidy agreements, rental subsidy
contracts, or other applicable program regulations and housing policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHLP also sought clarification that purchase money mortgages (PMMs) for previously subsidized projects will
be treated like subsidized mortgages. The Department so intends and has modified the rule to make this evident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHLP requested that a project with any project-based Section 8 assistance be treated as a subsidized project and
be sold with insurance. However, doing so would be contrary to the Multifamily Property Disposition Act. In the Multifamily
Property Disposition Act, Congress revised the definition of a subsidized project for the mortgage sale program
(see section 203(b)(2)). Under the prior law (see section 203(i)(2)), a project that had any rent supplement assisted
units was a subsidized project. The requirement that more than 50 percent of the units had to be assisted for the project
to be a subsidized project applied only to assistance provided under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (other than
with certificate and voucher assistance). Finally, under the former law for purposes of mortgage sales, any unit
assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (other than certificate and voucher assistance) made the project
a subsidized project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new statutory definition of subsidized project, the more than 50 percent of the units provision applies
to all forms of project-based rental assistance listed. Also, there is no longer an exception from the 50 percent requirement
for mortgage sales. Thus, under the new law the definition of ``subsidized project'' is the same for the purpose of
disposing of HUD-owned projects and for mortgage sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``subsidized project'' in this final rule conforms to the statutory definition of ``subsidized
project.'' Accordingly, projects that are not Section 236, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, or Section 202 projects and have
some units, but not more than 50 percent of the units, assisted with project-based rental assistance are under both
the statute and the rule ``unsubsidized projects.'' However, the Department acknowledges that such partially assisted,
unsubsidized mortgages merit special treatment. Therefore, the Department plans to sell these mortgages in specialized
auctions to investors who will be selected, in part, on the basis of their commitment to preserving the economically
integrated nature of the rental housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHLP also suggested that unsubsidized projects with affordable rents be treated as though they were subsidized
and be sold with insurance. Adoption of this approach would be inconsistent with congressional direction. Therefore,
the Department must reject this approach. The statute defines ``subsidized project'' as a project that is receiving
assistance: (1) Under the section 221(d)(5) (Below Market Interest Rate) or the section 236 (Interest Reduction
Payments) programs; (2) under the section 202 direct loan program; or (3) in the form of rental assistance for more
than 50 percent of its units under the section 8, section 23, rent supplement or rental assistance payments (``RAP'')
programs. This rule merely adopts the statutory definition of ``subsidized project'' as the regulatory definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHLP recommended that HUD move certain statements regarding the availability of Section 8 assistance to tenants
in unsubsidized projects from the preamble of the proposed rule to the regulatory text. The statements in the preamble
describe HUD standards which are already addressed in other HUD regulations. As such, there is no need to repeat these
standards in the mortgage sale rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHLP asked why HUD would not sell mortgages without insurance to mortgagees that are HUD-approved as well as to
mortgagees that are not HUD-approved. In fact, HUD plans to offer the mortgages for sale to both types of mortgagees.
The NHLP also questioned the wisdom of selling mortgages to mortgagees that are not HUD-approved, on the ground that
HUD will have little regulatory leverage over such mortgagees. HUD expects that HUD's relationship with such mortgagees
will be governed by and enforceable under the terms and conditions of the loan sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHLP recommended that HUD impose certain requirements in the event that a delinquent mortgage is restructured
by a purchaser. Specifically, the NHLP recommended that the purchaser/mortgagor should agree:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Not to discriminate against Certificate and Voucher holders merely because of their status as Certificate or
Voucher holders;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To accept a project-based Section 8 contract if offered, as long as the rents charged at the project are within 120
percent of the Section 8 Fair Market Rents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To require good cause eviction for all tenants; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To require that the owner provide good repair and maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's ability to regulate a mortgage restructuring will depend upon whether the mortgage is subsidized or unsubsidized.
In the case of a delinquent subsidized mortgage, where the mortgage will be insured upon sale, HUD's oversight can
be expected to be close and prescriptive; however, in the case of delinquent unsubsidized mortgages, where the mortgages
will not be insured upon sale, HUD does not expect to regulate a mortgage restructuring closely.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In section 290.202(b) of the proposed rule, HUD stated that: ``Delinquent mortgages will not be sold if: (1) HUD believes
that foreclosure is unavoidable; and (2) the project securing the mortgage is occupied by low-income tenants who
are not receiving housing assistance, but who would receive assistance [under section 203 of the Housing and Community
Development Amendments of 1978] if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage.'' The NHLP recommended that HUD not sell delinquent
unsubsidized mortgages ``if it believes that foreclosure is unavoidable, and the project *&blank;*&blank;* is
occupied by low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance but could do so if HUD foreclosed upon the
mortgage.'' HUD has changed this section in the final rule to conform with the new Multifamily Property Disposition
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 203(a) of the prior law, HUD was directed to preserve as affordable all units in unsubsidized projects
that were occupied by low-income families. This statutory requirement was generally met at foreclosure or sale by
placing project-based Section 8 assistance on units that were occupied by low-income families. Thus, under the prior
law the import of &sect;290.202(b) would have been that, in general, HUD 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
would not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sell unsubsidized projects where foreclosure was unavoidable and there were unassisted low-income tenants in occupancy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new law, however, HUD is under no obligation when foreclosing or selling an unsubsidized project to provide
Section 8 assistance to low-income tenants if those tenants were not already receiving some form of tenant-based
assistance (see section 203(e)(1)(D)). HUD's only obligation upon foreclosure or sale in this regard (and it applies
only to very low-income families that would have to pay more than 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income for rent,
not to all low-income families) is to ensure that their rent is not increased for two years (see section 203(g)). These
low-income tenants would receive Section 8 assistance only if HUD makes an administrative decision to provide more
Section 8 assistance than is required by statute. Thus, the import of &sect;290.202(b) in the final rule is that HUD
generally 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
will
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sell unsubsidized projects where foreclosure was unavoidable and there are unassisted low-income tenants in occupancy.
HUD intends to foreclose delinquent unsubsidized mortgages only if it makes a determination that unassisted tenants
would receive assistance (including assistance available on a discretionary basis) if HUD were to foreclose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the NHLP recommended that HUD not sell delinquent, partially assisted, unsubsidized mortgages facing
foreclosure. As noted above, HUD acknowledges that these mortgages require special treatment, and they will be sold
only under conditions that preserve the rental housing for economically integrated rental use.

Negotiated Sales to State and Local Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA) and the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) responded
to HUD's request for comments on the negotiated sale of mortgages to State and local agencies authorized by section
203(k)(3) of the Housing and Community Development Act Amendments of 1978. Both strongly supported such sales and
described the unique qualifications that State housing finance agencies (HFAs) have to assist HUD in preserving
the availability and affordability of the projects securing the loans for low- and moderate-income rental use. Specific
comments and HUD's responses are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsidy Contracts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that HUD assign Section 8 subsidy contract administration to HFAs. HUD is willing to consider this
recommendation, subject to agreement on fees and the concern raised in conjunction with regulatory agreements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Agreements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that HUD assign broad regulatory authority to HFAs, including allowing HFAs to set rents and require
owners to enter into HFA management contracts. HUD is concerned that there is no mechanism for restraining costs if
the HFA performs financing and regulatory functions and also administers the Section 8 contract. HUD would like to
explore how to combine regulatory authority with incentives to contain costs. Otherwise it is HUD's view that States
may either administer Section 8 subsidy contracts or regulate rents, but not both, in order to preserve the checks
and balances vital to a sound subsidy system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Windfall Profits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended and HUD concurs that mortgage insurance should be limited to the purchase price of a mortgage or
the unpaid principal balance, whichever is lower. In addition, HUD would not permit resale of mortgages for capital
gains, even if the gains are passed through to HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Servicing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that ``[w]hen an HFA requests it, HUD should turn over servicing functions to it upon its purchase
of the loan.'' HUD intends to turn over mortgage servicing functions upon the sale of a loan in every case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Delinquent Loans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended splitting mortgages into financially viable and inviable portions, with HUD retaining the inviable
portion. HUD does not wish to use this method for restoring a mortgage to financial soundness, because it is inconsistent
with the overall objective of reducing the HUD-held inventory and HUD servicing responsibility. In addition, strategies
that involve owner consent, such as creating new mortgage documents, may add a party to the negotiations and complicate
the transaction. HUD would consider other approaches that meet mutual goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Long-Term Affordability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that HUD extend the mortgage insurance period when purchasers negotiate an extension of the affordability
period, so the insurance would be coterminous with the financing. HUD would need more information on what is being
proposed in order to assess this recommendation, e.g. what ``financing'' is being proposed? FHA insurance runs with
the mortgage; any additional insurance period would require careful consideration and review.

Refinancing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that HUD permit HFAs to restructure high-interest rate loans through Section 223(a)(7) refinancing.
HUD-held mortgages are not eligible for Section 223(a)(7) refinancing, and subsidized mortgages generally are
not eligible for prepayment. However, as part of the restructuring of the mortgage, HUD will consider modifying mortgages
to lower above-market interest rates (and to reduce subsidy payments, as appropriate) prior to mortgage sale. Such
reduction would be considered in any pricing.

Due Diligence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that HUD work with HFAs to disseminate information on mortgages and permit HFAs to perform adequate
and timely due diligence. HUD intends to cooperate fully with HFAs in their conduct of needed due diligence on the mortgages
in which they are interested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Warranties and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended that, among other representations, HUD warrant and represent that purchased loans are secured
by projects that are in full compliance with their regulatory agreements and subsidy contracts and that the loans
are current in their debt service and escrow and reserve payments. HUD's view is that not all of these representations
and warranties may be appropriate for the subperforming mortgages that are the focus of this negotiated sale program.
HUD proposes to discuss these representations in conjunction with necessary due diligence and a specific portfolio
of mortgages identified for sale.

Interstate Mortgage Pools
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCSHA recommended consideration of the formation of interstate mortgage pools, to lower administrative burdens
and transaction costs. HUD will consider such pools as long as the results are consistent with the overall objectives
of the negotiated sale program, including hands-on servicing by the purchasing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, NCSHA and IHDA recommended that HUD negotiate the sale of both unsubsidized mortgages with Section 8
contracts and nonperforming unsubsidized mortgages. As noted above, HUD intends to sell partially assisted, unsubsidized
mortgages in specialized auctions to investors that will be selected in part on the basis of their commitment to preserving
the economically integrated nature of this rental housing. In addition, HUD intends to sell nonperforming unsubsidized
mortgages to the highest bidder in competitive auctions that are designed to put local and national bidders on equal
footing. Given the high degree of investor interest in HUD's unsubsidized mortgage portfolio and the Department's
aim of reducing losses to the FHA insurance fund, the Department cannot justify reserving unsubsidized mortgages
for purchase only by State and local agencies. Depending upon the terms of a sale, however, these agencies may participate
with other investors in the purchase of these mortgages.

HUD Mortgage Sale Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments focused upon the mechanics of HUD's auction program. Both JBS &amp; Associates, Inc., a national
real estate and loan marketing firm, and Ross-Dove Company, Inc., an auctioneering firm, recommended that HUD use
open outcry auctions as one method of disposition to sell multifamily mortgages. HUD will consider the use of open
outcry auctions for some of its mortgage sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Real Estate Capital Recovery Association (RECRA), a trade association representing both real estate workout
specialists and real estate purchasers, recommended that HUD develop a strategy and schedule for disposing of the
HUD-held inventory; determine the best disposition strategy for mortgages on a case-by-case basis; and make greater
use of the private sector in managing, foreclosing, and selling assets. In addition, RECRA recommended against giving
mortgagors two purchase opportunities_i.e., the opportunity to payoff their mortgages and to bid in an auction.
RECRA believed both: (1) that HUD's ability to negotiate a payoff would be improved if the mortgagor could not participate
in the auction; and (2) that other bidders would not want to bid against the mortgagor who is most knowledgeable about
the property. The terms and conditions under which a mortgagor may be permitted to bid on its mortgage are best decided
in the light of the particular facts of a mortgage sale, such as whether the mortgages are being sold separately or in
pools or are current or delinquent. Accordingly, HUD will announce any such terms and conditions in the mortgage sales
announcement and by notice to affected mortgagors. HUD will consider these comments and other factors in setting
these terms and conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Leased Housing Association (NLHA) supported the proposed rule, but believed that it should have gone
further in spelling out the details of HUD's mortgage sale program, in order to provide an opportunity for public comment.
In particular, NLHA wanted more detail regarding the FHA mortgage insurance programs to be used, the minimum bid requirements,
any borrower right of first refusal and right to bid policies, and the nature of the bid process. It recommended that
mortgages be sold individually, bidders have adequate time in which to perform due diligence, and workout agreements
be permitted to be terminated by agreement between the new mortgagee and the mortgagor. All of this advice is well-taken.
The Department has consulted widely, and will continue to consult, in the development of its mortgage sales program,
but does not believe that such details concerning mortgage sale procedures should be codified in regulation. Instead,
the Department intends to adopt mortgage sale policies that are consistent with these regulations and are suited
to the characteristics of the mortgages offered for sale. This approach also will allow the Department to learn from
experience and feedback from all affected parties as it pursues a series of mortgage sales. Auction procedures will
be spelled out in a bid package distributed prior to each auction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One mortgagor recommended a carefully considered set of policies for mortgage settlements with owners. These recommendations
will be considered as HUD works with its financial advisor to develop a mortgage settlement policy. A law firm urged
special attention to participation by small investors in the mortgage sale program, including negotiated sales
to small investors. HUD seeks to encourage participation by small investors by offering nonperforming mortgages
in small pools; however, it is not authorized to negotiated sales to private entities. A development and property
management firm recommended against the sale of HUD-held mortgages on the ground that they would be too deeply discounted;
however, if they were sold, the firm recommended that the mortgages be sold individually, rather than in pools, to
receive the highest price. HUD will determine whether to offer mortgages individually, in pools, or both, based on
the characteristics of the mortgages offered for sale and other terms and conditions of the auction. The Chinese-American
Golden Age Association recommended the sale of Section 202 loans. HUD is considering various options for these mortgages
at the present time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the provisions in the final rule have been reformatted, to aid in clarity. Substantive changes made to the proposed
rule are identified below:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 207.270 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new provision has been added to part 207 which authorizes the Department to modify the terms of the mortgage reinsurance
pursuant to section 223(c) of the National Housing Act when the Department sells a mortgage with FHA insurance. This
change is necessary to take into account the fact that mortgages may be sold to investors at a discount rate due to fluctuating
interest rates. When mortgages are sold at a discount rate, HUD will adjust the amount of the reinsurance to reflect
the purchase price of the mortgage, not the original mortgage amount. HUD will determine the amount of the reinsurance
at the time of the mortgage sale. This regulatory change codifies existing Departmental policy for mortgage sales.

The definition of subsidized mortgage has been clarified to indicate that purchase money mortgages (PMMs) for previously
subsidized projects will be treated like subsidized mortgages. The definition of subsidized project has been conformed
with the Multifamily Property Disposition Act.

Section 290.200
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Language has been added to the section describing the purpose of the new subpart D, Sale of HUD-held mortgages, to state
that, except for negotiated sales to State and local governments, HUD will sell mortgages on a competitive basis.
Language has also been added to explain that the Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying mortgage
for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered mortgage from sale. The procedures set out in the remaining sections
of this subpart apply only when the Secretary has determined that a qualifying mortgage is to be sold.

The Department agrees with commenters that existing tenant protections should be preserved. Consequently, a paragraph
has been added to include language from section 203(k)(1) of the HCD Amendments of 1978, prohibiting the Secretary
from selling a HUD-held mortgage on a subsidized project unless the sale is made part of a transaction that meets certain
qualifications. The transaction must ensure that the project will continue to operate at least until the maturity
date of the loan or mortgage in a manner that will provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing
and future tenants as the terms required by the program under which the original mortgage was insured.

under the Order. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to HUD administrative procedures, and
do not impinge upon the relationship between Federal government and State and local governments.

or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish section 207.270 of this rule for effect without first soliciting
public comment, in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the Department is merely codifying an existing
earlier policy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of this subpart is to set out HUD's policy regarding the sale of subsidized and unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages.
Except as otherwise provided in &sect;290.201(b)(ii), the Department will sell mortgages on a competitive basis.
The Secretary retains full discretion to offer any qualifying mortgage for sale and to withhold or withdraw any offered
mortgage from sale. However, when a qualifying mortgage is offered for sale, the procedures set out in this part will
govern the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability of Civil Rights Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nothing in this subpart relieves HUD or housing that receives federal financial assistance from federal civil rights
requirements, including section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VIII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11063, and related regulations
and requirements. This includes housing in which less than 50% of the units are receiving housing assistance payments
under either Section 23 or Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and housing in which the rent of any unit
is paid by a Section 8 certificate or voucher.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenant protections preserved.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD will only sell subsidized mortgages if the sale is part of a transaction that will ensure that the project subject
to the mortgage will continue to operate, at least until the maturity date of the mortgage, in a manner that will provide
rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program
under which the mortgage was insured prior to its assignment. HUD's policy for selling subsidized HUD-held mortgages
is set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current mortgages.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD may sell current mortgages, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be sold either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) On a competitive basis to FHA-approved mortgagees; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) On a negotiated basis, to State or local governments, or to a group of investors that includes an agency of a State
or local government, if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government, or an agency of the State or local government,
to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Ensure that the project will maintain occupancy by the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized
housing program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government while
maintaining occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be sold if HUD can offer protections equivalent to those listed for an insured sale in paragraph (b)(1) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delinquent mortgages.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Delinquent mortgages will be sold only if, as part of the sales transaction: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The mortgages are restructured; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Either FHA mortgage insurance or equivalent protections are provided.

Sale of unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's policy for selling unsubsidized HUD-held mortgages is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current mortgages
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be sold with or without FHA mortgage insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delinquent mortgages
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be sold without FHA mortgage insurance. However, delinquent mortgages will not be sold if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) HUD believes that foreclosure is unavoidable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The project securing the mortgage is occupied by very low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA is extending the compliance dates for classification, hazard communication, and packaging requirements of
the Hazardous Materials Regulations applicable to infectious substances, including regulated medical waste.
The extension is intended to provide RSPA with time to evaluate the need for changes to regulatory requirements which
had been scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1994, and to continue coordination with other Federal agencies that
have jurisdiction over infectious substances. The extension is responsive to the concerns of shippers and transporters
that more interagency coordination is needed in order to avoid overlapping or inconsistent Federal requirements
for infectious substances.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 21, 1990, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;181 (55 FR 52402) that comprehensively revised
the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180) with respect to classification, hazard communication,
and packaging requirements of hazardous materials. In Docket HM&hyph;181, RSPA adopted standards based on United
Nations (UN) recommendations, including replacing the term ``etiologic agent'' with the term ``infectious substance''
and expanding the definition to include additional agents having the potential to cause severe, disabling, or fatal
disease. On January 3, 1991, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142A (56 FR 197), removing the previous
exception from regulation for cultures and stocks of etiologic agents (infectious substances) of 50 milliliters
or less total quantity in one outside package (the ``50 milliliter exception''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 20, 1991, in response to a large number of petitions for reconsideration, RSPA published a final rule making
editorial and substantive revisions to the December 1990 final rule (56 FR 66124). In response to one petition for
reconsideration, RSPA identified a subcategory of Division 6.2 (infectious substances) materials described as
``regulated medical waste'' (RMW), and provided packaging requirements for RMW which were less rigorous than those
for other infectious substances. Following issuance of the December 1991 rule, RSPA received additional petitions
for reconsideration and numerous comments and requests for clarification concerning provisions applicable to
infectious substances and RMW. Petitioners were concerned that RSPA had not adequately considered the costs and
other ramifications of adopting requirements for RMW. Commenters were concerned over potential overlaps or inconsistencies
with other Federal agencies that regulate infectious substances. In partial response to the petitions, RSPA extended
the compliance date for infectious substances from October 1, 1992, to April 1, 1993 (October 1, 1992; 57 FR 45442).
This extension and others which followed (March 3, 1993; 58 FR 12182 and December 20, 1993; 58 FR 66302) also applied
to the 50 milliliter exception which was removed under Docket HM&hyph;142A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 3, 1993, RSPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) and announced a public hearing under
Docket HM&hyph;181G (58 FR 12207) concerning the need for additional regulatory changes pertaining to infectious
substances. In order to provide time to evaluate the oral and written comments received in response to the ANPRM, RSPA
also extended the compliance date (58 FR 12182) for provisions applicable to infectious substances from April 1,
1993, to January 1, 1994. The ANPRM addressed a number of complex issues, pertaining to scope of regulation, consistency
with regulations of other agencies, the need for revised standards for non-bulk and bulk packagings, and defining
criteria for infectious substances and RMW. Following issuance of the ANPRM, RSPA continued its efforts to gain information
on other Federal agencies' regulatory requirements, and hosted and participated in a number of interagency meetings
on this issue. Federal agencies that regulate infectious substances include the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration of the Department of Labor, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration
of the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Postal Service and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service of the Department of Agriculture. On December 20, 1993 (58 FR 66302), RSPA again extended the compliance date
for provisions applicable to infectious substances from January 1, 1994, to October 1, 1994, to provide additional
time for resolving the issues of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA intends to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the near future. The NPRM will address those issues
concerning infectious substances and RMW that must be addressed in the near term to ensure the safe transportation
of these materials. The NPRM also will outline RSPA's intent to make a longer-term effort to harmonize requirements
of the HMR with international regulations and with the regulations of the other Federal agencies, and identify and
address gaps in regulation that may adversely impact transportation safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the merits of comments and petitions, RSPA believes there may be undue adverse impacts if regulatory provisions
for infectious substances go into effect on October 1, 1994 without change. Therefore, in this document, RSPA is revising
49 CFR 171.14(b) to extend the compliance dates. For regulatory requirements for RMW and for materials infectious
to animals only, the compliance date is extended from October 1, 1994, to October 1, 1995. This time period should be
adequate for RSPA to publish the NPRM, evaluate comments received in response to the NPRM, and make any necessary changes
to the HMR based on the merits of those comments. Without an extension of this compliance date, shippers and transporters
of these materials would have to comply with regulations that are likely to be changed in the near future and, thereby,
incur unnecessary costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other infectious substances, i.e., for cultures and stocks of substances infectious to humans, the compliance
date is extended from October 1, 1994, to January 1, 1995. The requirements for these materials generally were not
at issue in comments or petitions to the December 1991 final rule. The principal impacts of the January 1, 1995 compliance
date will be a nomenclature change from the old ``etiologic agent'' hazard class to the new ``Division 6.2'' classification,
elimination of the 50 milliliter exception for cultures and stocks, and expansion of the definition of infectious
substances to cover substances, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Lyme disease, which are not listed
in the CDC regulations (42 CFR 72.3). The removal of the 50 milliliter exception and expansion of the definition of
infectious substances originally were to have occurred on February 19, 1991 (Docket HM&hyph;142A; January 3, 1991;
56 FR 197). RSPA believes it is necessary to implement these requirements as quickly as possible to ensure public safety
and end confusion as to the status of materials that were not regulated prior to 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the transition periods provided in &sect;171.14, a person may comply with either the applicable ``old'' requirements
of the HMR (i.e., those which were in effect on September 30, 1991), or the current requirements adopted under HM&hyph;181.
If a material is an etiologic agent under the old regulations and does not meet any of the old exceptions, it must conform
to either the old requirements (i.e., must be described, labeled and packaged as an ``etiologic agent'') or the current
requirements of the HMR for ``infectious substances.'' (Note that Section 171.14(c)(3) provides for limited intermixing
of old and new requirements).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA is issuing this extension of the compliance dates without prior notice and comments because we view this as a noncontroversial
and necessary amendment and do not anticipate any adverse comments. However, if RSPA receives comments by September
30, 1994, that illustrate that an extension of the compliance dates is not in the public interest, RSPA will remove
this final rule and propose another date. If no such comments are received, RSPA will publish a document in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Although
the underlying rule was significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation
(44 FR 11034), this action is not significant because it does not impose additional requirements and has the effect
of extending compliance dates. A regulatory evaluation for the December 20, 1991 final rule is available for review
in the docket.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
(``Federalism''). Federal law expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements applicable to the
transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not substantively the same as Federal requirements.
49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These subjects are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous material; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous material and requirements
respecting the number, contents, and placement of those documents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
material; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
package or container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule concerns classification, packaging, labeling, and marking of hazardous material. Therefore, this
final rule preempts State, local, or Indian tribe requirements that are not substantively the same as Federal requirements
on these subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 5125(b)(2) of title 49 U.S.C. provides that when DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects,
after November 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date
of issuance of the final rule and no later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective
date of Federal preemption of this final rule will be April 3, 1995. Because RSPA lacks discretion in this area, preparation
of a federalism assessment is not warranted.

 We are proposing to amend the regulations regarding the importation of horses from Mexico to remove the requirement
that such horses be quarantined for not less than 7 days in vector-proof quarantine facilities before being imported
into the United States. We believe this action is warranted because Mexico has reported no cases of Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE) in over a year, and it appears that horses imported from Mexico without a 7-day quarantine
would not pose a risk of transmitting VEE to horses in the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 92, referred to below as the regulations, govern the importation into the United States
of specified animals and animal products, including horses from Mexico, to prevent the introduction into the United
States of various animal diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 27, 1993, we published an interim rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 45236&hyph;45238, Docket No. 93&hyph;096&hyph;1) in which we required that horses imported into the United
States from Mexico be quarantined for not less than 7 days in a vector-free facility. Prior to our interim rule, horses
intended for importation from Mexico were not required to be held in quarantine for any specified number of days, but
were required, instead, to be quarantined only long enough to complete the testing required by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 7-day quarantine became necessary when the government of Mexico reported that Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis
(VEE) had been detected in horses in that country. VEE is an equine viral disease, transmitted primarily by mosquitoes
and other hematophagous (blood-feeding) insects, particularly flying insects, that results in a high mortality
rate in animals infected with the disease. Although tests exist for the presence of VEE in horses, the tests currently
available may yield positive results for horses that have been vaccinated for VEE but that are not otherwise affected
with the disease. The most efficient method for initial identification of horses that may be infected with VEE is observation
of the horses for clinical signs of the disease. A horse will usually exhibit signs of VEE within 2&hyph;5 days after
contracting the disease. Seven days is considered the length of time necessary to ensure that any clinical signs of
VEE manifest themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this document, we are proposing to remove the requirement that horses from Mexico be quarantined for not less than
7 days. We believe the removal of this requirement is warranted because Mexico appears to be free of VEE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last case of VEE in Mexico was reported in July 1993. Following the initial outbreak of VEE in the Mexican State of
Chiapas in June 1993, the Government of Mexico instituted emergency measures to locate, contain, and eradicate the
disease. These emergency measures included the following: Activation of the country's animal health emergency
group; organization of groups such as regional livestock associations and State authorities; establishment of
quarantines in areas in which the disease was known to exist; vaccination of horses in affected areas; traceback of
horses that might have been moved from affected areas before quarantine measures were established; and increased
surveillance in States surrounding the affected areas. Based on these considerations, the government of Mexico
has requested that the U.S. Department of Agriculture consider Mexico to be free of VEE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the documentation submitted by the government of Mexico, it appears that no horses in that country are affected
with VEE. (This documentation is available, upon written request, from the person listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Therefore, we are proposing to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;92.324 of the regulations to remove the requirement that horses intended for importation from Mexico be quarantined
for not less than 7 days before being imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to remove the requirement in &sect;92.324 that horses from Mexico intended for importation
into the United States through land border ports be quarantined in Mexico at a facility approved by the Administrator
of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and constructed so as to prevent the entry of mosquitoes
and other hematophagous insects. This requirement was necessary when VEE was known to exist in horses in Mexico, but
we believe it is unnecessary now that Mexico appears to be free of VEE.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we have prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
regarding the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. We do not currently have all the data necessary for a comprehensive
analysis of the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning potential
impacts. In particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may incur benefits
or costs from implementation of this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 111, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations to prevent
the introduction or dissemination of any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease of animals from a foreign
country into the United States. In accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 U.S.C. 102, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to quarantine livestock imported into the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would remove the requirement that horses imported from Mexico be quarantined for 7 days at vector-proof
quarantine facilities. We believe this action is warranted because it appears that Mexico is free of Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE), and that horses imported from Mexico without a 7-day quarantine would not pose a risk of
transmitting VEE to horses in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compared with the 5-month period from October 1992 through February 1993 (pre-interim rule), there was a significant
decline in the number of horses imported from Mexico during the period from October 1993 through February 1994 (following
publication of the interim rule). During the 1992/1993 5-month period, there were 3,772 horses imported from Mexico,
compared with only 125 during the 1993/1994 5-month period. It is reasonable to assume that the additional costs associated
with the quarantine were at least partially responsible for the reduction in the number of horses imported during
the 1993/1994 period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a $50 hourly fee for inspection services conducted in Mexico by APHIS veterinary medical officers (in addition
to an APHIS per horse charge of $28.50). Assuming that APHIS services would be rendered for 2 hours during each day of
quarantine, and assuming an average quarantine period of 3 days prior to the VEE interim rule and 7 days following the
interim rule, the reduction in user fee costs from the lifting of the restrictions due to VEE would be about $400 per
shipment ($700 minus $300). For an average shipment of 40 horses, the savings in fees would be about $10 per head.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other quarantine costs, such as for feed and handling, could also be expected to decrease by more than one-half if the
7-day quarantine is no longer required. Whereas quarantine costs prior to the interim rule averaged about $3 per head
per day, we estimate that during the period following the interim rule, these charges increased to between $5 and $10
per day, due to additional precautionary measures. Again assuming a 3-day pre-interim rule quarantine, the savings
in charges by removing the 7-day quarantine requirement would be between $26 and $61 per head ($35 minus $9, and $70
minus $9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the combined savings of reduced user fees and other quarantine charges, the removal of the VEE quarantine requirements
would reduce importers' costs by an estimated $36 to $71 per head. Based on the average 1992 price of $310 per head for
horses imported from Mexico, these reduced costs would represent a savings of between 11 and 23 percent of the value
of each horse.

The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is proposing to adopt a rule setting forth procedures applicable to administrative
claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. The rule is intended to inform potential claimants of the
circumstances under which the RTC will consider claims based upon acts or omissions of the receiver to be timely filed
and to clarify when suit may be filed on these claims. The rule will thus inform and remind potential claimants of the
deadlines applicable to claims and suits based upon acts or omissions of receivers. Comments received from the public
will be considered in determining the form of a final rule.

receiver, unless the claims process described in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) has first been complied with.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) reveals that the dual purpose behind requiring exhaustion of claims
before suit can be filed is: (1) To minimize costs to the receivership estate and to the legitimate claimants who share
in the distributions from the estate, and (2) to minimize the burden on federal courts by avoiding needless litigation.
H.R. Rep. No. 101&hyph;54(I), 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reprinted in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1989 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; ADMIN. NEWS 215. These purposes are fulfilled by requiring that, before suit can be filed,
the receivership claims process must be exhausted with respect to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as
receiver, since litigation and its accompanying burden on the receivership estate and the courts may be avoided if
the receiver is given an initial opportunity to allow meritorious claims outside of litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, both the literal terms of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(13)(D) and the purposes of the statute make it clear that no suit can
be maintained against the RTC as receiver based upon any act or omission of the RTC as receiver unless and until the claims
process has been pursued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of March 31, 1994, the RTC held over 533,000 assets, such as real estate, mortgages and deeds of trust, and commercial
and consumer loans. The RTC, as receiver, has entered into and will continue to enter into numerous contracts for the
sale of these assets. In addition, the RTC, as receiver, enters into many other contracts relating to its operations.
Further, many additional claims arise relating to the conduct of receivership affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the number of contracts that the RTC enters into as receiver and because the RTC, as receiver, acts in a wide
variety of ways, disputes necessarily arise between the RTC and other persons. In order to fulfill the purposes of
the claims process set forth in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d), the RTC is promulgating this proposed rule setting forth procedures
applicable to claims based upon acts or omissions of the RTC as receiver. (The proposed rule does not address claims
against the RTC in its corporate capacity.) When final, this rule will replace the Interim Statement of Policy Regarding
Procedures to be Used with Regard to Claims Based upon Acts or Omissions of the Receiver, 59 FR 10663 (March 7, 1994),
which will be superseded in its entirety.

or lease, and any claim alleging a violation of law by the receiver; provided, that Post-Receivership Claims shall
include only claims that were not in existence as of the date of the receiver's appointment and that rely for their existence
upon an act or omission of the RTC as receiver. A Post-Receivership Claim shall not include any claim in existence as
of the date of the appointment of the receiver, regardless of whether the claim was then contingent, unliquidated,
not matured or not known or discovered.

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any Post-Receivership Claim must be filed with the receiver within the time limits set forth in this section or the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a Post-Receivership Claim is based on a contract that is in writing, that was entered into with the RTC as receiver
or as conservator prior to [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FINAL RULE], and that contains any term or provision requiring
that the claim be filed with or presented to the institution or to the RTC as conservator or receiver within a certain
period of time or by a certain date, then the claim must be filed by the earliest of the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The date or time set forth in the contract;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 90th day after the RTC first publishes notice of its intention to terminate the receivership; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The date established by any applicable statute of limitations.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the receiver mails a notice to a claimant requiring that a Post-Receivership Claim with proof be filed by a certain
date, then the claim must be filed by the date set forth in the notice or by the date established by any applicable statute
of limitations, whichever occurs first (unless the claim is based upon a contract meeting the description set forth
in paragraph (b) of this section, in which case the time limits set forth in paragraph (b) apply). The date set forth
in the notice shall be not less than 90 days after the notice is mailed (and may be later than the date established pursuant
to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(3)(B)(i)).

(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In all cases other than those described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a Post-Receivership Claim must be
filed by the 90th day after the RTC first publishes notice of its intention to terminate the receivership or by the date
established by any applicable statute of limitations, whichever occurs first.

(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No extension to file claims subject to bar of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(3)(B)(i) or 1821(d)(5)(C). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section shall apply only to Post-Receivership Claims and shall not apply to and shall not be construed as extending
the period to file claims described in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(3)(B)(i) or 1821(d)(5)(C) for any other claim.

Applicability of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicable portions of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d) shall govern any Post-Receivership Claim that is filed with the receiver.
No suit upon any Post-Receivership Claim may be filed or maintained until the claims process has been exhausted. Any
suit filed must be filed in the courts and in accordance with the time limits specified in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(6) (or 1821(d)(8),
when appropriate). 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(6) requires, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that suit be filed in the district or territorial court of the United States for the district within which the depository
institution's principal place of business is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the earlier of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The end of the 180-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) provided in 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i)
for the receiver to consider the claim; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date of any notice of disallowance of such claim pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contractual provisions requiring forbearance from suit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a claim is based upon a written contract that was entered into the RTC as receiver prior to [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE
FINAL RULE] and that contains any term or provision requiring the claimant to forebear from filing suit for any period
of time less than 180 days after first presenting or filing a claim with the RTC or receiver, then the claimant may, but
need not, treat the failure of the RTC or receiver to allow or disallow the claim prior to the end of the contractual forbearance
period as a disallowance pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(A)(i) entitling the claimant to file suit within 60 days
after the end of the contractual forbearance period. If the claimant does not elect to treat the failure of the RTC or
receiver to allow or disallow the claim prior to the end of the contractual forbearance period as a disallowance, then,
in order to preserve its claim, the claimant must file suit in the appropriate federal court during the 60-day period
beginning on the earlier of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The end of the 180-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) beginning on the date the claim is
filed; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date of any actual notice of disallowance of such claim.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) definitional exclusion covers any compensatory instrument issued in an employment
context that can be redeemed or exercised solely for cash, provided that the instrument either: (1) Is awarded under
an employee benefit plan that satisfies certain conditions prescribed by Rule 16b&hyph;3;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or (2) can be redeemed or exercised only upon a fixed date or dates at least six months from the date of the award, or incident
to death, retirement, disability or termination of employment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Both prongs of this exclusion are based on the principle that removal of the insider-recipient's discretion with
respect to the timing of grant and/or realization of a cash-only instrument would minimize the opportunity for speculative
abuse that Section 16 was designed to prevent.

As proposed to be amended in the Proposing Release, the Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) exclusion would extend to all compensatory
cash-only instruments issued pursuant to an employer-employee relationship, even if the insider-recipient could
control or influence the timing of such an instrument's grant or payout. In soliciting public comment, the Commission
urged commenters to address whether
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

There [is] any basis for according disparate treatment, for reporting and/or short-swing profit purposes, to equity-based
securities depending on whether they are settled exclusively in cash or stock (or in either stock or cash), where both
types of derivative securities provide identical opportunities for profit predicated on the underlying stock price
movement [].

As reflected in the above-quoted request for comment, the Commission is interested in comments on whether the current
definitional exclusion for compensatory cash-only instruments codified in Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3) is appropriate.
The Commission is interested in determining whether, for example, stock appreciation rights (``SARs'') that have
a multi-year term and may be exercised at the volition of the insider-recipient may provide opportunities for speculative
profit that are identical, regardless of whether the SARs are payable exclusively in cash, stock, or some combination
of the two and, from the perspective of shareholders and analysts, have the same Section 16(a)

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, in addition to considering the proposals and alternatives addressed in the Proposing Release, the
Commission invites commenters to express their views on whether the current exclusions for cash-only instruments
set forth in Rules 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i) and (ii), respectively, are overly broad in light of the purposes of Section
16, and thus should be limited to a smaller class of such instruments. In responding to this question, commenters should
discuss whether any continued exclusion for cash-only compensatory instruments should be limited to those for which
the timing of settlement is not subject to the insider's volition. For example, should Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(i)
be rescinded, so the exemption would be available only if the instrument met the fixed-date conditions of Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3)(ii)?
If an exemption for cash-only instruments is appropriate, should it be made available only under the short-swing
profit recovery provision of Section 16(b),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than also providing an exemption from the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)? If a separate Section 16(a)
exclusion is retained for certain compensatory cash-only instruments, comment is sought on whether it should be
recast as an exemptive rule, rather than the current rule, which excludes these instruments from the definition of
``derivative securities'' and therefore from the class of ``equity securities'' covered by Section 16.

Were the Commission to eliminate the definitional exclusion for volitional compensatory cash-only instruments,
transactions involving these instruments would be reportable under Section 16(a) but still could qualify for Section
16(b) exemptive treatment. Specifically, Rule 16b&hyph;3 coverage would be available for these instruments if
all applicable conditions were satisfied, including non-transferability (if retained as a condition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), six-month holding period, shareholder approval, disinterested administration (or formula), and window-period
settlement. Comment is requested as to whether fewer or additional conditions should be imposed as a prerequisite
to Rule 16b&hyph;3 qualification of cash-only instruments. Or should a separate exemption from Section 16(b) be
created for the grant and/or settlement of these instruments? If so, what exemptive conditions would be necessary
and appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of Section 16(b)?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the authority of 2 U.S.C. 136, the Librarian of Congress is authorized to make rules and regulations for the government
of the Library. 18 U.S.C. 1017 contains criminal provisions on the misuse of official U.S. Government seals. Part
701 is revised to clarify the boundaries of when and how much credit or recognition the Library of Congress should appropriately
receive when its name, seal, or logo are used in conjunction with a commercial product. It outlines also the current
circumstances under which the use of both the name and seals of the Library may be granted and the procedures for doing
so. This part combines and revises the provisions set forth in parts 701.35 and 701.36 of 36 CFR Chapter VII. Part 701.36
of 36 CFR Chapter VII, Use of the Seal of the Library of Congress and the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board, will be
removed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The name ``Library of Congress,'' or any abbreviation thereof, shall be used officially to represent the Library
of Congress and its programs, projects, functions, activities, or elements thereof. The Library's name shall be
used only when it is in the interest of the Library. Any other use of the Library's name by any person or organization,
except as provided by this part, is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Library of Congress seal symbolizes the Library's authority and standing as an official agency of the U.S.
Government. As such, it shall be displayed only on official documents or publications of the Library. The seal of the
Library of Congress Trust Fund Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress.
Procedures governing the use of any other Library of Congress logo are set out in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Internal publications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each internal Library publication shall include a copy of an official Library logo in a position, format, and location
suitable to the particular media involved. The logo may be alone or in addition to an approved unit or activity logo,
but shall be no less prominent than any other logo used, except in the cases of the Copyright Office, the Congressional

reproductions of images from its collections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The size, location, and other attributes of the logo and credit line should be positioned in such a way that they
do not imply Library endorsement of the publication unless such endorsement is expressly intended by the Library,
as would be the case in copublication or coproduction activities. Use of the Library name or logo in any context suggesting
an explicit or implicit endorsement may be approved in only those instances where the Library has sufficient expertise
to pass judgment on the subject matter, where that expertise has been engaged or applied, and where the terms of the
collaborative undertaking are such that the Library has sufficient control over the publication to make changes
necessary to reflect Library expertise.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to take action on the state implementation plan (SIP) submitted
by the State of Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (State or IDEQ) for the purpose of bringing about the attainment
of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) in the Ada County/Boise area. The SIP was submitted by the State to
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Ada County/Boise,
Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, EPA proposes to grant full approval of the emissions inventory and PM&hyph;10 precursor exclusion elements
of the SIP because they are separable and independent elements. EPA proposes limited approval under sections 110(k)(3)
and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) of the control measures that have been submitted by the State to date. This limited
approval of the control measures is for the limited purpose of making them federally enforceable and thereby advancing
the Clean Air Act NAAQS-related air quality goals. At the same time, EPA is proposing to disapprove the control measures
as not satisfying the specific requirement under sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the CAA to submit a SIP revision
that includes provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) are implemented no later than
December 10, 1993 and to disapprove the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further
progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP because the State has not adopted and submitted to
EPA the mandatory wood smoke control ordinances for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ada County/Boise, Idaho area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (see 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.313). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of title I of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP
revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In today's rulemaking action
on the State of Idaho's moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to apply
its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Additional information
supporting EPA's action on this particular area is available for inspection at the address indicated above. EPA will
consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on today's proposal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment
under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November
15, 1991: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provisions to assure that RACM (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may
be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented
no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction
and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a) of the
Act). This permit program element, also known as the New Source Review (NSR) program, was submitted by the State of
Idaho on May 17, 1994. EPA notified Idaho in a June 10, 1994 letter to the Administrator of the IDEQ that the NSR program
submittal was complete. EPA is currently reviewing Idaho's NSR program submittal to determine if the program meets
the requirements of the CAA. EPA intends to take action on Idaho's NSR program in a separate document when EPA has completed
its review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit contingency
measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination
by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline
(see section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). Contingency measures for the
Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ. A findings letter, dated January
13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho which informed him that the State had failed to make the required PM&hyph;10
contingency measures submittal for Ada County/Boise. The State has until July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency
for Ada County/Boise, or it will face Federal highway or offset sanctions (see section 179 of the CAA and 58 FR 51270
(October 1, 1993)). EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area when this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In this action, as described below, EPA is proposing to grant full approval of the emission inventory element and exclusion
from the PM&hyph;10 precursor control requirements. These elements of the State's moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
SIP submittal for Ada County/Boise are separable and independent of the provisions that the State has not adequately
addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also as described below, EPA is proposing to grant a limited approval of the control measures that have been submitted
by the State as of this date. EPA may grant a limited approval of these control measures under section 110(k)(3) of the
Act, in light of EPA's authority under section 301(a) of the Act to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality
by strengthening the SIP. The proposed approval of these control measures is limited, however, in that EPA is not proposing
that these control measures satisfy the specific requirements of sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) to implement
RACM, including RACT, in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. EPA believes, however, that the control measures
adopted and submitted as of this date will achieve PM&hyph;10 emissions reductions in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment
area. Thus, EPA is proposing to approve these control measures for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and
making them federally enforceable (see e.g. sections 113 and 302(q) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, because the State has not yet adopted into the SIP and submitted to EPA certain control measures on which it
relies in the SIP to demonstrate timely attainment and continued maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the Ada County
Boise nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to disapprove the RACM (including RACT) element. In addition, because
the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the
Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP depend in part on the control measures which the State has not yet adopted and submitted
to EPA, EPA is also proposing to disapprove these elements. If this proposed disapproval becomes final, it will begin
the period for the imposition of discretionary sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act and the 18-month sanctions
clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act. If finalized, this disapproval will
also authorize EPA to issue a Federal implementation plan as provided in section 110(c)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, prior to EPA's final action on this proposal the State submits the additional control measures on which
it relies and, based on EPA's review, these additional control measures adequately address the outstanding deficiencies,
EPA will consider withdrawing this limited approval/disapproval and will instead propose full approval of the PM&hyph;10
plan for Ada County/Boise relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements which were due November 15,
1991. EPA invites public comment on its proposed action.

1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under
the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing.

Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of section 110(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) of the Act and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission.

The IDEQ initially held a public hearing on the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 air quality improvement plan on October
11, 1990, and received no public comments regarding the plan. However, following one 24-hour PM&hyph;10 exceedance
on January 7, 1991 and two near exceedances on January 4 and 6, 1991, EPA requested on March 22, 1991 that IDEQ modify
the PM&hyph;10 plan to better ensure healthful air in the future. IDEQ revised the PM&hyph;10 plan and the State of
Idaho subsequently held a public hearing on the modified Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 plan on November 4, 1991. Again,
IDEQ received no public comments. The modified PM&hyph;10 plan was then adopted by the State of Idaho on November 14,
1991, and the plan was submitted to EPA on November 15, 1991 as a proposed revision to the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal in accordance with the
completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. A letter dated April 27, 1992 was forwarded to the Administrator
of the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to
be taken in the review process.

2. Accurate Emissions Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory
should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area (see e.g.
section 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act). Because the submission of such inventories is necessary to an area's attainment
demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received
with the demonstration submission (see 57 FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The base year emission inventory (1987) developed for Ada County/Boise identified the major sources of PM&hyph;10
concentrations during 24-hour worst case winter periods as residential wood combustion (71%), fugitive road dust
(15%), industrial (7%) and other sources, including but not limited to, transportation, construction and open burning
(7%). Annual emissions for 1987 were fugitive road dust (51%), residential wood combustion (23%), building construction
(12%), transportation (6%), industrial (6%) and other sources (2%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive,
and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent
with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Full approval of this element is appropriate because it is separable and independent of the deficiency which prevents
full approval of the SIP, namely, the adoption and submission of all control measures on which the State relies in the
SIP. The emissions inventory is a separable component of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP because it represents
an assessment of PM&hyph;10 emissions in the area prior to the adoption of control measures and will not change as the
result of any additional control measures adopted. For further details, see the Technical Support Document (TSD)
corresponding with this action, which is available at the EPA address indicated above.

3. Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the Act). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In broad terms, the State should identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in
light of the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject available control
measures if the measures are technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. In addition,
RACM does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and RACM does not
require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment of the
NAAQS and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Idaho's SIP submittals for Ada County/Boise do not provide for implementation of control measures which assure timely
attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, nor, in the alternative, do they show that the adoption of available control measures
would be economically or technologically unreasonable. Therefore, the submittals do not meet the specific statutory
requirements to provide for the implementation of RACM (including RACT) in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas.

a. Residential Wood Burning Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State relies on control strategies designed to reduce wood smoke for timely attainment of the 24-hour and annual
PM&hyph;10 standards. The residential wood burning program has three main objectives: 1. Reduce wood burning during
critical periods; 2. Improve the performance and efficiency of wood heating equipment; and 3. Provide reasonable
alternatives to wood heat. The State's available control measures to be implemented in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment
area that address the main objectives include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Episodic Wood Burning Curtailment Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIP submittal discusses an episodic two-stage voluntary and mandatory wood burning curtailments in the Ada County/Boise
nonattainment area. The first stage is a voluntary burn ban when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels in the nonattainment area
are predicted to equal or exceed 100 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 prediction is made after an IDEQ meteorologist calculates lower atmospheric stability
and evaluates PM&hyph;10 equivalent sampler, nephelometer, upper air temperature sounding, snow cover, surface
temperature, delta temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, National Weather Service and occasionally commercial
weather service data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second stage is a mandatory curtailment program. In 1986, Boise adopted an ordinance imposing a mandatory burn
ban when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels actually attain or exceed 110 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, and stable meteorological conditions are expected to persist for the next 24 hours (see Boise City Code, Tit.
4, Ch. 6). This ordinance was amended in January 1993 to reduce the trigger point for mandatory burn bans from 110 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 to 100

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP states that Garden City also has a mandatory curtailment program, but no documentation of the Garden City program
was included in the initial SIP submittal. The SIP further states that the State would attempt to persuade other Ada
County jurisdictions to implement mandatory curtailment programs similar to the Boise program. To date, EPA has
informally received copies of mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinances (some are signed and others are unsigned)
for unincorporated Ada County and the cities of Eagle, Garden City and Meridian. These ordinances, however, have
not been adopted into the SIP and have not been formally submitted to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its SIP submittal, the State notes that a county-wide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mandatory wood smoke curtailment program is necessary to bring the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area into timely
attainment of the NAAQS because approximately 30% of the wood burning in the area occurs outside of areas covered by
mandatory wood burning restrictions. For this reason, the SIP submittal for Ada County/Boise cannot be considered
to satisfy the RACM requirement because the State has not adopted as part of the SIP and submitted to EPA those available
control measures necessary for expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or shown that all economically and
technologically feasible control measures have been implemented and timely attainment is impracticable). Specifically,
the State has not adopted and submitted mandatory burn ban ordinances for Garden City, Eagle, Meridian and unincorporated
Ada County. EPA urges the State to promptly adopt and submit to the EPA the necessary mandatory residential wood smoke
burning ban ordinances on which the State relies in its SIP submittal.

In a letter to the EPA, dated August 14, 1992, the State argued for the exclusion of the locality south of Amity Road and
west of Cloverdale Road (the Kuna area) from proposed mandatory burn bans because the area is located in a separate
stream drainage from the Boise River Valley, and thus does not significantly contribute smoke to the valley where
the PM&hyph;10 exceedances have been recorded. The State also noted that the emission inventory, modeling and visibility
observations indicate that the Kuna area air quality is markedly cleaner than the ambient air in the Boise River Valley,
which includes downtown Boise. EPA acknowledged in an August 27, 1992 letter to IDEQ, that the State had adequately
demonstrated that mandatory burn bans in the Kuna area were unnecessary to demonstrate attainment and EPA formally
proposes to make this determination in today's action.

Although the SIP submittal cannot be considered to satisfy the RACM requirement at this time, EPA is proposing limited
approval of the Boise wood smoke control ordinance, Boise City Code Tit. 4, Ch. 6, pursuant to sections 110(k)(3) and
301(a) of the Act in order to strengthen the SIP and make the ordinance federally enforceable. EPA believes that this
control measure will result in reductions in PM&hyph;10 emissions in the nonattainment area and thus advance the
Act's air quality-related protection goals.

(2) Wood Smoke Public Education/Awareness Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wood smoke public education/awareness program for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area plays a critical
role in achieving the aforementioned three main objectives of IDEQ's residential wood burning program. The wood
smoke public education/awareness program was first officially initiated in 1986, following the passage of Boise's
local wood burning ordinance. Brochures, television and radio public service announcements, newspaper advertisements,
outreach meetings at public schools, media interviews and press conferences are the main components of the integrated
awareness package. Various points have been focused on during the program's existence, including the nature of the
wood smoke problem, health impacts, meteorological factors (including tips asking citizens to refrain from burning
on clear, calm and/or cool days) and how to burn cleaner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IDEQ and the City of Boise are responsible for a majority of the continuing wood smoke public education/awareness
program. According to IDEQ, local surveys and building department statistics show reductions in the numbers of wood
stoves installed, reduction in the average volume of wood burned per household and widespread public cooperation
during poor air quality periods as the result of the wood smoke public education efforts. These surveys and statistics
are the basis for the 10% annual credit IDEQ is claiming for the wood smoke public education/awareness program during
1990 through the year 2000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that IDEQ has adequately demonstrated, through surveys and building department statistics, that the
well-established, extensive, wood smoke public education/awareness program for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area has achieved at least a 10 percent wood smoke emission reduction. Therefore, EPA proposes limited
approval of the wood smoke public education/awareness program described in the Ada County/Boise SIP as a SIP strengthening
measure and proposes to accept the 10 percent credit requested by the IDEQ.

(3) Wood Stove Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The City of Boise's 1986 wood burning ordinance initiated a requirement mandating all wood burning appliances sold
and installed within the city to be certified as meeting certain emission standards (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;9).
The ordinance is enforced by city and county building department inspectors. The initial certification program
was based on the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality standards. The current program is based on the national
wood burning device New Source Performance Standards developed by the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation and enforcement of the certification program resulted in the City of Boise accelerating the introduction
of certified stoves and the phase-out of old, high emission uncertified stoves. However, IDEQ does not take any credit
for the emission reductions that have resulted from the wood stove certification program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the SIP submittal, Meridian, Eagle, Garden City, unincorporated Ada County, Nampa and Emmett also require
that only certified wood stoves be sold and installed within their respective jurisdictions. However, no documentation
(i.e. ordinances) supporting this statement was included in the SIP submittal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the enforceability of the City of Boise wood stove certification program and its advancement of the PM&hyph;10
air quality goals, EPA is proposing limited approval of this program as a SIP strengthening measure.

(4) Wood Stove Change-Out Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An initial feature of the City of Boise's 1986 wood burning ordinance was the development of a financial incentive
program to replace uncertified wood stoves with certified stoves (see Boise City Code, Sec. 4&hyph;6&hyph;18).
Low or no interest loans were offered to individuals participating in the program. In order to receive a loan, the participant
was required to give the uncertified wood stove to the city building department for destruction. The loan program
began in September 1986 and ended in September 1988. Approximately $800,000 in loans were made, resulting in the replacement
of 494 uncertified wood stoves with cleaner heating devices. IDEQ does not take credit for reductions in the emissions,
even though 84 uncertified wood stoves were removed from the airshed after the area source emission inventory base
year (1987).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) also operated a wood stove change-out loan program, which ran from
May 1987 to May 1993. 186 uncertified wood stoves were changed-out with cleaner heating devices during that period,
with a majority of the replacements occurring during 1988&hyph;1993. Again, IDEQ did not take credit for these PM&hyph;10
emission reductions. Both the Boise and IDWR wood stove change-out loan programs strengthen the SIP and further assure
that these wood smoke sources will not contribute to a future PM&hyph;10 exceedance. Accordingly, EPA proposes limited
approval of the wood stove change-out loan program because it strengthens the SIP and enhances PM&hyph;10 air quality
protection for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area.

b. Other Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, RACM does not require controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and does
not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment and
the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;13544).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IDEQ has determined, through its analysis of the nonattainment area, that road dust contributed 15 percent of the
PM&hyph;10 concentration on the worst case day in base year 1987. IDEQ did not propose controls for road dust. Rather,
the State relies on wood smoke controls to demonstrate timely attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 standard, concluding
that the implementation of additional control measures for road dust would not expedite attainment. However, the
State's control strategy assumes the timely adoption and submittal of effective and enforceable mandatory wood
smoke curtailment ordinances for the remainder of the nonattainment area. While such mandatory wood smoke curtailment
ordinances, in conjunction with the other wood smoke controls described above, may demonstrate attainment of the
standard, all of these control measures have not in fact been submitted. Thus, RACM is not met because it has not been
demonstrated that the implementation of available control measures could not expedite attainment or that the implementation
of such measures is technologically or economically unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is EPA's view that RACM does not require the implementation of controls for prescribed silvicultural and agricultural
burning for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area because the area is not significantly impacted by those activities.
Similarly, EPA believes that RACT does not require the implementation of control technology for stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10 in the nonattainment area, because the area is primarily characterized by commercial, residential
and light industrial uses. There are currently no major stationary sources operating in the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area and large stationary sources do not contribute significantly to the PM&hyph;10 air quality problem
in Boise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, EPA is proposing to approve, under the authority of sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act and for the
limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making such control measures federally enforceable, the control measures
that have been submitted to date as part of the PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. These measures
include the voluntary episodic wood burning curtailment program for the entire nonattainment area, the mandatory
episodic wood burning curtailment program for the City of Boise, the wood smoke public education/awareness program,
the wood stove certification program and the wood stove change-out program. A final limited approval of these existing
control measures would not mean that EPA has approved these control measures as satisfying the specific Act requirement
for the State to implement RACM (including RACT) in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (see sections 172(c)(1)
and 189(a)(1)(C)). Rather, limited approval of these measures by EPA means only that these control requirements
become part of the applicable implementation plan and are federally enforceable by EPA (see, e.g., sections 302(q)
and 113 of the Act). EPA is concurrently proposing to disapprove the RACM (including RACT) element because the State
has not adopted and submitted to EPA all of the mandatory wood smoke control ordinances on which it relies in its SIP
submittal. A final disapproval of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP RACM (including RACT) element would start
the 18 month clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act and the two-year clock for
the promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing
that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see
section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling for moderate
area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, the State must show attainment by December 31, 1994
is impracticable. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the General Preamble, 57 FR 13539, EPA has developed a supplemental attainment demonstration policy
for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. This policy provides additional flexibility in meeting the PM&hyph;10
attainment demonstration requirements. An earlier April 2, 1991 memorandum titled, ``PM&hyph;10 Moderate Area
SIP Guidance: Final Staff Work Product'' contained ``Attachment 5'' describing the same policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IDEQ conducted an attainment demonstration based upon WYNDvalley, a non-guideline dispersion model that EPA recommended
be used in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. WYNDvalley is applicable in light and variable wind scenarios
in regions influenced by complex terrain. Cold temperatures and light winds with limited vertical mixing create
stagnant weather conditions in the Boise River Valley. All of the PM&hyph;10 exceedances observed in the Ada County/Boise
nonattainment area have occurred during stagnant wintertime conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attainment demonstration indicates that the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area will be in attainment of the
24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS during the entire period of 1993 to 2000, with the maximum predicted 24-hour concentration
of 147

 occurring in 1995. The demonstration also addresses the quantitative milestone requirement (discussed below)
by showing that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be maintained after December 31, 1994 by predicting a 24-hour worst case
day design concentration of 144

 for the year 2000. According to EPA's review, which corrected for the use of non-reference PM&hyph;10 data in 1986
and 1987 (i.e. Hi-Vol SA321A gravimetric PM&hyph;10 sampler), the Ada County/Boise area has never violated the annual
arithmetic mean PM&hyph;10 standard. The highest valid three-year annual average in the nonattainment area is 43

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control strategy used to achieve these design concentrations and demonstrate attainment of both the 24-hour
and annual PM&hyph;10 standards, however, relies on mandatory wood smoke control programs in Eagle, Garden City,
Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. As discussed above in the section titled ``Control Measures,'' the State
has not adopted these ordinances as part of the SIP and submitted them to EPA. Accordingly, EPA proposes to disapprove
the attainment demonstration. More detailed description of the attainment demonstration is contained in the TSD
accompanying this document.

5. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every three years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as
defined in section 171(1) of the Act, toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the CAA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first three-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the three-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan
revision containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991 for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas (see 57 FR 13539)). As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially
addressed. Thus, submittals to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas must demonstrate that two milestones will be achieved (1st milestone: November 15, 1991 through
November 15, 1994; 2nd milestone: November 15, 1994 through November 15, 1997). For areas that demonstrate timely
attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, the second milestone should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance
of the standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.''
However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation for an area as attainment
is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially
address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain
the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment.
However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that demonstrate attainment, the emissions reduction progress
made between the SIP submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date of December 31, 1994 (46 days
beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first quantitative milestone. The de minimis timing
differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations
(see 57 FR 13539). In implementing the quantitative milestone and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area,
EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to
ensure timely attainment and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment
of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP purports to demonstrate attainment by 1994 and maintenance through 2000, which would satisfy three milestones.
However, as discussed above, the maintenance demonstration and, therefore, the quantitative milestones directly
depend on mandatory wood smoke control programs in Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. As
discussed above in the section titled ``Control Measures,'' the State has not adopted these ordinances as part of
the SIP and submitted them to EPA. Accordingly, EPA proposes to disapprove the quantitative milestone requirement
(see General Preamble, 57 FR 13565 and July 9, 1992 EPA memorandum regarding ``Processing of State Implementation
Plan (SIP) Submittals'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance addressing
how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the emission inventory for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area did not reveal any major stationary
sources, including any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA is proposing to grant the exclusion
from control requirements authorized under section 189(e) for major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors.

All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by IDEQ and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIP's and SIP revisions were set forth in
a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,
et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement
of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific control measures that were submitted as part of the SIP are addressed above under the section headed ``Control
Measures.'' As also discussed in that section, although the State relies on mandatory wood smoke control ordinances
throughout the entire nonattainment area (except for the Kuna area) to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of
the standard, the State has adopted and submitted to EPA a mandatory wood smoke curtailment ordinance only for the
City of Boise. The necessary ordinances for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County, as well as
evidence that the wood smoke control programs for these areas are adequately funded, implemented, enforced and maintained,
have not been submitted at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed for enforceability the wood smoke ordinance for the City of Boise, which includes the mandatory curtailment
program and the wood stove certification program for Boise, and has determined that it meets all of the criteria included
in the September 23, 1987, Potter Memorandum. Exemptions from the mandatory burn bans are allowed only for the following
reasons and must be approved by the City Building Department: a. wood burning is the resident's sole source of heat;
b. curtailment would cause unreasonable economic hardship for low income households; or c. the wood burning device
being utilized is certified by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality or EPA as ``clean burning''. This is
consistent with the recommendations for woodburning curtailment programs provided in EPA's Guidance Document
for Residential Wood Combustion Emission Control Measures. The wood stove certification program does not contain
any exemptions. Compliance with wood burning curtailments and the certification program is mainly achieved by responding
to citizen complaints, but the City of Boise has limited personnel that independently monitor for noncompliance.
Enforcement of burn bans and the certification program follows three progressive steps: 1. written warning; 2. fine;
and 3. further legal action against the violator, if needed. IDEQ's submittals and the TSD contain further information
on the enforceability of the Boise wood smoke curtailment ordinance and the personnel and funding intended to support
effective implementation of this ordinance. In these respects, this control measure appears to be enforceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that, where the State has relied on a local or regional government, agency
or instrumentality for the implementation of any plan provision, the plan must provide necessary assurances that
the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision. The State's initial SIP
submittal did not address the requirement of section 110(a)(2)(E). However, in a recent submission from the State
addressing State responsibility for local control measures, such as the Boise wood smoke control ordinance, the
State indicated that it relies on its existing ability to issue an operating permit to any stationary source when the
Department determines that emission reductions from that source are necessary to attain or maintain a NAAQS (see
Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IDAPA) 16.01.01012.03.c (June 1993); IDAPA 16.01.01401.03 (May 1994)).
The submission includes a copy of an opinion from the Attorney General's office stating that such permits could be
issued to the owners of wood stoves and could include provisions directly implementing local mandatory wood smoke
curtailment ordinances in the event a local entity fails to implement or enforce its respective local ordinance.
This mechanism appears to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act for State responsibility for
local wood smoke control ordinances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is reserving judgment on the enforceability of the outstanding control measures (i.e. mandatory wood smoke curtailment
programs for Eagle, Garden City, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County) and the adequacy of the related enforcement
programs until EPA receives and reviews these measures.

8. Contingency Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIP's that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). These measures must
have been submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should
consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's core control strategy . These measures must take
effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make reasonable
further progress or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ.
A findings letter, dated January 13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho informing him that the State had failed
to make the required PM&hyph;10 contingency measures submittal for the Ada County/Boise SIP. The State has until
July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency for Ada County/Boise, or it will face Federal highway and/or offset sanctions
(see section 179 of the CAA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area when
this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected.

9. Transportation Conformity Protective Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176(c)(4) of the CAA and the regulations implementing that provision require that transportation plans,
programs, and projects which are funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act must conform with
State or Federal air quality implementation plans (see 58 FR 62188 (November 24, 1993)). According to 58 FR 62228,
&sect;51.448, areas which submitted a control strategy implementation plan before November 24, 1993 must be demonstrated
to conform according to transitional period criteria and procedures by November 25, 1994. Otherwise, their conformity
status will lapse, and no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. Under 40 CFR 51.448(a)(2),
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 if EPA disapproves a control strategy implementation plan revision submitted by the State and notifies the State,
the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), and the Department of Transportation (DOT), the conformity status
of the transportation plan and transportation improvement program (TIP) lapses 120 days after EPA's disapproval.
After that time, no new project-level conformity determinations may be made and no new transportation plan, TIP,
or project may be found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted and conformity
is demonstrated according to transitional period criteria and procedures. Note that these conformity consequences
of a disapproval of a control strategy are in addition to the discretionary sanctions, which may be imposed under section
110(m) of the Act at any time following a disapproval, and the mandatory sanctions, which must be imposed under section
179 of the Act beginning 18 months following a disapproval.

Although &sect;&sect;51.448(d) (2) and (3) by their terms apply to ``areas which submitted a control strategy implementation
plan before November 24, 1993,'' the effective date of the conformity rule, EPA intended that these provisions apply
only to plans on which final action had been taken prior to the effective date of the rule. EPA intended the provisions
of &sect;51.448(a) (2) and (3) to apply to all plans, regardless of the date of submission, on which final action was
not taken until after November 24, 1993. In other words, EPA intended that the conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP lapse 120 days or, in the case of a protective finding, one year after the later of the effective date of the
conformity rule (November 24, 1994) or the disapproval of the control strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 51.448(a)(3), however, allows EPA to extend the 120-day lapse period to one year from the date of disapproval
if EPA determines that the control strategy contained in the revision would have been considered approvable with
respect to requirements for emission reductions if all committed measures had been submitted in enforceable form
as required by section 110(a)(2)(A) of the Act. If EPA makes such a ``protective finding,'' the transportation conformity
plan and TIP will be valid for 12 months following the date of disapproval and the conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP will lapse 12 months following the date of disapproval unless within that time another control strategy
implementation plan revision is submitted to EPA and found to be complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, as proposed in this action, EPA disapproves the control strategy in the moderate area SIP for the Ada County/Boise
nonattainment area, under &sect;51.448(a)(2) the conformity status of the transportation plan and TIP would lapse
120 days after the effective date of the disapproval. EPA has evidence, however, that the wood smoke control ordinances
for the cities of Eagle, Garden City and Meridian, and unincorporated Ada County are enforceable as a matter of local
law, and believes that these control measures would have been considered approvable with respect to requirements
for emission reductions if each of these control measures had been submitted to EPA in enforceable form as required
by section 110(a)(2)(A). Therefore, EPA proposes that the 120-day lapse period be extended to one year under 40 CFR
51.448(a)(3). Accordingly, if EPA takes final action on this proposal, and the RACM (including RACT) requirement,
attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and RFP elements of the Ada County/Boise moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment SIP are disapproved, then the State of Idaho's transportation plan and TIP may be found to conform for
12 months past the effective date of the PM&hyph;10 SIP disapproval. The conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP would then lapse 12 months following the effective date of final action on this proposal unless within
that time another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted to EPA and found to be complete.

III. Implications of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve the emission inventory and, as described in the TSD, several submittals to address requirements
of section 110(a)(2) of the Act, including the: a. Monitoring network (CAA section 110(a)(2)(B)); b. consultation
and public notification/process (CAA section 110(a)(2)(J); c. provisions for revising the plan (CAA section 110(a)(2)(H));
and d. prohibiting sources from significantly impacting other states (CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)). EPA is also proposing
to grant the exclusion from precursor control requirements authorized under section 189(e) of the Act. EPA is proposing
limited approval of the control measures that have been submitted by the State as of this date under the authority of
sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making them federally
enforceable. EPA believes making these control measures federally enforceable will achieve PM&hyph;10 emissions
reductions in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area and, therefore, advances the NAAQS-related goals of the CAA.
EPA is proposing disapproval of these control measures as meeting the RACM (including RACT) requirement, because
the State has not adopted as part of the SIP and submitted to EPA those available control measures necessary for expeditious
attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (or shown that all economically and technologically feasible control measures
have been implemented and timely attainment is impracticable), specifically, mandatory burn ban ordinances for
Garden City, Eagle, Meridian and unincorporated Ada County. In addition, because the attainment demonstration
and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10
SIP depend in part on the control measures which the State has not yet adopted and submitted to EPA, EPA is also proposing
to disapprove these elements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final disapproval of these Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP elements will authorize the imposition of discretionary
sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act, and will institute the 18-month clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions
under section 179 of the Act and the two-year clock for the promulgation of a Federal Implementation Plan under section
110(c)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, the State submits the additional control measures on which it relies in its SIP submittal and, based on
EPA's review, these additional control measures adequately address the outstanding deficiencies, EPA will consider
withdrawing this limited approval/disapproval and instead proposing full approval of the PM&hyph;10 plan for Ada
County/Boise relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements which were due November 15, 1991.

IV. Request for Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

V. Administrative Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2224), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). EPA's disapproval of the State request under section
110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any
pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal
does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal
requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities because it does not impose any new Federal requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document announces that NHTSA is considering the proposal of a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric
passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The purpose of establishing the range
is to encourage the production of HEVs. An HEV which meets the range would qualify to have its fuel economy calculated
according to a special procedure that would facilitate the efforts of its manufacturer to comply with the corporate
average fuel economy standards. Comments are requested to assist the agency in developing the proposed range.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, has two essential purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) To encourage the development and widespread use of methanol, ethanol, natural gas, other gaseous fuels, and electricity
as transportation fuels by consumers; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To promote the production of alternatively fueled motor vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve those purposes, the AMFA provides that alternatively fueled motor vehicles that meet an appropriate minimum
driving range qualify for special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for purpose of their manufacturers'
compliance with the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of electricity in the list of alternative fuels covered by the AMFA necessitates that a minimum driving
range be established for dual fueled electric passenger automobiles for fuel economy credit purposes. The AMFA specifies
a minimum driving range of 200 miles for dual fueled passenger cars (other than dual fueled electric) when operating
on the alternative fuel, but allows the Secretary of Transportation to establish the minimum driving range for dual
fueled electric passenger cars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to seek public comments about HEVs that would aid the agency in developing a proposed driving
range. The AMFA and Energy Policy Act provisions, which are codified at 49 U.S.C. sections 32901(c) and 32905, require
the Secretary of Transportation to establish a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric vehicles. This minimum
range requirement applies to passenger automobiles only. It does not apply to dual fueled light trucks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In seeking to carry out its goals, the Act attempts to balance two competing objectives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Encouraging the production of alternatively fueled vehicles by offering CAFE standard compliance incentives;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Encouraging the purchase of alternatively fueled vehicles by consumers by providing the incentives to only those
vehicles whose range of operation is large enough to meet consumer needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The setting of a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric automobiles must balance the needs of the consumer
with the technical and economic considerations that are faced by the manufacturers. A low minimum driving range eligibility
criterion might encourage the production of dual fueled cars, but lead to dual fueled electric vehicles being designed
with such a low alternative fuel driving range that consumers do not buy them or, even if they buy them, infrequently
operate them on the alternative fuel. Conversely, an excessively stringent minimum driving range eligibility criterion
might discourage the production of dual fueled electric cars and unnecessarily compromise other vehicle attributes
and aspects of performance. Manufacturers would be discouraged by an overly-stringent minimum range because a vehicle
which does not meet the minimum driving range for its type is unlikely to be built since the manufacturer would not receive
any of the benefits or incentives provided by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the viewpoint of the consumer, the necessary driving range may be dictated by the convenience of a range that permits
a typical workweek travel distance, or a daily travel distance for a fleet car. Also, if the majority of consumers would
use a dual fueled electric vehicle in an urban area with more recharging stations or in a fleet application with a central
recharging station, a large driving range may be less critical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether the range is large or small, the agency will need a method of measuring the range of HEVs. NHTSA is considering
basing the dual fueled electric vehicle driving range on procedures established by a Society of Automobile Engineers
(SAE) committee. The SAE is currently developing procedures for chassis dynamometer measurements of range, electrical
energy consumption, fuel economy, and exhaust emissions of HEVs. In a brief overview, the SAE HEV Test Procedure Task
Force committee's actions will include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Classifying the vehicle by driving range and ability to complete the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) driving
cycle,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Testing the vehicle on the appropriate type of cycle,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Testing at other driver activated control settings, if appropriate, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Estimating annual fuel economy, emissions, and electric energy consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overview stated above is from SAE's first rough draft of the procedure for HEV testing, and it does not specify when
the final procedure will be published.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To aid the agency in relating the data on driving range for dual fueled electric vehicles to the unique characteristics
of dual fueled passenger automobiles, NHTSA is posing a number of questions in the following areas on the use of dual
fueled electric passenger automobiles, as well as any other relevant areas such as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Consumer acceptability,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Economic practicability,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Technology,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Environmental impact,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Safety,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Driveability, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Information on other factors is also welcome. The data provided in response to these questions will be considered
by NHTSA in developing a proposed minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger automobiles. The data
will also aid the agency in making preliminary judgments about such fundamental matters as the extent to which manufacturers
would seek to achieve the selected range in designing dual fueled electric passenger automobiles, the production
volumes or schedules for those vehicles, the cost and other implications of different ranges, and the likely consumer
acceptability of different driving ranges. For easy reference, the questions are numbered consecutively throughout
the document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In providing a comment on a particular matter or in responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested
to provide any relevant factual information to support their conclusions or opinions, including but not limited
to test data, statistical and cost data, and the source of such information. The agency is particularly interested
in quantitative evaluations of anticipated environmental impacts and energy conservation impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests information and comments on the following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How should minimum driving ranges for dual fuel electric passenger automobiles be determined? Is there any trend
toward increased or decreased driving ranges?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Can the vehicle operate solely on electricity or must the auxiliary power source be activated in order to follow
the EPA driving cycle? How would you compute driving range on electricity if the auxiliary power source is activated
during the driving cycle? What if the other power source is also alternative fueled?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Can the SAE procedure be adapted for use with the EPA urban and highway cycles for determining driving range? Why
or why not? Is there some other test procedure that will be suitable for dual fueled electric vehicle?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Would dual fueled electric vehicles be generally utilized by consumers residing in urban areas and by fleets where
it would be practical to provide for recharging at centralized facilities as opposed to consumers in rural areas?
Also, where would it be practical to recharge the battery?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. What driving range does the consumer expect from the passenger cars that he/she operates on electricity? Does the
range vary with the size or typical use of the car; e.g., a subcompact car as compared to a large station wagon, or a car
typically used for city commuting compared to one used primarily for urban and intercity driving? Does the expected
driving range vary with the economic or social profile of the car operator; e.g., are younger drivers satisfied with
smaller ranges or do high-income drivers demand greater driving ranges? Would the consumer be willing to accept a
lower driving range in a vehicle with the added flexibility of dual fuel capability or with more recharging points
and shorter waiting times? What is the minimum driving range acceptable to consumers?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Do vehicle manufacturers consider availability of fuel distribution or recharging points in establishing driving
ranges?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Describe any trade-off for the design of the vehicle with cost that would dictate an upper limit of driving range
for economic practicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Discuss reduction in vehicle driving range due to climate control energy demand. Discuss any new technology utilized
in vehicle design and in advanced heating and cooling approaches to mitigate range reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Describe how the weight/size of the battery pack will affect the driving range on dual fueled electric passenger
cars. What determines this result?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Does the specific driving range of dual fueled electric cars create any environmental impacts that could be mitigated
by choosing a different range or battery capacity? Please discuss the basis for your answer (e.g., (1) setting the
minimum driving range so high that manufacturers could meet it only with battery technologies that employ more harmful
chemicals, (2) setting the minimum driving range so high that manufacturers would be discouraged from trying to meet
it, or so low that consumers wouldn't buy it, thus delaying the development or use of these cleaner technologies, and
(3) setting the minimum driving range so low that the consumer would frequently be forced to use the more polluting
non-electric fuel.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. For longer driving range on electric power, please discuss any significant safety or fire problems for the occupants
of the dual fueled car or any object with which the car may collide. Is there an optimum battery capacity that would minimize
potential safety problems for the electrolyte spillage, shock or fire? Please explain your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Would the driveability (i.e., handling and performance) of a dual fueled electric car be penalized by a requirement
for a driving range comparable to that for typical gasoline-fueled cars? Can an optimum driving range standard for
dual fueled electric vehicles be established from driveability considerations? Please explain your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Is it likely that dual fueled electric passenger car applications may have decreased performance capabilities
when powered by electricity (e.g., predominately city driving, acceleration, top speed, and gradeability limit)
and consequently result in lower consumer expectations for driving range. Please discuss your answer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. How do style or appearance considerations affect the space for the batteries and, therefore, minimum driving
range? How will minimum driving range limit the storage space in the trunk of the vehicle?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. What other factors, if any, should the agency consider in establishing the driving ranges for dual fueled electric
passenger cars when operated on electricity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. What do you recommend as the minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger cars when operating on electricity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. What safety problems could arise if both battery acid and the second fuel spilled and mixed during an accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. What kinds of range extenders are manufacturers considering for use in dual fueled electric vehicles (e.g., flywheels,
hydraulic accumulators, small range heat engines, fuel cell systems, etc.)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 184 of the Clean Air Act, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission recommended that EPA require
all state members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM), EPA is proposing to find that reduction of new motor
vehicle emissions through OTC LEV or LEV-equivalent program is necessary to mitigate the effects of pollution transport
and to bring nonattainment areas in the OTR into attainment and to avoid interference with maintenance. EPA believes
an alternative federal low emission vehicle program can be developed that would achieve reductions equivalent to
or greater than the OTC LEV program. EPA also believes there could be significant additional benefits from such a program
and proposes in today's notice a process by which development of such a program could continue. The Agency intends
to work with stakeholders in this effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the absence of such a program, however, EPA is proposing under sections 184(c) and 110(k)(5) of the Act that the
OTC LEV program is necessary throughout the OTR and is consistent with the Act. EPA is thus proposing a SIP call under
section 110(k)(5) to require each state in the OTR to revise its SIP to include the OTC LEV program within one year. Today's
notice also proposes regulations determining ``model year'' for purposes of section 177 and part A of title II of the
Act as that term is applied to on-highway motor vehicles.

This proposal supplements EPA's April 26 proposal, and EPA does not intend to thereby withdraw from consideration
any of the various elements previously proposed. Rather, EPA intends to focus for purposes of public comment on EPA's
proposed specific approach to, and basis for, approving the OTC LEV recommendation. In addition, EPA is proposing
today ``model year'' regulations that are relevant to, but beyond the specific scope of EPA's April 26 proposal.

A. Overview of Title I Scheme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The OTC's recommendation under section 184(c) of the Act that EPA mandate that states in the OTR adopt the LEV program
arises in the context of the program designed to address ozone (or ``smog'') pollution in subpart 2 of part D of title
I of the Act. This program is described in detail in EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), and the Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble,
57 FR 55620 (Nov. 25, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of provisions in subpart 2 and elsewhere in the Act are particularly important to emphasize here. Part D establishes
a system for more polluted areas to have more time to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and
subjects those more polluted areas to a graduated program of additional and more stringent specific control requirements
to be accomplished over the longer timeframe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 181(a) provides for classification of ozone nonattainment areas based on the degree of the nonattainment
problem in the area (as measured by the area's ozone design value), and provides that attainment ``shall be as expeditiously
as practicable but not later than'' specified deadlines expressed as years after enactment. The areas and the corresponding
attainment deadlines are: Marginal (1993); moderate (1996); serious (1999); severe (2005 or 2007, depending on
the design value); and extreme (2010). The Act also provides for designation of areas as attainment or as ``unclassifiable.''
All classifications other than extreme are represented in the OTR. Section 184(b) also specifies additional requirements
applicable for attainment areas in ozone transport regions, including: (1) Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance
programs in cities meeting specified size thresholds; (2) state-wide implementation of reasonably available control
measures (RACT); (3) ``Stage II'' vehicle refueling vapor controls or ``comparable measures''; and (4) treatment
of major stationary sources of ozone precursors as if they were in moderate nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 establishes the graduated control measures applicable for each nonattainment classification. These
measures are additive in that the higher classifications must generally adopt, in addition to measures specifically
applicable to that higher classification, all measures identified for lower classifications as well. A basic requirement
applicable to marginal and above classifications is that states are to submit inventories of actual emissions from
all sources in each nonattainment area. See sections 182(a)(1) and 172(c)(3). These emissions inventories may be
important in determining whether the LEV program is necessary in the OTR. The inventories are critical inputs for
models used to determine the magnitude of emissions reductions that may be needed for attainment and the effectiveness
of various measures to obtain such reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another potentially key requirement is that moderate and above areas must submit attainment demonstrations. Under
section 182(b)(1)(A), for moderate and above areas, states are to specify in their plans specific annual reductions
in emissions ``as necessary to attain the [NAAQS] for ozone by the attainment date applicable under this Act.'' Under
section 182(c)(2)(A), for serious and above areas, states are to submit a demonstration that the SIP, ``as revised,
will provide for attainment of the ozone [NAAQS] by the applicable attainment date.'' Further, this provision continues,
``[t]his attainment demonstration must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined
by the Administrator, in the Administrator's discretion, to be at least as effective.'' The modeling information
is, of course, important to determining the reductions necessary in areas to achieve attainment throughout the OTR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also relevant that states are obligated to adopt various measures specified for progress toward attainment,
and to achieve certain percentage reductions in emissions by interim dates. In general, section 172(c)(2) requires
that SIPs ``require reasonable further progress'' (RFP), defined in section 171(1) to mean ``such annual incremental
reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by
the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the [NAAQS] by the applicable date.'' Section 182(b)
specifically provides that, by November 15, 1993, states were to submit SIP revisions for moderate and above areas
providing for, with a limited feasibility exception, a 15% reduction by 1996 in emissions of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from a 1990 baseline. Further, section 182(c)(2)(B) provides that, by November 15, 1994, states are to submit
SIP revisions for serious and above areas that will result, subject to a limited feasibility exception, in additional
reductions in VOC emissions from the 1990 baseline of 3% each year averaged over consecutive 3-year periods beginning
in 1996 and until the attainment date. Section 182(c)(2)(C) provides for substitution of reductions in emissions
of nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for VOC, in accordance with EPA guidance. These RFP requirements establish minimum reductions that certain nonattainment
areas in the OTR will be required to achieve apart from whether EPA approves or disapproves the OTC recommendation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 110 of the Act establishes general requirements for SIPs. Section 110(a)(2) specifies minimum
elements of a state's SIP, and subparagraph (D) specifies that a state's SIP shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contain adequate provisions_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any source or other type of emissions activity within
the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) Contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect
to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision, as discussed in detail below, is the key mechanism under the transport provisions of sections 176A
and 184, and is central to the OTC recommendation and to EPA's action on it.

B. Ozone Transport Region Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTR was established by operation of law under section 184 of the Act and is comprised of the States of Connecticut,
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont,
the District of Columbia, and the portion of Virginia that is within the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area
that includes the District of Columbia. Congress established the OTR in the 1990 Amendments to the Act based on the
recognition that the transport of ozone and ozone precursors throughout the region may render the northeast states'
attainment strategies interdependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 184, the Administrator established a Northeast Ozone Transport Commission for the OTR consisting
of the Governors of each state or their designees, the Administrator or her designee, the Regional Administrators
for the EPA regional offices affected (or the Administrator's designees), and an air pollution control official
representing each state in the region, appointed by the Governor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c) specifies a procedure for the OTC to develop recommendations for additional control measures to be
applied within all or a part of the OTR if the OTC determines that such measures are necessary to bring any area in the
OTR into attainment for ozone by the applicable dates in the Act. Section 184(c)(1) provides that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon petition of any States within a transport region for ozone, and based on a majority vote of the Governors on the
Commission (or their designees), the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for public comment, develop recommendations
for additional control measures to be applied within all or a part of such transport region if the commission determines
such measures are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart 2 of part
D of title I of the Clean Air Act].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184(c) also lays out procedures the Administrator is to follow in responding to recommendations from the
OTC. Upon receipt of the recommendations, the Administrator is to publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice stating that the recommendations are available and providing an opportunity for a public hearing within 90
days. The Administrator is also to ``commence a review of the recommendations to determine whether the control measures
in the recommendations are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by [subpart
2] and are otherwise consistent with [the] Act.'' Finally, in undertaking her review, the Administrator is to consult
with members of the OTC and is to take into account the data, views, and comments received pursuant to the public hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, sections 184(c)(4) and (5) govern EPA's response to the OTC recommendations. The Administrator is to determine
whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the recommendations within nine
months of receipt. For any disapproval, the Administrator is to specify: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Why any disapproved additional control measures are not necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment
by the dates provided by [subpart 2] or are otherwise not consistent with the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Recommendations concerning equal or more effective actions that could be taken by the commission to conform
the disapproved portion of the recommendations to the requirements of [section 184]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184(c)(5) provides that, upon approval or partial approval of any recommendations, the Administrator is
to issue to each state in the OTR to which an approved requirement applies a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the
SIP for that state is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), quoted above. Under section 184(c)(5),
the Administrator's finding of inadequacy under section 110(a)(2)(D) is to require that each affected state revise
its SIP to include the approved additional control measures within one year after the finding is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, section 184(d) provides that, for purposes of section 184, the Administrator is to ``promulgate criteria
for purposes of determining the contribution of sources in one area to concentrations of ozone'' in another nonattainment
area. These criteria are to ``require that the best available air quality monitoring and modeling techniques be used
for purposes of making such determinations.'' EPA issued such criteria in 1991.

C. Background Regarding OTC LEV Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator convened the OTC on May 7, 1991. Thereafter, the OTC moved to work toward a regional ozone strategy
with emphasis on consensus agreements to adopt regional measures to address the ozone problem in the Northeast. To
address the contribution of motor vehicles to the northeast ozone problem, the OTC focused early on emissions standards
for new motor vehicles and on adoption of federal reformulated gasoline throughout the OTR as potential additional
control measures. The Act, however, imposes certain limitations on the states' ability to adopt new motor vehicle
emissions standards.

Section 209 of the Act generally preempts states from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards, leaving
such regulation to EPA under section 202 of the Act. Section 209 does, however, provide an exception for California
to adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards where the Administrator grants a preemption waiver based on a finding
that California's standards will be, ``in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable
Federal standards.'' Further, under section 177 of the Act, any state which has SIP provisions approved under part
D of title I may adopt and enforce new motor vehicle emission standards for any model year if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) California and such state adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined
by regulations of the Administrator).*&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has granted a waiver for California's ``Low Emission Vehicle'' program. See 58 FR 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993)(announcing
availability of Waiver of Federal Preemption; California Low-Emission Vehicle Standards (Jan. 8, 1993)). This
program generally calls for five categories of vehicles meeting progressively more stringent emissions standards:
California Tier I vehicles; Transitional Low Emission Vehicles (TLEV); Low Emission Vehicles (LEV); Ultra-Low
Emission Vehicles (ULEV); and Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). California has also established an overall non-methane
organic gas (NMOG) standard that each manufacturer must meet for its fleet of new vehicles in a particular model year
by selling any combination of vehicles certified by California as meeting standards for one of the five categories.
In addition, under California's program, at least 2% of each manufacturers' new vehicle fleet sold in California
must be ZEV's by 1998 and 10% by 2003. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its second meeting on July 16, 1991, the OTC adopted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in which the state and District
of Columbia representatives agreed that, in view of the significant contribution of motor vehicles to the northeast
ozone problem, they all support California's Motor Vehicle Control Program, and call on their jurisdictions to cooperatively
evaluate the feasibility, air quality benefits, and associated costs of this Program in the OTR. At its third meeting
on October 29, 1991, the OTC states agreed to a further MOU providing that each OTC state would take steps to implement
California's Low Emission Vehicle program as soon as possible. New York and Massachusetts are the only states that
have adopted the California LEV program in legislation and regulations without contingencies, and both states are
set to implement their programs. The automobile manufacturers have challenged the legality of both programs, and
both lawsuits are ongoing. Other states have adopted or are adopting the program contingent on regional program adoption,
and the remaining states are at various stages of the legislative or regulatory process to adopt the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1993, Maine, Maryland, and Massachusetts petitioned the OTC to adopt a recommendation calling for the application
of the California LEV program throughout the OTR. During the fall of 1993, the OTC held a number of public forums in various
locations in the northeast, and held a public hearing in Hartford, Connecticut on December 16&hyph;17, 1993. Finally,
at its winter meeting on February 1, 1994, in Washington, D.C., the OTC voted by a 9 to 4 majority to recommend that EPA
mandate the California LEV program throughout the OTR. (The OTC refers to the program they recommend as ``OTC LEV.'')
New Hampshire, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey voted against the recommendation. The OTC's recommendation contains
the following elements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The OTC LEV program would be applicable to all 1999 and subsequent model year passenger cars and light-duty trucks
in the OTR;

(2) Subject to certain very limited exceptions, all vehicles sold, imported, delivered, purchased, leased, rented,

pursuant to a California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OTC LEV program would allow the sale of the five categories of California vehicles: California Tier I, TLEV,

Regarding California's ZEV sales mandate, the OTC recommends that, to the extent it must apply to satisfy section
177, it shall apply. But if it is not required under section 177, the OTC recommends that the ``individual states within
the OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or economic incentives designed to increase the sales of
ZEVs in the programs they adopt.''

D. EPA Actions in Response to the OTC LEV Recommendation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1994, EPA published a notice announcing receipt of the OTC's recommendation, as required by in section
184(c)(1). See 59 FR 12914. This notice explained EPA's process for responding to the recommendation, identified
the major elements of the recommendation, and briefly explained EPA's intended approach at that time for analyzing
the issues. On April 8, 1994, EPA announced that the public hearing as required by section 184(c)(1) would be held in
Hartford, Connecticut on May 2&hyph;3, 1994. See 59 FR 16811. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on the OTC recommendation. 59 FR at 21720. This
notice described the framework for EPA's action on the recommendation and provided substantial detail regarding
the issues EPA was considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove
the recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM described in detail the background and context of the OTC's recommendation, as well as the legislative history
of section 184. The text of the OTC's recommendation was reprinted as an appendix to the NPRM. It also addressed the
applicability of rulemaking procedures for EPA's action on the recommendation. Thereafter, the notice addressed
the standards applicable to EPA's review of the recommendation, including both the ``necessary'' and ``consistent
with the Act'' criteria. Regarding necessity, the NPRM addressed the legal interpretation of this standard, the
magnitude of emissions reductions needed for attainment in the OTR, the focus on contribution of emissions from across
the OTR, and the timing of the necessary reductions, including the relevance of maintenance after attainment. The
NPRM also explained the OTC's recommended LEV program in detail, EPA modeling of the emissions benefits from this
program, and the auto manufacturers' FLEV alternative. The NPRM then explained EPA's approach to considering other
alternatives to the OTC LEV program. Regarding consistency of the OTC LEV recommendation with the Act, EPA addressed
issues common to pending litigation in New York and Massachusetts as well as other issues regarding consistency of
the OTC LEV recommendation with section 177 of the Act. Overall, EPA proposed, in the alternative, to approve, disapprove,
or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's recommendation. The NPRM provided that the public comment
period would remain open until June 3, 1994, thirty days following the public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide a further opportunity for interactive discussion of the issues among the various interested parties,
members of the public, and EPA, the Agency held an additional series of three public ``roundtable'' meetings in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, Durham, New Hampshire, and New York City. The agenda for these meetings was structured to generally
follow the framework for analysis described in the NPRM. EPA published a notice on June 2, 1994, providing the time,
place, and agenda for each meeting. See 59 FR 28520. The primary topics discussed at the first meeting in Philadelphia
were the proper interpretation of the ``necessity'' standard, and the OTC LEV program itself. The topics addressed
at the second meeting in Durham included the magnitude of reductions needed in the OTR, alternatives to the OTC LEV
program, and a proposal from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) for emissions trading. At the third meeting in New
York City, the discussion continued regarding alternative approaches to achieving the necessary emissions reductions,
including the automakers' FLEV proposal, and a proposal from Texaco, Merck, and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas
Co. to establish a cap on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions together with trading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the New York City roundtable meeting, EPA re-opened the public comment period on the NPRM until July 30, 1994, to
allow interested parties to submit additional information in response to issues raised in the roundtable meetings.
See 59 FR 35292. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 4, 1994, EPA formally created a subcommittee of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee in accordance with the
Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. The subcommittee will focus on issues related to the OTC petition and
provide a public forum to pursue discussion of alternative car standards that could apply in 49 states. The first substantive
meeting of the subcommittee will take place in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, September 13 and Wednesday, September
14, 1994 at the Ramada Plaza Hotel. EPA published a notice of these meetings on August 30, 1994. See 59 FR 44729.

II. Explanation of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing today to approve the OTC's LEV recommendation based on the determination under sections 184(c) and
110(k) of the Act that the recommended LEV or a LEV-equivalent program
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 is necessary throughout the OTR and that the recommended LEV program is otherwise consistent with the Act. EPA is proposing
to find under its SIP call authority in section 110(k)(5)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 that the SIP for each state in the OTR is substantially inadequate to meet the requirements relating to pollution transport
in section 110(a)(2)(D).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is thus proposing to require each state in the OTR to revise its SIP to include the LEV program within one year after
the section 110(k)(5) finding is finally issued. EPA is proposing that the SIP call allow individual OTR states to
give manufacturers the choice of complying with either the OTC LEV requirements or_if such a program is developed_a
voluntary new-vehicle program to which automakers could voluntarily opt-in that achieves equivalent or greater
emissions reductions that are fully enforceable and qualifies for SIP credits.

Section 110(k)(5) authorizes the Administrator, whenever she finds that a SIP for an area is substantially inadequate
to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described in section 176A or 184, or to otherwise comply
with any requirement of the Act, to require the State to revise the SIP as ``necessary'' to correct the deficiency.

EPA does not ordinarily undertake rulemaking to issue a SIP call. EPA usually issues SIP calls by letter containing
a finding of substantial inadequacy. The basis for the SIP call and finding would then be the subject of notice-and-comment
rulemaking before the imposition of any sanctions warranted in response to state failure to respond to the SIP call.
Here, EPA is choosing instead to undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking regarding the basis of the SIP call before
issuing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also proposing that states in the OTR be allowed, but not required, to adopt the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales
requirement. The OTC recommended that EPA require states to adopt the ZEV sales requirement only if it is a necessary
component of a LEV program under section 177. EPA is proposing today that a ZEV sales requirement is not a required component
of a LEV program adopted under section 177 and that states would therefore not be obligated to adopt it. However, states
have the discretion to include a ZEV sales requirement. States may also include economic incentives designed to increase
the sales of ZEVs as long as such incentives are consistent with sections 177 and 209 of the Act. EPA is also taking comment
on whether to adopt a ``ZEV equivalency approach'' to require states either to impose ZEV mandates or to impose other
requirements on new motor vehicles that achieve the evaporative NMOG and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 benefits associated with ZEVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA is proposing regulations to determine the term ``model year'' for purposes of section 177 and part A of
title II of the Act, as that term applies to motor vehicles. The proposed regulations provide that model year will apply
on a model-by-model basis. This regulatory action codifies long-standing EPA guidance on this definition and should
clarify the applicability of the two-year lead-time requirement in section 177.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposed action is authorized by several Clean Air Act provisions. As discussed in the NPRM, EPA has authority
to approve the OTC's LEV recommendation under section 184(c). EPA also has independent authority to require that
states submit LEV SIP revisions under sections 110(a)(2)(D) and 110(k)(5). EPA disagrees with the comments of the
automakers that argue that EPA lacks authority to approve the OTC LEV recommendation because the section 184 process
is unconstitutional and because an EPA SIP call requiring state regulation of emissions from new motor vehicles violates
sections 177, 202, and 209 of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. EPA's Authority To Act Under Section 184
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 184 provides a clear statutory basis for EPA's action here. EPA described that provision in detail in the background
section above, and in its April 26 proposal. See 59 FR at 21722&hyph;24. In summary, the OTC is a body created by operation
of law under sections 176A and 184 of the Act, and is comprised of the Governor (or Governor's designee) and an air pollution
control official appointed by the Governor for each state in the OTR, as well as the EPA Administrator (or her designee)
and the affected EPA Regional Administrators (or the Administrator's designees). Decisions of the OTC are by majority
vote of all members other than the EPA representatives. Under section 184(c), the OTC may, after notice-and-comment,
develop recommendations for additional control measures to be applied within the OTR as necessary to bring any area
in the region into attainment by the dates provided in subpart 2 of part D. The OTC is then to transmit such recommendations
to EPA to require such measures throughout the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 184 grants EPA authority to approve the recommendations and issue SIP calls requiring that the affected states
adopt the recommended measures if EPA determines that the measures are ``necessary to bring any area in [the OTR] into
attainment by the dates provided by this subpart and are otherwise consistent with the Act.'' Upon approval, section
184(c)(5) authorizes the Administrator to issue a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the SIP for any state to which
a requirement of the approved recommendation applies is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)
of the Act. The effect of the finding is to require that any such state revise its SIP to include the approved recommended
measures within one year after the finding is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. State Obligations and EPA's Authority To Act Under Section 110
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also is proposing to interpret section 110 of the Act to provide that the Agency has independent authority for today's
proposed action under that section, apart from any authority provided by section 184. Under section 110(a)(2)(D),
each state is obligated to submit SIP provisions prohibiting sources in the state from contributing significantly
to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance in any other state. If EPA finds that a SIP is substantially inadequate
to adequately mitigate interstate pollution transport, section 110(k)(5) authorizes EPA to issue a SIP call to correct
the inadequacy. Under EPA's proposed interpretation, sections 110(a) and (k) allow EPA to find at any time that a SIP
is inadequate due to pollution transport. Thus, EPA is proposing to find that, because of the transport of pollution,
OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) is necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve or maintain the ozone NAAQS, and therefore,
that EPA has authority under sections 110(a)(2)(D) and (k)(5) to make a finding of substantial inadequacy and to issue
a SIP call requiring adoption of OTC LEV. Rather than make a general finding of SIP substantial inadequacy, EPA is proposing
to find the SIPs substantially inadequate only to the extent they do not contain the OTC LEV program. EPA is therefore
proposing to require these states to adopt the OTC LEV program to correct the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments broadened each state's long-standing obligation to address in its SIP the contribution
of emissions in its state to air pollution in other states.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The changes expand the provision beyond stationary sources that prevent downwind attainment or maintenance to other
sources and emissions activities that contribute significantly
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 to downwind nonattainment or interfere with downwind maintenance. The expanded provision encompasses, among other
things, mobile source controls in light of the impact of mobile sources on downwind attainment and maintenance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to 1990, section 110(a)(2)(E) required that the SIPs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contain adequate provisions *&blank;*&blank;* prohibiting any stationary source within the State from emitting
any air pollutant in amounts which will *&blank;*&blank;* prevent attainment or maintenance by any other state of
any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1990 Amendments, this provision was re-codified at section 110(a)(2)(D) and broadened to require that a SIP
submitted under the Act shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contain adequate provisions *&blank;*&blank;* prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any
source or other type of emissions activity within the state from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will *&blank;*&blank;*
contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with respect to
any such [NAAQS].

To some extent the reference to contribution merely codified an EPA approach taken under the old section 110(a)(2)(E)
and that at least one court decision had upheld. See Air Pollution Control District of Jefferson County, Kentucky

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever the Administrator finds that the applicable implementation plan for any area is substantially inadequate
to attain or maintain the relevant [NAAQS], to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described
in section [176A] or section [184], or to otherwise comply with any requirement of this Act, the Administrator shall
require the state to revise the plan as necessary to correct such inadequacies.

deadlines, not exceeding 18 months after notice, for submission of the plan revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Importantly, the Act does not address how states' attainment demonstrations are to account for transport of ozone
pollution and its precursors.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 As was the case prior to the 1990 Amendments, neither section 110 nor any other provision of the Act specifies when states
must submit SIP revisions to address the transport issue. Even with the advent of the very specific SIP submission
schedules in the subpart II ozone program under the 1990 Amendments, no deadline is specified for compliance with
the section 110(a)(2)(D) prohibition. EPA believes it may reasonably take action to make a finding of substantial
inadequacy as soon as EPA has a factual basis to believe that states need to act in order to prevent the pollution transport
problem from continuing past the downwind areas' attainment deadlines. Absent a LEV-equivalent program, EPA believes
it is necessary that the states take action now to adopt the OTC LEV program, and waiting to make this finding may compromise
their ability to achieve the reductions by the time they are needed for timely attainment and maintenance thereafter.
This action is fully justified by the terms of section 110(k)(5). This provision states that ``[w]henever'' EPA makes
the requisite finding of inadequacy, the state is obliged to submit a SIP revision. By its terms, section 110(k)(5)
makes clear that the timing of a SIP call depends only on EPA's determination of inadequacy, and the section does not
contain any provision that would tie SIP calls to any particular point on the SIP development timeline specified in
sections 181 and 182.

EPA's proposed interpretation of sections 110(a)(2)(D) and (k) is best understood in the context of the general statutory
scheme for attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. EPA's April 26 proposal contains a substantial explanation
of the statutory program to address ozone pollution in subpart II of part D of title I added in the 1990 Amendments to
the Act. See 59 FR at 21721&hyph;22 (citing General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992)). As explained there, section 181 provides for the classification of areas according
to their degree of ozone pollution. The greater the degree of pollution, the longer the area has to attain and the more
stringent control measures it must adopt. The classifications and deadlines by which the areas are to attain the ozone
NAAQS are: marginal (1993); moderate (1996); serious (1999); severe (2005 or 2007, depending on the ozone design
value); and extreme (2010). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 establishes the specific requirements and graduated control measures applicable for each type of area.
One basic requirement is that states were to submit emissions inventories by November 1992. A key upcoming requirement
is that, by November 15, 1994, states are to have submitted, for all moderate and above areas, demonstrations that
the states' SIPs will provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS by the relevant attainment dates. As described in detail
in the April 26 notice and the General Preamble, section 182 specifies a host of control requirements that states must
adopt for various areas to ensure progress toward attainment.

Requiring submission of specific SIP revisions pursuant to section 110(k)(5) is consistent with past EPA actions.
Prior to 1990 and the enactment of section 184, EPA required states to submit specific reasonably available control
technology (RACT) control measures applicable to stationary sources as part of a SIP call under section 110(k)(5).
There, EPA's rationale was that:

Because of the relative imprecision of ozone databases and modeling techniques *&blank;*&blank;* EPA historically
has required most areas to include in their control strategies certain stationary source control measures that EPA
believes are reasonably available, and necessary to ensure that the SIP ``provides for'' attainment of the ozone
standard as expeditiously as practicable.

For purposes of implementing the Clean Air Act after December 31, 1987 and prior to the 1990 Amendments, EPA interpreted

See 52 FR at 45062 (Nov. 24, 1987) (footnote added). EPA took this action right away in response to a new list of areas
violating the ozone standard. See 52 FR at 45055; 53 FR 34500 (Sept. 7, 1988); 55 FR 30973 (July 30, 1990). EPA did not
wait for these areas to develop attainment plans before issuing a SIP call requiring them to adopt specific controls
necessary for attainment. Likewise, here EPA is proposing to require submission of the OTC LEV program as necessary
for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D).

EPA believes it has authority under section 110(k)(5) to find that the states' SIPs are substantially inadequate
for lack of the many additional measures needed to fully achieve the emissions reductions necessary to adequately
mitigate transport, but does not believe it should make such a broad finding of substantial inadequacy at this time.
This is because the states are on track to incorporate many additional control measures into their SIPs for purposes
of their attainment demonstration obligations. In preparing these demonstrations, the OTR states are actively
working to adopt regional strategies to address transport. In the ordinary course, EPA believes it should allow states
the first opportunity to address transport in their forthcoming SIP revisions. There is still this opportunity for
states to adopt such other control measures to achieve the necessary reductions in time for downwind states to meet
their attainment deadlines and to maintain the NAAQS thereafter.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 If those efforts do not result in timely adoption of a regional strategy that will provide the emission reductions
needed for attainment and maintenance, EPA may consider making a more comprehensive finding of SIP inadequacy insofar
as other measures in addition to LEV are lacking.

Section 181(a)(1) specified that ozone nonattainment areas are to attain the NAAQS ``as expeditiously as practicable
but not later than'' the dates specified in that section. Based on currently available information, EPA does not believe
that the serious and severe nonattainment areas in the OTR will be able to practicably attain the NAAQS earlier than
the dates specified in section 181(a)(1). This is because these areas will need to rely for attainment on control measures
that depend on equipment turnover that will take time to occur. For this reason, EPA's analysis in this SNPRM is based
on the Agency's belief that the serious and severe attainment dates are the dates specified in section 181(a)(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA does not, however, believe it should wait to find the SIPs inadequate insofar as they lack the LEV program. This
is because the LEV program depends on vehicle fleet turnover that will take an unusually long time to generate the needed
emissions reductions. If EPA waits for the states' attainment demonstrations, the opportunity to ensure that necessary
emissions reductions from the LEV program are achieved beginning in 1999 and growing thereafter may be irrevocably
lost. Any delay in beginning the fleet turnover to LEV vehicles in model year 1999 will diminish the emissions benefits
in the years following. It is therefore necessary for the states to act now to adopt OTC LEV, and appropriate for EPA
to make a finding of substantial SIP inadequacy now with respect to that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, EPA is proposing to find now that the OTR states' SIPs are substantially inadequate insofar as they do not contain
the OTC LEV program. This is because EPA believes that the states need to adopt this program now to mitigate pollution
transport adequately by the attainment deadlines for areas in downwind states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to set a one-year deadline under section 110(k)(5) for OTC LEV SIP submissions. Even though section
110(k)(5) authorizes EPA to allow up to 18 months, EPA believes a one-year deadline is appropriate here. EPA expects
the one-year deadline to fall at the end of calendar year 1995. To ensure implementation of the OTC LEV program in model
year 1999, and given the two-year lead-time requirement of section 177, states must adopt the program before January
2, 1996. If states were given more than about one year to adopt the LEV program, they could not be assured of implementing
it for all 1999 model year vehicles. Since EPA is proposing to conclude that 1999 model year implementation is necessary
to achieve the necessary emissions reductions, it is important that the SIP submission deadline fall in time to meet
the two-year lead-time requirement.

 The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has submitted a response to these constitutional arguments.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 EPA does not believe the arguments that section 184 is unconstitutional have merit. And in any case, given EPA's independent
authority under section 110(k)(5), any constitutional question regarding the validity of section 184 would not
affect the validity of the action proposed today.

The automakers argue that Congress, through section 184, is commandeering the legislative processes of the OTR states
by directly compelling them to take certain actions. The automakers argue that this violates principles of federalism
and the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to mean that Congress
cannot coerce states in their sovereign political capacity to regulate private conduct.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Section 184 is fully within the scheme of ``cooperative federalism'' that the courts have confirmed is consistent
with constitutional requirements.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 As with many other federal programs, section 184 is simply an unremarkable case under the Clean Air Act's SIP program
where Congress has provided incentives to the states as a method of influencing their policy choices. Congress may
attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds (as long as the conditions bear some relation to the purpose of the
federal spending), to influence states' legislative choices. And where Congress has the authority to regulate private
activity under the Commerce Clause, the Court has recognized Congress's power to offer states the choice of regulating
an activity according to federal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Here, Congress provided incentives to the states by placing conditions on highway funding; by allowing states to
apply a less stringent ``offset ratio'' for new stationary pollution sources; and by allowing states to themselves
impose regulations rather than having the federal government implement the program the state chose not to implement.
See sections 179 (highway and offset sanctions) and 110(c)(1) (federal implementation plans).

The automakers also argue that section 184 constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of federal authority to the
OTC and violates the Appointments Clause. They argue that through section 184 Congress delegated legislative authority
outside the federal government, or authorized state officials composing the OTC to exercise significant federal
executive authority that the Constitution commands only federal officials appointed consistent with the Appointments
Clause may exercise. EPA does not, however, believe that state officials exercise ``significant authority'' pursuant
to federal law in this context. EPA welcomes comment on the automakers' constitutional arguments and the response
from NRDC that are in the docket.

D. Consistency of EPA Action With Limitations on Authority Under Sections 177, 202 and 209 of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's proposed action is fully consistent with both the letter and spirit of sections 177, 202 and 209 of the Act. These
three provisions make it clear that Congress wanted auto manufacturers to have to meet only two types of standards_federal
standards and California standards. Section 177 specifically contemplates that California's standards may apply
outside California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approving the OTC's recommendation is doing no more than requiring states, based on need, to exercise authority given
to them by Congress. EPA is authorized to take this action under sections 184 and 110. EPA disagrees with those commenters
that claim sections 177 and 202 preclude EPA from approving the OTC's recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring adoption of the LEV standards in the OTR does not change any current federal standard, so it is not prohibited
by section 202. Section 202(b)(1)(C) explicitly precludes EPA only from exercising its authority under section
202 to modify certain specified standards prior to model year 2004_it is not a general prohibition of all EPA action
relating to the control of emissions from motor vehicles. Thus, EPA may not modify certain mandatory federal standards
applicable nation-wide to motor vehicles until model year 2004. However, today's proposal requires only that states
adopt certain programs applicable to motor vehicles in such states, as states are permitted to do under section 177.
EPA is not proposing to rely on section 202 to require the LEV standards, so the prohibition in 202(b)(1)(C) is irrelevant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The automakers have argued that granting the OTC petition violates section 177 because EPA is making a choice (whether
states should adopt California standards) that section 177 reserves to the states. This misconstrues the nature
of section 177 and fails to read section 177 together with section 110(k)(5) or section 184. Section 177 provides an
exception to the general prohibition in section 209 against states (other than California) adopting motor vehicle
emission standards. Section 177 thus provides states the discretion to adopt controls that section 209 would otherwise
preclude. Sections 110(k)(5) and 184 allow EPA to require states to take actions that would otherwise be left to their
discretion. The language of section 177, that the states' authority applies ``[n]otwithstanding section 209,''
makes clear that Congress intended to provide an exception to section 209, not bar EPA requirements under sections
110 or 184.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's April 26 proposal contains an extensive discussion of the Agency's approach to interpreting the ``necessary''
standard under section 184(c), and includes several options. See 59 FR at 21725&hyph;27. Today, EPA is proposing
its interpretation of this standard. Section 110(k)(5) also includes a ``necessary'' standard providing that,
upon an EPA finding of SIP inadequacy, the Agency is to require that the state submit SIP revisions that are ``necessary''
to correct the inadequacy. EPA is proposing that, in this particular case, the ``necessary'' standard under section
110(k)(5) be interpreted the same as the ``necessary'' standard under section 184(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA approves or partially approves the recommendation, section 184(c)(5) provides that EPA is to issue a finding
that the SIPs for the states to which an approved requirement applies are inadequate to meet the requirements of section
110(a)(2)(D). Section 110(a)(2)(D) provides that SIPs are to contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions
within the state that will ``contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any
other state.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that contributing emissions are significant under section 110(a)(2)(D) at least where controlling
such emissions is necessary to bring any downwind area into attainment. EPA also is proposing that emissions interfere
with downwind maintenance under 110(a)(2)(D) at least where controlling such emissions is necessary for downwind
areas to maintain the NAAQS.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is further proposing to interpret section 184 to mean that the Agency may approve the OTC's recommendation if the
measures are necessary for any area in the OTR to attain or maintain the NAAQS.

EPA is not addressing in this rulemaking whether, under section 110(a)(2)(D), a state's emissions may ``contribute
significantly'' to nonattainment or ``interfere with maintenance'' in another state when controlling the upwind
state's emissions is not strictly necessary but nevertheless would be helpful to downwind states' efforts to attain
and maintain the NAAQS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k)(5) provides that EPA may issue a SIP call whenever it finds a SIP for an area to be substantially inadequate
to attain or maintain the NAAQS, to mitigate adequately interstate transport under sections 176A or 184, or to otherwise
comply with any requirement of the Act. EPA is proposing to interpret section 110(k)(5) to mean that it may issue a SIP
call based on a finding that a SIP does not comply with the requirement of the section 110(a)(2)(D) to address adequately
the effect of pollution transport on downwind attainment and maintenance. EPA may require that the states revise
their SIPs to include any particular measure that is necessary to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the ``necessary'' standard requires the Agency to evaluate the emissions reductions needed, and
then whether reasonable and practicable alternative measures could be adopted instead of the OTC LEV program to achieve
the needed reductions. The role of ``alternatives'' in EPA's analysis has often been confused in the course of EPA's
hearings and round-table proceedings. EPA believes two distinct kinds of alternatives are relevant to necessity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, an alternative program to achieve the same emissions reductions from the same emissions sources may render
the OTC LEV program unnecessary. An example is useful to illustrate this point. If EPA or the states were (hypothetically)
to mandate that all new motor vehicles be ZEVs, then an OTC LEV program would not be necessary_it would not make sense
(and would be unnecessary) to mandate OTC LEV tailpipe standards for a new vehicle fleet consisting entirely of cars
without tailpipes. This would be true regardless of what emissions reductions are needed overall and what other measures
are available to achieve the needed reductions. It is in this sense that EPA believes that OTC LEV would be unnecessary
if there were another program available to achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles comparable to, or
greater than, those from OTC LEV. Under this aspect of the analysis, the ability of the alternative to achieve reductions
sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) is not relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware of alternative programs that currently are under discussion by various interested parties. EPA believes
that some alternative programs could be preferable to simply approving the petition. Such alternatives focus on
a 49-state approach, whereby auto manufacturers would commit to produce cars with a cleaner internal combustion
engine (compared to current federal standards) nationwide. Incentives for advanced technology and zero emission
vehicles are also part of the discussion. As these alternatives are developed and modeling of associated benefits
is undertaken, EPA will add the analyses to the docket and publish a notice of data availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that a 49-state low emission vehicle approach could be better than the OTC LEV program in a number of respects.
First, EPA believes that a 49-state program could have significant environmental benefits as compared to the OTC
LEV program. A 49-state approach could benefit the OTR by reducing incoming pollution from other states_both transported
air pollution and pollution from the migration of non-OTR vehicles into the state (as a result both of tourism and relocation).
A 49-state approach would also help non-OTR states by providing NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC reductions and other air quality benefits. EPA also believes that an alternative could provide equal or greater
impetus to development of advanced technology. Second, the auto industry would benefit from uniform markets. See
discussion in Section IV.A.2.(d) for a discussion of the benefits of uniform markets. The auto industry plays a vital
role in our economy. Reducing the economic impacts of EPA's actions, without reducing environmental benefits are
matters of concern to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once these 49-state alternatives are further developed, EPA intends to complete a qualitative and quantitative
comparison of their environmental benefits relative to the OTC LEV program. The Agency will then publish, as soon
as possible, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The options for developing an alternative program are somewhat limited. As explained above, section 202 bars EPA
modification of the Tier I standards prior to model year 2004, and the states cannot, under section 177 and 209, adopt
standards other than the California standards. Thus, the only alternative method for requiring vehicle manufacturers
to achieve reductions in tailpipe emissions from new light-duty cars and trucks is a program in which manufacturers
voluntarily agree to be bound by more stringent standards. This concept and the legal basis for it are discussed in
greater detail in section V of this notice, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is this first kind of alternative that underlies the basis for EPA providing in its SIP call for the possibility that
an alternative program may be developed that would achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles that are
comparable to or greater than those from OTC LEV. If such a program were developed, it would not be necessary to apply
the OTC LEV program to vehicles subject to the alternative standards. This concept and the legal basis for it are discussed
in greater detail in section V of this notice, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the availability of alternative measures that are sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions without
further reductions from new motor vehicles or trucks could likewise render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. The question
here is not whether EPA will mandate such other measures in response to the OTC's recommendation. The OTC did not recommend
such other measures and; for the reasons described in section III.B., EPA is not ready to consider mandating them under
sections 110(k)(5) and 110(a)(2)(D) at this time. Rather, the question is whether such other measures are available
so that it is unnecessary for EPA to require the OTC LEV program. As EPA explained in its April 26 proposal:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent more reductions will be needed even with the LEV program [to mitigate significant contribution to nonattainment
in the OTR], other measures that address that shortfall would not, for that reason alone, qualify as ``alternatives''
to LEV. Rather, other measures might qualify as ``alternatives'' only if such other measures, singly or in combination,
generate enough reductions to fill the entire shortfall needed without LEV.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

EPA has established a precedent for interpreting the ``necessary'' standard that is consistent with this approach.
EPA's interpretation is guided by its approach to interpreting that term (ultimately codified by Congress), under
section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, as explained in the April 26 proposal. See 59 FR at 21734. That interpretation is important
to evaluating the availability of alternatives sufficient to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Under
section 211(c)(4)(C), controls are necessary if they would still be needed after adoption of all other reasonable
and practicable measures. That is, EPA would consider alternatives available if they are comparatively reasonable
and practicable. And the reasonable and practicable alternatives must be sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions
in order to conclude that the proffered control is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also suggested in its April 26 proposal a different possible approach to the ``necessary'' standard. Under that
approach, EPA might consider as necessary any additional control measures that contribute to attainment, as long
as measures specifically required by the Act or that are otherwise in place are insufficient to achieve attainment.
That is, as long as the States in the OTR still need more reductions to address the transport problem, then EPA would
consider the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program necessary. Assessment of alternative control measures would not
be relevant. See 59 FR at 21725. While EPA is not proposing here to adopt that approach, EPA notes that the facts showing
that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary under the approach discussed in the text would, a fortiori,
be sufficient to show that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary under this different approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, whether potential alternative measures are ``reasonable and practicable'' as well as sufficient to achieve
the necessary reductions may not be self-evident. In its April 26 proposal, EPA described approaches to factual uncertainty
and other policy considerations that could influence these determinations. See 59 FR at 21726&hyph;27. As with its
decisions under section 211(c)(4)(C), here EPA does not consider drastic measures such as gas rationing, or plant
shutdowns to constitute reasonable alternatives to the OTC LEV program. Congress could not have intended that EPA
should consider such drastic alternatives, since such alternatives would clearly be adequate to achieve any necessary
reductions, and hence no proffered measure would ever be necessary. This would essentially read section 184 out of
the Act. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes cost-effectiveness of potential alternatives is a criterion in evaluating reasonableness and comparing
other measures to the measure proffered as necessary. But the comparison of the reasonableness and practicability
of various measures, including what is ``too drastic,'' is a complicated policy determination requiring consideration
of cost and public acceptance, and need not be supported by a highly specific technical record. See 59 FR at 21726. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA believes that it is important to assess the sufficiency of reasonable and practicable alternatives, states
have the continuing opportunity to come forward to adopt sufficient alternatives and prove that the OTC LEV program
indeed turns out to be unnecessary. EPA does not believe states would seriously entertain unreasonable or impracticable
measures to adopt in place of OTC LEV in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. Nonetheless, EPA recognizes
that states which do in fact adopt such other measures sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) might thereby
render the OTC LEV program unnecessary. EPA therefore is proposing that it would retain authority under the SIP call
to change its necessary determination and withdraw its SIP call for those states that adopt controls sufficient to
comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), including those controls EPA might now believe to be unreasonable or impracticable.
As states in the northeast have not yet adopted sufficient measures proving that the LEV program (or LEV-equivalent)
is unnecessary, EPA believes that it should evaluate whether sufficient reasonable and practicable alternatives
exist based on the best current information and policy judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also discussed in its April 26 proposal various approaches to factual uncertainty regarding issues such as cost
and the amount of reductions needed for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D). There, EPA raised the question of whether
the statutory structure, together with the legislative history, support giving substantial weight or ``deference''
to the OTC's recommendation that the OTC LEV program is necessary for attainment in the OTR. EPA suggested that it could
reasonably interpret the provisions to mean that EPA is to start with a presumption of approving the OTC's recommendations
and approve the recommendation unless EPA found that the recommended measures were unnecessary. EPA pointed to floor
statements in the conference debate in the Senate regarding section 184 that EPA bears a ``heavy burden'' to ``demonstrat[e]
that the additional control measure(s) is not necessary.'' See 59 FR at 21726 (quoting Baucus-Chafee Statement of
Managers and Senator Lieberman). EPA's public hearings and round-table discussions reflected some confusion about
the meaning of ``deference'' to the OTC. EPA questions whether there is any basis under any provision of the Clean Air
Act to relieve the Agency of an obligation to consider independently all of the factual information available in determining
whether the OTC LEV program is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, EPA believes the facts affirmatively show that this measure is indeed necessary. In addition, EPA believes
that its general policy of prudence in making decisions regarding highly complex scientific issues affecting public
health should apply to its analysis here. EPA believes this policy is reasonable and permissible in addressing what
is ``necessary'' to achieve and maintain the health-based ambient air quality standard for ozone.

Courts have recognized that scientific evidence is cumulative, and that EPA has discretion to take an environmentally
protective approach to protecting public health and welfare. In Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied,
426 U.S. 941 (1976), the court of appeals considered EPA's action to regulate the lead content of gasoline on grounds
that emissions ``will endanger'' the public health or welfare under prior section 211(c)(1)(A). There, the court
recognized that EPA's decision may be based on ``the inconclusive but suggestive results of numerous studies.''
Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 38. Further, the court found that the Administrator appropriately acted ``conservatively'' based
on ``suggestive'' evidence to make a ``prudent'' determination. Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 39. EPA believes such prudence
is likewise appropriate here, where the public health and welfare is at stake.

EPA believes its general policy in favor of protecting public health and welfare is particularly appropriate to evaluate
whether a particular measure is needed to solve an inter-state problem. EPA believes that pollution transport and
the states' obligations under section 110(a)(2)(D) to control emissions that would contribute to nonattainment
or interfere with maintenance downwind are critical to the integrity of the states' attainment plans under title
I. Especially in a region such as the Northeast, where extensive transport makes states inter-dependent on their
collective pollution control programs, EPA believes that its general policy should apply to make sure that states
adopt controls necessary for other states' attainment. These states depend for their own citizens' health on the
actions of upwind states that may lack an incentive to bear the costs of protecting downwind citizens' health. In such
circumstances, EPA's general policy of prudence is particularly appropriate in evaluating what is necessary in
the upwind states to protect health downwind. Moreover, these states' independent efforts (and their residents'
support for them) to address emissions within their own borders may depend significantly on the confidence these
states have that the other states in the region are acting as ``good neighbors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High officials closely involved in the SIP planning process in these states have now come to EPA, after extensive public
processes of their own, believing a particular measure is necessary for them and their neighbors to do their part to
address a substantially collective public health problem. These officials, as the chief state officers responsible
for ensuring state compliance with the Clean Air Act, are the closest to the air quality planning information in the
states. Whether EPA responds under section 184 or by exercising its authority under section 110(k)(5), EPA believes
that it makes policy sense to apply its general approach of prudence in favor of environmental protection to scientific
uncertainties. EPA believes sound policy dictates that it has a responsibility to do so. The legislative history
reviewed in EPA's April 26 proposal reflects that at least some in Congress intended that EPA follow this approach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent EPA's analysis reveals that other measures are reasonable and practicable but are not sufficient to
achieve the necessary reductions, EPA would have authority directly under section 110(k)(5) to require the states
to adopt those measures, too. But, for the reasons described above in section III.B., EPA does not believe it need exercise
its authority in this manner at this time. Of course, states will need to adopt many of these measures as part of their
attainment demonstrations due November 15, 1994, and this may go a long way toward these states' contribution to downwind
nonattainment or their interference with downwind maintenance. But EPA believes that it should require this measure
now, in light of the states' recommendation, the time needed to yield emissions benefits (due to the lead-time requirement
and time for fleet turnover), and the need for a coordinated decision to adopt the program for the entire region collectively.
Since it is both necessary to address the transport problem and very difficult for the states to adopt the OTC LEV program
without assurance that their neighbors that need to will also do so, the Agency believes that there is adequate reason
to act now to require this measure under sections 184 and 110(k)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that, under this approach, certain states would have to adopt the OTC LEV program even though they did
not vote to make this recommendation to EPA. In its April 26 proposal, EPA questioned whether the ability of certain
states to override the wishes of others by vote could militate against an environmentally conservative approach
to uncertainty. EPA does not view the objection of certain states as justifying a different approach. Rather, EPA
currently believes that the weight of a recommendation from high officials in a majority of the states justifies an
environmentally conservative decision regarding whether the measure in question is necessary. While the minority
states might understandably wish to reserve their options for compliance, their adopted attainment demonstrations
are due in a matter of two months, and the work that those states have accomplished toward assembling their attainment
plans has not convinced EPA that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program will be unnecessary to address the transport
problem. As noted above, EPA believes that even if these officials presented this recommendation without invoking
the formal section 184 process, EPA would appropriately take an environmentally protective approach to deciding
whether to issue a SIP call for the measure directly under section 110(k)(5). Moreover, as discussed above, EPA is
proposing to explore the possibility that alternatives will become available and adopted so that states would no
longer need the OTC LEV program, or that the states may demonstrate that they have adopted sufficient measures without
LEV (potentially including those that EPA might otherwise dismiss as unreasonable or impracticable) to comply with
section 110(a)(2)(D).

i. General Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first step in EPA's analysis of whether the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is needed is to consider what emissions
reductions are necessary to bring all areas into attainment. Based on EPA's region-wide modeling analyses, it is
clear that very large reductions in emissions of both NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC are needed for the serious and severe areas of the OTR to come into attainment. Based on the best analysis available
to EPA to date, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions on the order of 50% to 75% are needed throughout the OTR to reach attainment with the ozone NAAQS.
VOC emissions reductions on the order of 50% to 75% are needed for attainment particularly in the East Coast urban corridor.
These estimates are based on modeling analyses that used a 1985 emissions baseline. Updated inventory information
indicates the 1985 inventory underestimated base case NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions. Therefore, EPA believes that at least a 50% to 75% reduction in emissions is necessary from the 1990
baseline.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Given EPA's belief that in addressing areas of factual uncertainty here it should err on the side of environmental
protection, EPA requests comments on whether reductions from reasonable and practicable measures should be in the
middle of these ranges before EPA would determine that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is unnecessary.

The Clean Air Act requires states to develop 1990 base year emissions inventories of actual emissions on which to base
planning requirements, including attainment demonstrations. Therefore, the remainder of the document will generally
refer to emissions reductions required or obtained from a 1990 emissions inventory. EPA is relying on the above-noted
relationship between the 1985 and 1990 inventory to draw conclusions about necessary emissions reductions from
the 1990 baseline inventory.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has reached these conclusions based on modeling analyses of the impact of emissions reduction strategies for
this region. For purposes of its modeling studies, EPA considered the impact of various strategies in the year 2005.
Focusing first on the impact in 2005 is reasonable because by then all control measures explicitly mandated in subpart
2 of part D of the Act will be in place. EPA can thereby analyze more precisely what reductions beyond those already explicitly
required will be needed. Since two of the three core severe nonattainment areas in the urban corridor along the East
Coast from Washington D.C. to Boston have an attainment deadline of 2005, it is by this date that the Clean Air Act mandates
severe area controls to be in place. These areas are the Baltimore and Philadelphia areas. The New York-New Jersey-Connecticut
severe area has the slightly later attainment deadline of 2007 due to its higher ozone design value. EPA also focused
on this year in its studies in part because the OTC's modeling committee asked that EPA do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note, however, that for purposes of this step in the analysis, the year that is the subject of the study
does not affect the magnitude of necessary emissions reductions. This is because the precise question in this step
is what reductions are needed from a 1990 baseline emissions inventory in order for each of the nonattainment areas
in the OTR to come into attainment. For purposes of this analysis, EPA assumes that all growth in emissions since 1990
must be neutralized in addition to achieving the requisite emissions reductions from the 1990 baseline. That is,
EPA's conclusion is that emission reductions on the order of 50% to 75% in VOC (primarily in the urban areas and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (regionally) are needed in the OTR to reach attainment, and that growth in emissions since 1990 must be neutralized
in addition to the 50% to 75% reductions. Of course, in later years the amount of growth that must be neutralized on top
of the 50% to 75% reductions will increase. But the conclusion that 50% to 75% reductions from the 1990 baseline are
needed remains constant over time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Analytical Modeling Tools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two basic atmospheric modeling tools are used to analyze the need for and effectiveness of various emissions reduction
strategies to attain the ozone NAAQS. These are both photochemical grid models into which information regarding
the atmosphere and emissions is input for subunits in a grid that encompasses a particular area, or ``domain.'' The
model is designed to measure the impact of changes in emissions input for each subunit on the grid. An important aspect
of the models is the set of assumptions regarding the air that enters the modeling domain at its boundaries, commonly
referred to as ``boundary conditions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two basic models used to analyze ozone pollution in the northeast United States are the Urban Airshed Model (UAM)
and the Regional Oxidant Model (ROM). The key differences between these models are the size of the modeling domain
and the resolution of information about subunits in the photochemical grid. The resolution depends on the size of
the overall domain. As their names indicate, the UAM is an urban scale model that yields more precise information about
particular urban areas, and the ROM is a broader regional model that is more useful for assessing regional impacts.
The UAM generally involves a modeling domain on the order of 200 km on a side, with a horizontal resolution of five km
or better and five or more vertical layers.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is using a ROM to analyze the domain encompassing the United States east of 99W longitude, covering approximately
the eastern half of the country. Horizontal resolution is approximately 18 km, with three vertical layers considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Grid models, such as the UAM and the ROM, entail superimposing a 3-dimensional box over the area to be modeled. This
box is subdivided into grid cells. The model predicts average concentration within each cell for each hour of a simulation.
The spatial resolution possible with a model is defined by the size of these individual grid cells. The models do not
allow one to draw conclusions about concentrations averaged over areas which are smaller than the size of the individual
grid cells.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The UAM is particularly useful to demonstrate with fine resolution whether urban areas will achieve attainment using
a particular emissions reduction strategy, based on assumptions about the boundary conditions of the UAM domain.
The ROM is useful for assessing the relationship between UAM domains and what is happening in the broader region to
determine appropriate boundary conditions for UAM modeling. The function of ROM applications for developing attainment
strategies is to provide boundary conditions for the UAM analyses. Essentially, boundary conditions are estimates
of the amount of ozone and ozone precursors entering each of the UAM domains from upwind. Boundary conditions reflect
the cumulative effect of pollutant transport as well as control measures and growth applied in upwind areas. Upwind
areas for purposes of the ROM analysis include upwind UAM domains, portions of the OTR outside the UAM domains, and
the eastern U.S. outside the OTR. The boundary conditions resulting from these ROM simulations serve as an important
input to the states' UAM analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modeling using the UAM and ROM tools is an iterative process. First, UAM yield information about the strategies and
impacts of strategies in smaller areas. The information from these models can then be fed into the ROM to yield information
about the collective impact of the UAM assumptions throughout the region. The strategies in each area impact other
areas downwind as the air moves from one area to another. The ROM then yields information about the appropriate boundary
conditions to be input into the next round of each area's UAM. Each iteration in this process yields more refined information
about the effect of strategies in the UAM domains and the appropriate boundary conditions for each UAM domain. In sum,
the UAM is useful to assess the precise strategies in isolated nonattainment areas; the ROM is useful to assess the
relationship between areas in light of their interdependence because of a common transported air mass throughout
the region and to provide boundary conditions for further UAM modeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act requires that the states submit modeled demonstrations of attainment to EPA on or before November
15, 1994. As described, states will be using the UAM with input from the ROM applications to make these modeled demonstrations,
though none have yet been completed and submitted to EPA for review. In the OTR, the states will model four urban areas
using the UAM: (1) New England; (2) New York City/Connecticut/northern New Jersey; (3) Philadelphia/New Jersey/Maryland;
and (4) Baltimore/Maryland/Washington D.C. These urban areas are so close together and so inter-dependent that
each of these four UAM modeling domains overlaps portions of at least one of the other four. EPA does not expect the states
to complete UAM modeling analysis for the four urban areas that demonstrates that a particular control strategy will
achieve attainment (relying on ROM applications through the iterative process discussed above), until well after
November 1994. EPA's analysis of the need for the LEV program relies principally on several past and ongoing ROM studies.
While EPA could use the complete UAM studies to refine the analysis, EPA believes ROM is the more important modeling
tool for assessing transport. EPA further believes that certain conclusions can now be drawn about the outcome of
the UAM analyses with respect to transport. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has used the ROM over the past several years to study national policies and strategies for reducing ozone.
Because of the large domain subject to a ROM analysis, this tool is well-suited for assessing effects of regional strategies
on regional transport of ozone and its precursors. ROM provides vital information for the states to consider in choosing
sets of individual measures within each nonattainment area for purposes of their attainment demonstrations. EPA
has applied ROM in various studies since 1988 to assess regional effects of control strategies. For purposes of assessing
the amount of reductions needed to attain the ozone NAAQS throughout the OTR, EPA reviewed the results of these ROM
studies. These studies analyzed impacts of various control strategies using data from the actual ozone exceedance
episode in July 1988. During these particular episodes, the ROM model predicted that two sub-regions in the OTR would
have hourly ozone concentrations over 180 ppb (50% over the ozone NAAQS), even after application of the control measures
specifically mandated in the Act.

 reductions in the rural and suburban areas can be important even where such areas are not themselves violating the
NAAQS, because the ozone and ozone precursors from these areas are transported into the nonattainment areas, exacerbating
conditions in the nonattainment areas. EPA concluded that VOC reductions on the order of 70%&hyph;90% from 1985

 levels would be needed to reduce ozone levels to comply with the level specified in the NAAQS in several of the large

While these studies used a regional 1985 emission inventory as the baseline, it is the 1990 emissions baseline that
is of particular concern in determining whether LEV is necessary for attainment. Under the Act, states are required
to submit comprehensive 1990 inventories of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions upon which to base their air quality planning, including their attainment demonstrations. EPA
believes that, based on current, recently updated information, both the matrix and ROMNET studies relied on assumptions
about the emissions inventory that underestimated base case VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 This is because inventories used in both the matrix and ROMNET studies were based on older estimates compiled for the
National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP).
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 For example, EPA believes that inventory assumptions in the matrix study underestimated 1990 baseline emissions
in the OTR for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 16% and VOC by about 38%. Correcting the inventory assumptions in the matrix study should therefore result in modeling
results that reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions needed for attainment throughout the OTR are even greater than described above. EPA does not have
a precise comparison between the current inventory information and the assumptions relied on in the ROMNET study,
but a comparable difference is likely based on the difference between the current recently updated inventory and
the older NAPAP-based inventory used in ROMNET. Based on these ROM modeling studies and analysis of 1985 and 1990 emission
inventory assumptions, EPA concludes that, at a minimum, 50% to 75% reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 throughout the OTR and VOC in and near the urban areas emissions will be necessary for regional attainment from the
1990 baseline.

The second step in EPA's analysis is to assess the degree to which transport contributes to the ozone problem in the
OTR. As explained in the April 26 notice, EPA believes that the ``need'' for additional measures in the OTR in order
to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D) focuses primarily on the states' need to adopt the program in question for the
benefit of areas downwind. See 59 FR at 21728. Of course, the states retain full authority to adopt the LEV program under
section 177 for their own benefit without EPA approval. As explained below, analysis of what reductions are needed
for any specific area to avoid causing ozone exceedances downwind is an enormously complicated task that depends
on regional, urban, and wind trajectory modeling information and monitoring data. Further, the analysis of the controls
necessary in an upwind area depends on the controls assumed in the web of downwind areas and other upwind areas. In dealing
with these complications and uncertainties, EPA emphasizes that the lead-time together with the lengthy time needed
for fleet turnover in order to obtain the benefits from the OTC LEV program support reaching a decision now based on
the best data currently available. Based on this data, EPA's conclusion is that very large reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions on the order of 50% to 75% throughout the OTR are necessary for the serious and severe nonattainment areas
in the OTR to attain the ozone standard by their respective attainment dates. EPA also believes that a similar magnitude
of reductions in VOC emissions is necessary primarily in and near the urban areas of the OTR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because ROM is useful to assess regional strategies in light of the transport of ozone and ozone precursors across
a region, and is therefore critical to establishing boundary conditions for UAM models, it is also useful to assess
the degree of transport across a region. The ROM studies discussed above therefore are a critical component of the
best current information regarding the extent to which upwind areas contribute to exceedances of the ozone standard
in downwind areas throughout the OTR. Use of these studies, together with regional trajectory analyses, to assess
contribution between areas, is consistent with EPA's published guidance for conducting contribution analyses.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 The OTC, too, relied on these approaches consistent with EPA's published guidance to establish the importance of
addressing pollution that is transported throughout the OTR and to thereby support its recommendation that the LEV
program is necessary region-wide.

EPA believes that the ROM studies, together with regional trajectory analyses, show that the large percentage reductions
in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC discussed above (on the order of 50% to 75% reductions, with somewhat less emphasis on VOC reductions outside
the urban areas) are needed throughout the OTR for purposes of the downwind nonattainment areas to attain the NAAQS.
EPA recognizes that these conclusions are based on ROM and trajectory analyses for the OTR as a whole, and that factual
uncertainty remains regarding the precise degree of contribution for individual small subunits of the modeled domain
to ozone violations in other areas, and the amount of emissions reductions needed to prevent such contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess such contribution for each subunit in the grid would require a myriad of sensitivity tests that are extremely
complicated. This is because contribution from one area to another can be enormously difficult to isolate. The significance
of any particular area's contribution depends on the controls that have been implemented in other areas that share
the same airshed. The interrelationship between the ROM and UAM models illustrates this point. The strategies needed
in the urban areas depend on what is being done in other areas that affects UAM boundary conditions, and the strategies
applied in all of the areas determines the boundary conditions. In short, upwind areas may need to do somewhat less
to avoid causing downwind exceedances if the downwind areas themselves do more, but the upwind areas may need to do
more if the downwind areas do less. And this relationship must account for such variables in the many areas that share
air throughout the northeast.

While recognizing these complications and the associated factual uncertainties, modeling and wind trajectory
analyses show that emissions transport from OTR areas in an arc extending from the south and southwest to the northwest
substantially affect nonattainment areas along the East Coast urban corridor. The OTC's technical support document
for its recommendation
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 contains several analyses that support this conclusion. These analyses relate wind trajectory data to monitored
ozone data during three multi-day ozone exceedance episodes in 1992 and 1993, as well as the July 1988 episode that
was the subject of the ROMNET study discussed above. These analyses also relate monitoring data at mountaintop sites
during these episodes that indicate a broad region-wide buildup of ozone as the episodes progress. For the 1992 and
1993 episodes, the wind trajectory data together with the timing of high ozone readings at relatively rural sites
in the northern part of the OTR support the conclusion that transport from the East Coast urban corridor toward the
northeast portions of the OTR leads to high regional ozone over a prolonged period.

The analysis of the July 1988 episode relies heavily on EPA's ROMNET study. The ROMNET results indicate that emissions
within the East Coast urban corridor have a dominant impact on predicted ozone levels within the corridor when emissions
levels are very high. The conclusion that corridor-wide emissions play a dominant role in affecting predicted high
ozone concentrations is consistent with findings in a subsequent study EPA has performed for the OTC.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The ROMNET study separately modeled the impact of similar large percentage reductions (60%) in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions first in OTR nonattainment areas, second in OTR attainment areas and third in the four states bordering
the OTR. The modeling showed that ozone levels in the urban corridor were more sensitive to reductions in the nonattainment
areas (which are mostly in the urban corridor). This was because the actual quantity of emissions and hence the amount
eliminated through a 60% reduction was greater in the urban corridor, and because these reductions were closer to
the problem. However, as shown in the ROMNET study, emissions from outside the urban corridor have an increasingly
important impact as the emissions within the corridor are reduced. Since modeling indicates that very large reductions
inside the urban corridor are needed to approach the NAAQS, EPA expects that large reductions outside the urban corridor
will also become increasingly important and in fact necessary for the nonattainment areas in the urban corridor to
reach the NAAQS.

In addition to the study of these three episodes on which the OTC relied, EPA has reviewed additional surface and aloft
wind trajectory information. This information was generated from ROM wind fields for each of the days analyzed in
the four UAM modeling studies for purposes of attainment demonstrations currently underway for the four UAM modeling
domains in the OTR. In all, EPA analyzed twenty-five days during 1987, 1988 and 1991. EPA has found that on more than
80% of these days surface winds
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 are from the south to southwesterly direction. This surface wind orientation is consistent with a large cumulative
impact of emissions along the northeast urban corridor. EPA also found that, on about 70% of the days, winds aloft
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 originate from directions ranging from west-southwest through northwest. This wind aloft orientation is consistent
with a longer range impact on the northeast urban corridor from sources located anywhere from the west-southwest
through the northwest of each of the OTR nonattainment areas in the urban corridor. This would include sources in the
western and northwestern portions of the OTR and beyond.

Even though the UAM analyses for purposes of the attainment demonstrations are not yet complete, EPA believes certain
conclusions can now be drawn about the outcome with respect to transport. The episodes selected for these UAM analyses
were chosen on the basis of high observed ozone concentrations. In other words, the prevailing meteorological conditions
on these days were right for ozone formation. These episodes correspond with wind trajectory information that indicates
a large impact from emissions transported across the region. These wind trajectories will therefore also be used
in the ROM analyses to generate the boundary conditions for feedback into the UAM analyses. These UAM analyses are
the basis for the attainment demonstrations for the OTR, and they are therefore likely to indicate that regional controls
are critical to demonstrating attainment for the four UAM domains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

An additional source of specific information about transport along the urban corridor is the calculation of boundary
conditions for Washington/Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and New England for July 7, 1988.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 This is the only day subject to modeling in all four UAM domains in the OTR. Estimates of the surface winds for this day
are consistently from the south-southwest for all four domains. Both predicted and observed values for the boundary
conditions for the UAM domains are above or approaching the level of the NAAQS (120 ppm). And the modeled values show
a clear tendency to increase moving northeast along the corridor, thus supporting the conclusion that the emissions
accumulate as they are transported up the corridor.

wind trajectories were from the west or northwest. For most of these days, predicted and observed boundary conditions
are on the order of 50&hyph;90 ppb with one exception on June 22, 1988 for New York. The data for the day with higher boundary
conditions are presented in the following table. The mean values in the table represent the concentrations averaged

Predicted ozone values at the western boundary of the domain for this day are also on the order of 100 ppb. On this day,
the ROM trajectories indicate light surface winds prevailed. The data in the table support the conclusion that these
high boundary conditions result at least in part from long range transport from the western and northwestern OTR.
This, together with all the other information available, further supports the conclusion that controls in the western
and northwestern portions of the OTR are necessary for attainment throughout the region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA has compiled back-trajectories calculated from ROM for each of the four UAM domains for all days selected
for modeling. The results generally support the conclusion that surface winds from the south through west-southwest
and winds aloft from the northwest to south-southwest transport pollutants across the OTR. This, together with all
of the other available information, supports EPA's conclusion that large emission reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in both the northeast urban corridor and upwind areas located to the far south-through-northwest of the nonattainment
areas in the urban corridor are necessary, and that large emissions reductions in VOC at least in and near the urban
corridor are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, EPA analyzed ozone monitoring data, wind trajectory data, and information derived from several analytical
techniques and modeling studies. All of these analyses in combination lead EPA to conclude that large scale regional
transport is a critical component of the ozone nonattainment problem in the OTR. It is clear that to reach attainment
in the northeast urban corridor, the nonattainment areas themselves will have to implement very extensive emission
control programs for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC to counteract their contribution to ozone violations in their immediate areas and further downwind toward
the northeast. Also, EPA believes, based on best current information, that large reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are necessary throughout areas located from the south through the west and northwest, and that large VOC
reductions are necessary for at least the urban portions of the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Analysis of Inventory and Options for Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having assessed the magnitude of reductions needed throughout the OTR, the next step in EPA's analysis is to assess
the options available for achieving the necessary 50% to 75% reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 across the OTR and in VOC for the urban parts of the OTR. In doing so, EPA first assessed the best available information
about the inventory of emissions across the OTR. Then EPA proceeded to consider various potential control measures
to reduce these emissions by the necessary amount. As discussed above in section IV.A.1. and in the April 26 notice,
EPA considered options that are at least potentially reasonable and practicable in light of the OTC LEV program. Based
on this analysis, EPA believes that no combination of potentially reasonable and practicable controls on large and
small stationary point sources, area sources, highway vehicles, offroad mobile sources, and fuels will be sufficient
to achieve the necessary reductions without more stringent standards for new motor vehicles. And the only option
legally available to the states for achieving the necessary further reductions from new motor vehicles is the OTC
LEV program.

 and VOC emissions are based on modeling which used the 1985 NAPAP emissions inventory. However, as stated above, EPA
believes that the amount of reductions necessary from the 1990 baseline are comparable to, or perhaps greater than
the reductions from the 1985 inventory. This means that controls must counteract growth in emissions to produce a
reduction from the emissions levels in 1990 of at least 50&hyph;75%. Inventories reflecting growth and controls
need to be compared to the approximate reduction targets to fully evaluate the need for a LEV program. The table below
indicated that light-duty vehicles (and mobile sources in general) represent a substantial portion of the OTR inventory

 and VOC emissions, therefore, constitute a major portion of the emissions in the OTR, and it is reasonable to conclude
that a workable compliance plan for the OTR must include substantial controls on motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, because the LEV program would achieve emissions reductions primarily from gasoline-powered vehicles,
it may be useful to separate the projected mobile source emissions into gasoline and diesel components. EPA estimates

ii. Analysis of Options for Control Measures Without More Stringent New Motor Vehicle Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section reviews options for control measures that could potentially render the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent)
unnecessary in the OTR. As will be discussed, EPA has determined that such measures do not provide sufficient emissions
reductions without LEV and that therefore LEV is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating control options, EPA considered measures that it believes are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable
(and are thus potentially reasonable and practicable). This does not mean that EPA believes that such measures are
in fact reasonable and practicable. Rather, EPA believes that for purposes of assessing whether states might adopt
other reasonable and practicable measures to achieve the needed reductions without OTC LEV, it should consider all
measures that are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable.

34&hyph;35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA did not consider measures such as mandatory plant shutdowns, gas rationing, and bans on ownership of high-emitting
vehicles because the Agency believes these are clearly unreasonable or impracticable to impose in comparison to
the OTC LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA does not intend its consideration of particular measures here to suggest that the Agency believes such measures
constitute reasonably available control technology (RACT) or reasonably available control measures (RACM) as
those terms of art are used in the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As EPA explained in its April 26 notice and in section III.A.1. above, the Agency believes that cost-effectiveness
of control options is one criterion in evaluating whether they are clearly unreasonable and impracticable. EPA believes
that it should consider additional factors, such as extreme economic and societal costs, disruptions, distributional
impacts, and public acceptance, that would warrant the conclusion that Congress would not have had the Agency consider
particular measures to be viable options for finding other measures unnecessary. See 59 FR at 21726. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing options for control measures, EPA relied, in part, on the same ROM modeling studies EPA used to assess
the overall magnitude of reductions needed in the OTR. These studies are useful to check whether the impact of specific
control strategies corresponds with predictions about the overall magnitude of reductions. See sections IV.A.2.(a)
and (b), above. The first ROM study analyzed the impact of the control measures explicitly mandated in the Act for OTR
areas. The second study is the 1991 ROMNET ``matrix'' study of the impact of a series of uniform reductions in emissions
of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, VOC or both. As discussed above, EPA reached conclusions about necessary emissions reduction targets from these
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the analysis, EPA first quantified the impact of the measures required by the Act. Next, EPA evaluated an array of
additional control options that are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable that could be implemented in addition
to the mandatory measures. EPA then surveyed other potentially reasonable and practicable control measures to determine
whether those options are sufficient to make up the shortfall which exists after application of the mandatory measures
without the OTC LEV program. These other control options include the maximum region-wide limit on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Plans for three areas in California, and measures listed in compilations of NO

 and VOC controls prepared by EPA and the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators/Association
of Local Air Pollution Control Officials (STAPPA/ALAPCO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA considered both NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC control measures, but focused primarily on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions on the order of 50%&hyph;75% are needed region-wide, while a similar magnitude of VOC reductions are necessary
primarily in or near the East Coast urban corridor. EPA believes that there are insufficient potentially reasonable
and practicable measures to achieve the necessary NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions region-wide without the LEV program. This is a sufficient basis for approval of the OTC's recommendation
and for issuing a finding that the SIPs are substantially inadequate to meet section 110(a)(2)(A) without the LEV
program for the entire region. EPA also believes that there are insufficient potentially reasonable and practicable
measures to achieve the necessary VOC reductions in and near the urban areas, which constitutes an additional basis
for approving the OTC's recommendation and for making a finding of substantial inadequacy with regard to interstate
transport for those areas.

EPA used an 80% Rule Effectiveness value in calculating the overall effectiveness of control measures. Rule effectiveness
was applied to all controls that were not an irreversible process change (for which 100% effectiveness was assumed).
Thus, for the controls that consider Rule Effectiveness the emission reduction due to a particular control device
was calculated as the product of the control efficiency and the Rule Effectiveness value. For example, a device that
controls at a level of 75% would produce an emissions reduction of only 60% (i.e. 0.75 &times; 0.80). Rule effectiveness
is explained in detail in this section, below.

One commenter asked that EPA, in assessing the need for the OTC LEV program, consider the potential for emissions reductions
from landfills. EPA has proposed a new source performance standard (NSPS) for landfills and proposed guidelines
for existing landfill sources. See 56 FR 24468 (May 30, 1991). EPA expects to take final action on the NSPS and the guidance
by December 1994. EPA has taken the resulting emissions reductions into account among the Clean Air Act mandatory
measures.

 and 37% for VOC from the 1990 baseline. As discussed above in sections IV.A.2.(a) and (b), EPA believes this level of
reductions will not be sufficient to attain the ozone NAAQS throughout the OTR. Confirming this conclusion, ROM studies
of four episodes applying these measures in 2005 for all days being modeled in the four UAM domains in the OTR yield predictions
of ozone levels above the 120 ppb NAAQS in five OTR subregions. These subregions include the UAM domains for Baltimore/Washington,
Philadelphia, New York City and New England, and west/central Pennsylvania. Further, the model predicts ozone levels
would exceed 160 ppb in at least one subregion for each of the episodes.

EPA notes that these percentage reductions are from a 2005 projected baseline. EPA's conclusion that a 50%&hyph;75%
reduction in emissions is from a 1990 inventory baseline. It is important to bear in mind throughout this analysis
that the 1990 baseline inventory is substantially larger than the projected 2005 baseline, which presumes application
of mandatory Clean Air Act controls. Therefore, percentage reductions that particular measures achieve from the
2005 are larger than the percentage reductions those same measures would achieve if calculated from the 1990 baseline.

&bull;Transportation Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also considered transportation control measures (TCMs) as potentially reasonable and practicable measures
available for the OTR. There are a wide range of TCMs that have been proposed, but EPA believes that many of them, such
as gasoline rationing, are unreasonable and impracticable here. Two options that EPA considers potentially reasonable
and practicable are the extension of the Employee Commute Option (ECO) program region-wide and implementation of
a comprehensive system of congestion pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration fees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Act mandates that the severe areas in the OTR adopt employee trip reduction programs (also
known as ECO programs). Under these programs, each employer with more than one hundred employees must offer incentives
and encouragement for employees to travel to work by means other than single-occupant vehicles. The eventual goal
of the program is to achieve a 25% increase in vehicle occupancy for morning commuting trips. This is equivalent to
one out of five employees using a mode of commuting, other than driving. EPA's best case estimate of the benefits of
extending the ECO program region-wide is a three percent reduction in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) in the OTR. This
reduction in VMT would correspond to approximately a two percent reduction in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions from light-duty vehicles in the OTR, and to a 0.6% reduction in overall NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions and a 0.4% reduction in overall VOC emissions from the 2005 baseline. The incremental amount of reductions
is limited because the program would only affect the limited number of large employers outside the severe areas and
because commuting trips are only a fraction of overall trips and VMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second TCM option is a comprehensive system of fees and incentives designed to affect driving habits and vehicle
usage. These controls, including congestion pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration
fees, are described in the Cameron Report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These measures could possibly achieve a 12% reduction in car and light-truck VMT in the OTR. This would correspond
to a 12% reduction in NO

The use of California reformulated gasoline in the OTR is another option that has been mentioned. This program would
generate limited additional emissions reductions in the OTR. California reformulated gasoline achieves greater
emissions reductions than Federal reformulated gasoline, due to the different specifications for the California
fuel, such as a lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). EPA estimates that the implementation of California reformulated
gasoline in the OTR could provide an approximate six to seven percent reduction in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

EPA also considered additional emission reduction measures that the Agency has included in a proposed Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP) for the Ventura, Sacramento, and South Coast areas of California. See 59 FR 23263 (May 5, 1994). As the following
discussion indicates, the measures proposed for consideration in these FIPs which are not unreasonable or impracticable
and which could be implemented by the states in the OTR, have largely been considered as part of other strategies discussed
above. Those that remain would not generate a substantial reduction in emissions from the overall inventory.

Context Surrounding FIP Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The court-ordered obligation that EPA produce FIPs for three regions of California has placed EPA in an unusual position.
The Clean Air Act places primary responsibility for clean air planning at the regional, state and local levels. This
is appropriate because state and local officials have the specific knowledge, flexibility, and sensitivity to tailor
clean air plans to the particular needs of their communities. Throughout the FIP development process, EPA has acknowledged
that the measures at its disposal include blunt instruments that have the potential for significant social and economic
impact. Also, the time constraints imposed by the court order and the functional limits on EPA's ability to fashion
measures which meet the specific needs of localities have forced the Agency to propose a number of measures that would
not be appropriate for implementation in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pollution problems experienced in California are of a magnitude far greater than those experienced anywhere
else in the nation. Moreover, the OTC, with its recommendation here, seeks to benefit from the leadership California
has demonstrated in setting strict pollution standards for new vehicles. The measures proposed in the FIP generally
supplement measures California has already adopted. The LEV program is a critical aspect of California's attainment
strategy and the FIP. When considering whether FIP measures may constitute part of a set of measures sufficient to
achieve the necessary reductions in the OTR without the LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program, it is essential to stress
that EPA proposed these measures for California in addition to the LEV program that California had already adopted
in 1990. If the LEV program had not already been adopted, EPA would have had to propose a measure very much like it for
the FIP, due to the substantial and relatively cost-effective benefits that the program will provide in California.

Description of FIP Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this discussion, EPA has grouped proposed FIP measures into four broad categories: (1) FIP measures
that are not practicable in the OTR because they depend on federal authority to be implemented or are predicated on
special regulatory authority Congress has conferred only upon California; (2) FIP measures that are clearly unreasonable
and impracticable in the OTR because they are predicated upon industrial or geographic circumstances that are particular
to California; (3) FIP measures that are unreasonable and impracticable in the OTR relative to LEV implementation
because they are too costly or speculative; and (4) FIP measures which are not clearly unreasonable or impracticable
for implementation in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Measures excluded because they depend on unique authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal Authority_EPA proposed two different types of FIP measures relying on EPA's unique federal authority.
Most were measures that would apply nationally, such as recreational marine vessel controls, and thus would apply
in the OTR, as well. Additionally, EPA proposed some parts of the FIP solely under authority accorded to the Agency
under the FIP provisions in section 110(c). These parts of the FIP regulated source categories including new locomotives
and farm and construction equipment under 175 hp. See section 209(e)(1). These proposed FIPs would rely on section
110(c) to impose requirements for these sources that are more stringent than EPA has proposed for the nation as a whole.
All states, including California, are preempted from regulating this category of sources. Therefore, no state in
the OTR has the option of adopting these controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. State Authority_California has authority under section 209 of the Act to address pollution from on-highway and
nonroad engines (except certain categories of nonroad engines noted above), which other states do not have. In the
FIP proposal, EPA stepped into the shoes of California and proposed several measures under California's section
209 authority for California only. Generally, these measures are tight new emission standards for new on-highway
and nonroad equipment. EPA also proposed certain measures to improve durability of on-highway and nonroad equipment
to better control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions in-use. EPA again proposed these programs under California's special authority that other states do not
have. Because states are preempted from adopting such regulations in the absence of California regulations actually
adopted under California's Clean Air Act authority, states in the OTR do not now have the option of adopting any of these
controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) FIP measures that are impracticable in the OTR because they are predicated upon industrial or geographic circumstances
that are particular to California.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed several programs for the FIP that deal with circumstances unique to California's industrial and geographic
circumstances and are therefore inappropriate for the OTR. For example, due to the fire hazards inherent in an arid
region, California fire departments burn vegetation periodically to lower the risk of a wild fire. EPA proposed that
these burns only occur on certain days so that the pollution from the fire does not add to ozone exceedances. Since such
burns do not occur in the OTR, such requirements would not make sense there. The rules regarding outer continental
shelf oil exploration are another example of rules which may make sense in California but not in the OTR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) FIP measures that are unreasonable or impracticable in the OTR because they are too costly or disruptive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FIP contains ``cap'' rules for stationary sources which impose an annual rate of reduction on affected sources
for as many controllable VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 categories as possible. The emission reduction targets are derived from the overall shortfall in the FIP area rather
than any consideration of available emission control technologies. EPA's proposal anticipates that the state and
local agencies can over time develop carefully tailored economic incentive programs or traditional rules based
upon the most recent technologies and regulatory approaches. But the cap rules themselves are not examples of specific
regulatory approaches to be adopted at the state or local level. These are therefore blunt instruments without specific
and identifiable emissions control mechanisms in mind. As such, they may be costly to achieve and EPA cannot now conclude
that they are based on technologies that are potentially practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 2004, the FIP also proposes to discourage the use of older high polluting recreational boat engines through
the imposition of a user fee and permit system. EPA believes that measures which restrict individual behavior or prevent
citizens from benefitting from investments made in property are particularly difficult to implement. EPA does not
believe it is reasonable to adopt such measures before implementation of the LEV standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Proposed FIP measures which are not clearly unreasonable and impracticable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the proposed FIP measures are based on national, state and local initiatives that EPA does not believe it should
dismiss as clearly unreasonable or impracticable. Nationally, there are a variety of standards for stationary and
mobile sources. California initiatives include the LEV program itself, as well as other measures applicable to consumer
products. The FIP proposal also takes into account local efforts in the affected California areas to reduce NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from stationary and mobile sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is in the process of developing many national rules that it took into account in the FIP proposal and that it therefore
expects to apply in the OTR. For example, apart from the FIP proposal, EPA is developing by November 1995, nation-wide
emission standards for new marine engines. EPA is also developing standards for locomotives and small nonroad engines
under 25 hp. California has also developed rules to reduce VOC emissions from paints and other consumer products and
EPA is developing similar controls on the VOC content of consumer and commercial solvents and architectural coatings.
EPA has already accounted for the benefits of all of these measures for the OTR above, in its modeling of the impact of
the mandatory Clean Air Act measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local areas in California, especially the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast), have been especially
innovative in developing emissions reduction programs. There are two programs that EPA took into account in its FIP
proposal which merit special comment here. First, the South Coast developed an ECO program to reduce the number of
vehicle miles travelled to and from major employers. As discussed above, the Clean Air Act now requires many nonattainment
areas to implement ECO programs. EPA proposed in the FIP to expand coverage to Sacramento. As discussed above, the
ECO programs already required for certain areas in the OTR could be expanded region-wide, or applied to smaller employers
than currently mandated. However, as noted above, the incremental benefits from these programs appear to be relatively
small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The South Coast has also developed a new program that EPA took into account in its FIP proposal, known as the Regional
Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM), to establish a declining cap on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from stationary sources. Unlike the South Coast, however, large stationary NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources in the OTR are dominated by coal-fired utilities. In place of a declining NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Consideration of Rule Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating the emissions reductions attributable to particular control measures, it is important to consider
the effectiveness of the rules. If all sources fully comply with the rules at all times, and if there were never problems
with control equipment, then the emission reductions associated with control measures could be calculated and summed
to reflect the anticipated reductions as a result of applying specific regulations. However, past history has shown
that rules are not consistently applied or enforced, control equipment malfunctions, and operating and maintenance
problems occur, all contributing to air emissions. These emissions are accounted for through the application of
rule effectiveness (RE) guidelines. This is a means of identifying and estimating the increased emissions failures
and uncertainties in emission control programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a rule actually achieves its desired emission reductions. It
accounts for a variety of factors that influence the efficacy of emission control programs, including: the nature
of the regulation or control (e.g., complexity of record-keeping or test methods); nature of control techniques
(e.g., potential for fugitive emissions); performance of sources in complying with the regulation (e.g., schedule
of maintenance and inspection of control equipment); and performance of those enforcing the regulation (e.g., inspector
training). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA accounts for RE for mobile source controls that affect the mobile emissions factors internally in the MOBILE model.
For stationary sources, however, the emissions inventory must account for RE to yield more reliable estimates of
the actual emissions reductions that SIP rules will achieve. In general, EPA specifies an 80 percent default RE value
in the absence of a local category-specific RE value. In essence, this assumes that the ability to use control devices
or regulations to achieve emission reductions is only 80 percent effective. Without application of RE to the emissions
inventory, the emissions reductions estimated to occur as a result of control measures would be overly optimistic.
Although EPA's analysis of measures mandated in the Act accounts for RE, the emissions reductions assumed for the
other measures may not have accounted for REs and must therefore be considered overly optimistic.

 Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described above, EPA believes reductions in the range of 50% to 75% from 1990 baseline NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions levels will be needed to enable all of the serious and severe nonattainment areas in the OTR to attain
the ozone standard. The NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions are needed throughout the OTR and the VOC reductions are needed at least in and near the urban portions of
the OTR. EPA recognizes that there are uncertainties in its modeling analysis used to reach this conclusion. For the
reasons described earlier in this notice, EPA believes it would be appropriate generally to resolve uncertainties
in its factual analysis in favor of the most environmentally conservative course. EPA requests comment on whether,
for purposes of its analysis of alternative control measures, EPA should conclude that the middle of this range, or
at least a 65% reduction from baseline NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, will be necessary throughout the OTR. Here, as described below, EPA believes that focus on the low end of
the range would not change its conclusion. In addition to uncertainties in the atmospheric models, uncertainties
also exist in the base year emissions inventories, the projected emissions that account for growth in the future,
the amount of emission reductions estimated to result from implementation of the control measures (including consideration
of rule effectiveness), and the modeled ozone concentrations resulting from the emissions. Additionally, EPA believes
that it should err on the side of environmental protection in addressing these uncertainties.

In addition, the transportation control measures that EPA would not consider clearly impracticable or unreasonable
(including expanded geographic coverage of ECO programs and implementation of a comprehensive system of congestion
pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration fees, and the versions of those measures included
in EPA's FIP proposal), would yield a combined reduction of 2.5% from 1990 baseline inventory-wide NO

It is apparent that the combined NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the entire set of these measures would be significantly short of the 65% NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction EPA believes is needed throughout the OTR for attainment in the serious and severe nonattainment areas
of the region. As a result, those areas will not be able to attain the standard through application of all of the potentially
practicable measures, without NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions from more stringent emissions standards for new vehicles region-wide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After evaluating the control measures discussed above, EPA concludes that the emissions reductions resulting from
application of potentially reasonable and practicable control measures will not be sufficient to achieve attainment
throughout the OTR without more stringent new vehicle emission standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mobile source emissions comprise a significant part of the 2005 NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions inventories. Indeed, EPA believes that, apart from its analysis of each potentially reasonable
control option independently, the reasonableness and practicability of adopting all these controls measures without
adopting more stringent standards for new motor vehicles is questionable. And for NOx, while additional emissions
reductions from other source categories will be important to meet the attainment goal, EPA believes the measures
will be needed in addition to, rather than in place of, more stringent controls for new motor vehicles throughout the
OTR. Although EPA has not quantified all of the VOC reduction measures described above, EPA believes the conclusion
also applies for VOC, at least in and near the urban portions of the OTR.

iii. Determination Whether Reductions from OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Approach to New Motor Vehicles Are Necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the foregoing information supports the conclusion that sufficient options to make up the shortfall
in emissions reductions necessary for attainment in the OTR are not available from sources other than new motor vehicles,
and that additional reductions in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions from new motor vehicles are therefore necessary. EPA believes that the OTC LEV program would achieve
reductions beyond the mandated Clean Air Act measures by 2005 of 4% for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

These calculations are based on the incremental effect of the LEV program beginning in 1999 throughout the OTR over
the reductions that will take place in New York and Massachusetts as a result of their existing LEV programs beginning
in 1996. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program and the time required for fleet turnover, the maximum benefit
for LEV would not be realized until 2028. Therefore, EPA expects that emissions reductions attributable to an OTC
LEV program would continue to grow after 2005. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the OTC LEV program, some increases in emissions would be associated with the permanent migration of non-LEVs
into the OTR, and with temporary visits by non-LEV vehicles from other states. The amount of excess emissions associated
with migrating and visiting vehicles is dependent on two factors: (1) the difference in emissions per car between
the cars entering the OTR and the ``native'' fleet within the OTR; and (2) the number and age-mix of the cars entering
the OTR from outside. Both questions are difficult to answer and will have different answers for permanent migration
and temporary visitation. The numbers in this Table 4 do not include these effects because EPA is still analyzing this
issue and has not yet quantified these effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When this analysis is ready, EPA will put it in the docket and publish a notice of data availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, EPA does not believe other practicable options are available to make up the shortfall to achieve
the reductions necessary in the OTR for attainment. Therefore, EPA believes that a program available to achieve more
reductions from new motor vehicles is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legal limitations make the LEV program the only option available to the states to achieve what are necessary additional
reductions from new motor vehicles. Section 209 of the Act prohibits states from adopting or attempting to enforce
any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or engines, except for California if a waiver
is granted. This is subject to a limited exception provided in section 177 for states that have SIP provisions approved
under part D of the Act to adopt and enforce emissions standards for new motor vehicles and engines if: (1) Such standards
are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted; and (2) California and the state adopt
the standards at least two years before the beginning of the model year in which the standards are to apply. EPA has granted
a waiver for the California LEV standards, and the states can therefore adopt them.

 At the same time, section 202(b)(1)(C) explicitly prohibits EPA from changing the current ``Tier 1'' emissions standards
for new motor vehicles in sections 202(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h), and (i) before model year 2004.

Therefore, no options other than the LEV program are currently available to achieve the necessary additional reductions
from new motor vehicles and engines. As explained in section V of this notice, EPA is proposing to allow for the possibility
that an alternative federal program achieving comparable emissions reductions to the OTC LEV program may be developed.
But the possibility that such an alternative program can be developed in the future does not contradict the conclusion
that the only option currently available to the states to achieve the required reductions in new motor vehicle emissions
(the LEV program) is necessary.

 In addition, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB or the Board) initially approved its LEV regulations in
1990, it directed CARB to report biennially to the Board on the status of implementation of the regulations. The staff
provided the Board with the first such report at a June 11, 1992 public meeting. At the time the Board found that the low-emission
vehicle standards continued to be technologically feasible within the required time frames, and accordingly no
changes to the standards or phase-in schedule were needed.

See letter from Executive Officer James Boyd to EPA Administrator Carol Browner (July 21, 1994). The Board and staff
did recognize that a variety of amendments would be appropriate to augment the LEV regulations, make them clearer,
and facilitate their implementation. This recognition led to the adoption of several LEV ``follow-up'' amendments,
which were formally adopted by the Board. On September 22, 1993, CARB sent a letter requesting that EPA confirm the
Board's determination that these amendments fall within the scope of the January 8, 1993 waiver for the California

To determine emission reduction equivalency, alternatives must be compared to the emission reduction potential
of the OTC LEV recommendation with respect to the primary ozone precursors. This means that the OTC will assess non-methane
organic gases (NMOG) exhaust emissions, NMOG evaporative emissions, and exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

the scope of the Agency's authority under Section 184 which pertains solely to ozone pollution and its precursors.

 emissions benefits of the ZEV sales requirement without selling ZEV's, they would have to provide a mix of vehicles
subject to requirements in addition to the NMOG fleet average achievement. Under the ZEV equivalency approach, states
could provide the auto manufacturers the option of either complying with the ZEV sales requirement or selling a mix
of other vehicles, which could include some ZEVs, that satisfies both the NMOG requirements and also achieves the
additional benefits equivalent to those that would result from meeting the full ZEV sales requirement. This approach
raises a number of questions on which EPA is soliciting comment: (1) What emission reductions are attributable to
the ZEV sales mandate that would not be realized if only the NMOG fleet average part of the program were adopted? (2)
How would auto manufacturers demonstrate that their mix of vehicles achieved the same total emissions reductions
as the NMOG average plus the ZEV sales mandate? (3) Would such a demonstration require EPA or the states to set a new emission
standard or a sales mandate for non-ZEV vehicles?

EPA requests comment on a number of other issues pertaining to such a ``ZEV equivalency'' requirement, and whether
the Agency should include such a requirement in the final rule. First, EPA requests comment on whether the OTC's recommendation
can be interpreted to include a requirement that the states' programs achieve the benefits of the ZEV sales requirement
in addition to the remainder of the recommended LEV program from the new vehicle sector. EPA also requests comment
on whether the August 4 letter from the Chair of the OTC supports this interpretation, and the extent to which EPA may
rely on such a letter to determine the intent of the OTC's February 10 recommendation.

EPA believes that its analysis of the contribution from one area to another in the OTR should be understood in the specific
context of the OTC LEV program in question here. EPA believes that several aspects of this particular program further
support EPA's conclusion that it is necessary to adopt this program region-wide to counteract ozone transport. Many
parties have commented that the OTC LEV program should apply on a region-wide basis in order to attain the greatest
amount of emissions reductions and facilitate operation of the LEV program.

First, new car sales are very much an interstate business, particularly in the northeast where many smaller states
are located together. Consumers frequently travel throughout a particular state and to different states to buy cars.
To the extent consumers in the more polluted nonattainment areas can continue to buy cars elsewhere in the same state
or in other states, then it is especially important that the cars they buy elsewhere meet the strictest emissions standards
needed for emissions reductions in the more polluted areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interstate business aspect is especially true in border areas of larger states, and can pervade smaller states,
such as those in the OTR. For example, according to auto dealers in Greenwich, Connecticut, fifty percent of their
sales are to New York residents. Dealers in different states regularly trade vehicles among themselves. Dealers
also engage in ``drop shipments,'' where a dealer accepts an order from an out-of-state customer and the vehicle is
shipped directly to the customer without ever physically entering the dealer's inventory. To accommodate such practices,
EPA has adopted a ``cross-border sales'' policy that in effect permits the sale of cars certified to California standards
in states that are contiguous to those that have adopted California standards.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, members of Congress from Maine have urged EPA to extend this cross-border sales policy to dealers in Maine
because they claim that 125 out of 170 Maine dealers rely on vehicle trades with Massachusetts dealers. While they
explained that those in southern Maine are most affected, even dealers as far north as Bangor trade with Massachusetts
dealers.

It is important that the states adopt OTC LEV as soon as possible because the air quality benefits from the program will
not be realized immediately. This delay in air quality benefits is due to the leadtime requirement in section 177 and
the time required for fleet turnover. For the California standards to apply in another state, section 177 of the Act
requires that California and the adopting state adopt the standards at least two years before commencement of the
model year in which the LEV standards are to apply. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program and the time required
for fleet turnover, the maximum benefit for LEV would not be realized until 2028.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also very important that the emissions sources in question here are mobile. Residents of particular states drive
their cars into other states, and may even relocate to such other states. This may be particularly true in the northeast,
where there is a high concentration of large metropolitan areas and a very dense transportation infrastructure that
allows people to drive into and between these big cities. For this reason, it makes particular sense to ensure to the
maximum extent possible that the fleet of cars throughout the region meet the strictest emissions standards needed
for emission reductions in the more polluted areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these business and environmental reasons, industry and government organizations, including auto dealers and
states, have urged that if the program is to be adopted, all states in the region should do so.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Requiring that different cars meeting LEV standards be sold in different parts of the same state, in a potential patchwork
across the region, could create business difficulties and could also compromise the intended environmental benefits
of the program. Indeed, congressional debate over the adoption of section 177 reflected this concern.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Presumably due to these concerns, a number of states in the OTR have actually adopted legislative authority or actual
regulations to implement the LEV program under section 177 that would go into effect on the condition that some number
of other neighboring states in the region likewise implement the program.

Finally, EPA believes that its action in approving state volatility controls as necessary under section 211(c)(4)(C)
constitutes a precedent for considering business practices to conclude that the program should apply state-wide,
even if it may not have been environmentally necessary in that case across the entire state. In that case, EPA approved
New York's adoption of volatility controls as necessary throughout New York, even in areas that were in attainment
for ozone, in part based on the fact that the pipeline distribution network for gasoline made the supply of different
gasoline to different parts of the state difficult for business and for program administration. Therefore, EPA concluded
that the need for the program in part of the state justified allowing New York to adopt it state-wide under section 211(c)(4)(C).

EPA is not now proposing that Virginia adopt the OTC LEV program state-wide, but requests comment on this issue. Congress
designated only the northern portion of Virginia that is part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as part of
the OTR. Therefore, Congress clearly intended that Northern Virginia can be treated separately from the remainder
of Virginia for the purposes of ozone transport, and that pollution control in northern Virginia is particularly
important for attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the northeast. Also, there has been no motion under section 176A to extend
the OTR to the rest of Virginia on grounds that the rest of the state contributes significantly to nonattainment in
the region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, certain commenters questioned a state's authority to adopt California standards in part of a state. Though
EPA disagrees with such comments, as discussed below, EPA requests comment on whether its final action should require
Virginia to adopt the OTC LEV program state-wide. While EPA believes that there is good reason generally for the program
to apply state-wide and region-wide in the OTR, EPA does not believe that state-wide application is legally required
under section 177. Section 177 was clearly designed to deal with nonattainment of standards. This is consistent with
the heading for section 177: ``New Motor Vehicle Standards in Nonattainment Areas.''

 Section 177 does not require statewide implementation of California standards; nor do any of the explicit requirements
of section 177 imply a requirement for statewide implementation. Section 177 merely requires that the state adopt
standards that are identical to the California standards. EPA believes it is most reasonable to interpret the geographical
area in which the standards apply to be a part of the California program that is not an aspect of the term ``standards''
in section 177(l). Of course, other states applying the California standards will necessarily apply them in a variety
of places different from California. And the underlying rationale for the identicality requirement that other states
not adopt standards creating a ``third vehicle'' is not implicated by limitation of the program to part of a state.

(e) Conclusions regarding need for OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) for purposes of attainment by the dates provided in
subpart 2 of part D of title I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's approach has been to analyze the reductions needed in the OTR for purposes of attainment, and then the options
available to achieve those needed reductions. As discussed above, EPA believes that a 50% to 75% reduction in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions throughout the OTR and VOC emissions in and near the urban areas will be necessary for attainment throughout
the OTR. This range is based on studies that used a 1985 emissions baseline. Updated inventory information indicates
that the 1985 inventory underestimated actual emissions. Therefore, EPA believes at least 50% to 75% emissions reductions,
and possibly more, are needed from the 1990 emissions baseline. EPA's modeling analysis has focused generally on
the inventory in the year 2005. As discussed in section IV.A.2.(a), the percentage reductions necessary from the
1990 baseline for purposes of attainment do not change over time and do not depend on EPA's choice of 2005 for purposes
of modeling. Still, control options for achieving those reductions by a particular time can vary, if it takes time
for certain measures to be developed or to be implemented and to achieve reductions. Also, the growth that states must
counteract in order to achieve the percentage reductions from the 1990 baseline will continue to rise over time. EPA's
conclusion that the OTC LEV program is necessary for attainment in the OTR applies for all of the serious and severe
areas with attainment deadlines of 1999, 2005 and 2007. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the analysis focusing on the 2005 inventory, EPA believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is
necessary for the severe nonattainment areas in the OTR to attain by the 2005 deadline. EPA believes there is no basis
to find that its conclusion that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary would be different for emissions
that contribute to nonattainment in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut severe area, which has a 2007 attainment
deadline. The control options EPA assessed will not achieve such greater reductions in the extra two years so as to
make up the shortfall in reductions needed for attainment without the LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, it is important to note that each of the states in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut nonattainment area needs
the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program in order for the other two to reach attainment by 2007. These three states are
part of a common airshed and represent a single area in which pollutants from VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions mix to form a plume of high ozone concentrations. In addition, there is considerable interstate travel
by commuters between these states within this nonattainment area such that non-LEV vehicles from one state would
reduce the effectiveness of a LEV program in the adjacent states. For similar reasons, these states may also need the
LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program in order that the southern New Jersey-Philadelphia nonattainment area (that abuts
the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area) may attain by 2005.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA further believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is needed in the OTR in order for serious areas with
a 1999 attainment deadline to attain on time. Such areas, including the northern serious areas downwind of the New
York-New Jersey-Connecticut area and western/northwestern New England, face a need for tremendous reductions
on a very fast track in order to attain by 1999. Since EPA believes that other reasonable and practicable options are
not available to achieve the entire shortfall in emissions reductions necessary for timely attainment, even the
limited reductions that the OTC LEV program would achieve in model year 1999 are actually necessary. And the program
is not impracticable or unreasonable for this purpose, since the costs in 1999 will be limited in proportion to the
limited vehicles that will meet the standards during that first model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, EPA believes the manner in which areas actually demonstrate that they ultimately achieve attainment further
supports the conclusion that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the serious areas to attain
by 1999. According to EPA guidance, attainment is reached when an area experiences no more than three exceedances
of the ozone NAAQS over a three-year period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
62
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In other words, air quality that results in no more than one exceedance of the NAAQS per year averaged over three years
will be sufficient for attainment, and three years of such data are necessary to demonstrate that the state has achieved
such air quality.

This is assuming the area has complete ozone monitoring data. An adjustment is specified in the ozone NAAQS to account
for missing data. Where data are incomplete, the number of exceedances that would be expected had the data been complete
is calculated to determine the attainment status of the area; See 40 CFR 50.9 as interpreted by Appendix H; ``State

The Clean Air Act attainment requirements take into account that states may not be able to achieve air quality improvements
two years prior to the attainment year deadline in order to be able to show attainment over a three-year period ending
by that deadline year. Under section 181(a)(5) of the Act, a state may apply to EPA for a one-year extension of the attainment
deadline specified in section 181 if the state has complied with all SIP requirements and the area in question has experienced
no more than one exceedance of the ozone NAAQS during the deadline year, containing the attainment date. EPA may grant
up to two one-year extensions under this provision. Of course, in order to achieve the NAAQS and be eligible for redesignation
to attainment, the states must sustain the air quality improvements achieved in order to have not more than one exceedance
for each of the two extension years, and are likely to have to control growth in emissions in order to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Serious areas in the OTR may need to rely on extensions of the attainment deadline under section 181(a)(5) in order
to avoid a finding of failure to attain (and the consequent ``bump-up'' to a severe classification with a 2005 attainment
date).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
63
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA believes it is highly likely, in such a case, that OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) will be necessary to achieve reductions
in order to offset growth and sustain attainment-level air quality through the 2000 and 2001 extension years. OTC
LEV would generate increasing reductions in those years, due to fleet turnover.

In sum, since OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) is necessary to bring serious and severe areas stretching from Washington,
DC to Portsmouth, New Hampshire into attainment by the 1999, 2005, and 2007 deadlines applicable to those areas, and
because the reductions from OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) will be needed in areas located in a broad area extending from
the south through the northwest of each of those areas and nearby locations from which vehicles may travel and be traded,
EPA proposes to conclude that OTC LEV is necessary throughout the OTR to bring those areas into attainment by those
dates.

3. Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program for Purposes of Maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Legal Relevance of Maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA discussed the timing of reductions from the OTC LEV program and the relevance of maintenance to its inquiry at length
in the April 26 proposal. See 59 FR 21728&hyph;21730. The program would not achieve substantial reductions until
after its first implementation in model year 1999. There is much evidence that the nonattainment problem in the severe
areas is a regional problem in origin, and that the OTC LEV program is therefore needed throughout much of the region
to prevent contribution to nonattainment in the severe areas. In addition, however, EPA believes that the states
in the OTR need the program to avoid interference with downwind maintenance of the NAAQS even after it is achieved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA believes it should consider this maintenance need here, it must have legal authority to do so. In the April
26 notice, EPA raised this issue because the language in section 184(c) describing the basis for an OTC recommendation,
EPA's obligation in reviewing it, and EPA's obligation to explain why any control measure is not necessary all reference
necessity ``to bring an area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart'' and omit any reference
to maintenance. Nevertheless, EPA currently believes that it has legal authority to consider maintenance under
section 184, and in any case has independent authority for the action proposed here on maintenance grounds directly
under sections 110(k)(5) and 110(a)(2)(D). EPA believes that these sections of the Act, together with the overall
structure of title I, support this conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be sure, other provisions of the Act explicitly distinguish between ``attainment'' and ``maintenance.'' Beginning
with the overall goal of healthful ambient air quality, section 109(b) requires EPA to issue ambient air quality standards
``the attainment and maintenance of which'' are necessary to protect the public health or welfare. The current statutory
structure as revised in the 1990 Amendments, however, reflects a difference between the manner in which Congress
addressed states' attainment and maintenance obligations with respect to their own independent air quality and
the manner in which Congress addressed states' obligations to prevent contribution to downwind nonattainment and
interference with downwind maintenance. In sum, EPA believes that this new structure establishes particular time-frames
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states to address attainment separately from maintenance to protect their own air quality, but left much greater
discretion for EPA to insist that states address these concerns at all times when states' emissions cause harm in other
states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Prior to 1990, initial SIPs due nine months after EPA promulgation of a NAAQS were to include programs designed both
to attain and thereafter maintain the standards. See prior section 110(a)(2) (B) and (D) and section 172(a). In 1990,
for areas designated as nonattainment areas, Congress specified requirements for attainment and maintenance in
discrete provisions that provide for discrete SIP submissions to address these two separable concerns. Section
172 continues to require submission of a SIP providing for the attainment of the NAAQS in nonattainment areas. The
subpart 2 ozone program specifies deadlines for submission of a variety of SIP revisions, including attainment demonstrations
for moderate and above areas. Maintenance considerations for nonattainment areas were specifically relocated
to a new section 175A, which provides that states are to submit plans, including additional control measures, as necessary
to ensure maintenance for at least 10 years following redesignation to attainment. See section 175A(a). Significantly,
section 175A includes no requirement that a state adopt measures to address transport of pollutants that may interfere
with maintenance downwind.

One might assume that an area that is in attainment and maintains that status could not interfere with attainment or
maintenance downwind. Intuitively, one might not expect a ``clean air'' area to cause other areas to have ``dirty
air.'' But this is not the case. Areas that meet the standard may nonetheless have emissions that interfere with attainment
or maintenance downwind. Indeed, Congress's decision to require control measures such as RACT and nonattainment
new source review even in attainment areas throughout the OTR under section 184(b) indicates Congress understood
that ``clean air'' areas could contribute to ``dirty air'' downwind.

Consistent with this new structure, Congress changed the requirement formerly codified at section 110(a)(2)(D)
that required SIPs to include a permit program for stationary sources as necessary to assure that NAAQS ``are achieved
and maintained.'' The new section 110(a)(2)(C) simply requires regulation of stationary sources as necessary to
assure that NAAQS ``are achieved.'' Thus, it appears that Congress specifically deleted references to maintenance
in section 110(a)(2) where it believed that to be appropriate in light of the new structure and new section 175A.

Congress did leave a reference in section 110(a)(2)(C) to ``a permit program as required in parts C and D.'' The part
C permit program codified at section 165 of the Act is designed to prevent significant deterioration of air quality
in attainment areas, and hence would only be relevant to maintenance, not achieving attainment. One might argue from
this that Congress intended the reference to attainment in section 110(a)(2)(C) to include maintenance, as well.
But, the better view may be that Congress simply overlooked the need to delete the reference to part C in light of its
specific deletion of the reference to maintenance.

However, Congress made no such change to the pollution transport provisions of section 110(a)(2). The transport
provision was significantly broadened from the former section 110(a)(2)(E) to new section 110(a)(2)(D), as discussed
above. Nonetheless, in changing the language of the transport provision, Congress saw fit to retain the reference
to maintenance. Indeed, Congress had to specifically focus on this issue when it changed the standard from ``prevent[s]
attainment or maintenance'' in the former provision to ``contributes significantly'' to nonattainment and ``interfere[s]
with maintenance'' in the new provision. This indicates Congress specifically sought to retain maintenance as a
criterion for pollution transport under section 110(a)(2) at the same time it was deleting maintenance as a criterion
for the permit provisions in light of section 175A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes this structure is consistent with the absence of any requirement that maintenance plans under section
175A address pollution transport. Thus, the only provision in the Act that requires states to prevent emissions within
their borders that interfere with maintenance in another state downwind is section 110(a)(2)(D). This may be particularly
important due to the staggered attainment deadlines under section 181 for ozone. As is the case in the northeast, severe
areas with longer attainment deadlines may be located upwind of less polluted nonattainment areas with shorter attainment
deadlines. Even if the downwind areas can attain on time, the upwind areas may continue to generate substantial emissions
interfering with downwind maintenance until or even beyond the upwind area's longer attainment deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed generally above, EPA believes it has authority to act under section 110(k)(5) at any time, even prior
to submission of attainment demonstrations under section 182, to require submission of measures EPA believes are
necessary for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D). See 59 FR at 21730 (explaining EPA's independent basis to issue
SIP call under section 110(k)(5) to adopt measures necessary for compliance with maintenance aspect of section 110(a)(2)(D)).
It is especially important that EPA act now, because the LEV program depends on vehicle fleet turnover that will take
an unusually long time to generate the needed emissions reductions. If EPA waits for the states to develop their attainment
plans, and where applicable, their maintenance plans, the opportunity to ensure that necessary emissions reductions
from the LEV program are achieved beginning in 1999 and growing thereafter may be irrevocably lost. Any delay in beginning
the fleet turnover to LEV vehicles in model year 1999 will diminish the emissions benefits in the years following.
It is therefore necessary for the states to act now to adopt OTC LEV and appropriate for EPA to make a finding of substantial
inadequacy now with respect to that program for the purposes of maintenance. For the same reasons discussed generally
above, EPA believes an environmentally conservative approach to evaluating the need for the LEV program to avoid
interference with maintenance is warranted here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that maintenance is a proper consideration under section 184(c), too. To be sure, that provision references
timely attainment and omits maintenance. However, section 184(c)(5) provides for an EPA finding of substantial
inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) that states' SIPs do not meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), which
specifically prohibits emissions in states from interfering with maintenance in downwind states. Moreover, EPA
believes there is an adequate basis to reasonably interpret section 184(c) to include maintenance. Specifically,
EPA believes that it should understand ``attainment'' to include ``maintenance'' where the issue is whether measures
are ``necessary'' to comply with pollution transport requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The very emphasis on the ``necessary'' standard under section 184 supports this conclusion. In contrast, EPA's recent
determination that ``attainment'' under section 182(f) does not include maintenance involved a different standard.
There, EPA's Conformity General Preamble explained that the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

EPA stated that Congress could reasonably have believed it appropriate to require states to impose specified requirements
on NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources for areas in nonattainment, but that states might decide for themselves whether to impose such controls for
maintenance purposes, even if such controls would ``contribute'' to maintenance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA noted, however, that this distinction might not apply where the test is whether control measures are ``necessary''
for attainment and maintenance is not referenced, as here. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where measures are ``necessary'' for maintenance, EPA does not believe it makes sense to let states decide for themselves
whether to adopt the measures. Inherent in the ``necessary'' determination under section 184 is the conclusion that
the states really have no choice: They need to adopt the measure in order to avoid interfering with downwind maintenance.
Unlike the section 182(f) ``contributes'' context, as long as EPA determines that it is necessary, there really is
no choice. It seems less reasonable to believe Congress intended that section 184 would not reach a measure in fact
necessary for maintenance, when the result of a failure to implement the measure would therefore be downwind areas'
relapse into nonattainment, perhaps shortly after the attainment dates in subpart 2. Where the necessary standard
applies in the interstate pollution context, EPA believes it is sensible to understand ``attainment'' to include
``maintenance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA believes its discussion of section 176A in its April 26 proposal identifies an additional statutory
basis to support this sensible conclusion. That is, the OTR in section 184 is established under section 184(a) ``within
the meaning of section 176A(a).'' Section 176A authorizes a transport commission under that provision to ``[r]ecommend
to the Administrator such measures as the Commission determines to be necessary to ensure that the plans for the relevant
states meet the requirements of section [110(a)(2)(D)].'' This presumably includes both the attainment and maintenance
aspects of section 110(a)(2)(D). In all other respects, EPA's obligations in response to a transport commission
under section 176A are less strict than under section 184. It would therefore be odd if section 176A required EPA to
consider maintenance in response to a commission's recommendations, but that EPA would not be required to do so under
section 184. This is particularly so since it seems foolhardy to consider measures necessary for attainment at the
exclusion of those necessary for maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it seems reasonable to interpret the OTC under section 184 as a creature of both sections 184 and 176A. Section
184 simply adds stringency to EPA's obligations in responding to recommendations from the OTC, since Congress specifically
identified the serious transport problem between the many northeast states as surely deserving the attention of
such a regional commission. Thus, it makes sense to believe that Congress intended the particular dates in section
184 to highlight the specific deadlines in the subpart 2 ozone program that the OTC is specifically charged with addressing.
But in so doing it does not seem as reasonable to believe that Congress intended to displace the more general authority
of a commission under section 176A to make recommendations concerning the maintenance aspects of section 110(a)(2)(D).
Thus, EPA believes it is most reasonable to understand the references in section 184(c) to attainment to include maintenance
through section 176A, as well. Even if operating under sections 176A, 110(k)(5), and 110(a)(2)(D) directly, EPA
believes it may issue a SIP call at this time under section 110(k)(5) requiring states to adopt the OTC LEV program as
necessary to avoid interfering with maintenance in other states.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Technical Analysis of Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program for Maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the OTC LEV program is necessary for all of the nonattainment areas to maintain the ozone NAAQS, even
after they attain. This is because EPA's modeling analysis projects very high rates of growth in emissions in the OTR
that must continue to be neutralized even after controls sufficient for attainment by the attainment deadlines are
in place. Based on EPA's analysis discussed in sections II.A.(a), (b) and (c), the Agency does not believe that other
available control options are sufficient to attain without OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent). Since EPA is not aware of
sufficient additional control options to counteract growth following attainment, EPA believes, a fortiori, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that OTC LEV will be necessary for these areas to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS over two consecutive ten-year
periods following redesignation (as required by section 175A of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not only does EPA believe that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for the nonattainment areas in
the OTR to maintain the ozone NAAQS, but EPA believes that this program will play an increasingly important role in
counteracting growth over the maintenance periods. Of course, implementation of the program in model year 1999 will
not begin to play a role until well into the maintenance periods for the marginal and moderate areas that attain the
standard by 1993 and 1996, respectively. Assuming areas could achieve redesignation in their attainment years,
for the serious and severe areas that have attainment deadlines under section 181 of 1999, 2005, or 2007, the OTC LEV
program will contribute to both attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. Due to the phase-in schedule for the LEV program
and the time it takes for the fleet to completely turnover, the LEV program will continue to accrue additional benefits
through the year 2028. In 2015 (the last year for which EPA has done a projection analysis), emissions reductions due
to the OTC LEV program will be 1200 tons of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 highway vehicle emissions and a 38% reduction in VOC highway vehicle emissions compared to emissions in 2015 without
the OTC LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table presents VMT growth rate information averaged between 1990 and 2005 for mobile source emissions
within the OTR. The table focuses on growth estimates for mobile sources as the most relevant for assessing the impact
of LEV in the OTR, since LEV affects emissions from this source category. These growth rates are derived from the EPA's
MOBILE5 Fuel Consumption model, and are taken from a study prepared under EPA contract.

Emissions rates for mobile sources are calculated by multiplying emissions factors developed for the fleet by projected
activity levels, characterized as projected vehicle miles travelled (VMT). Growth in VMT tends to neutralize the
downward trend in emissions factors resulting from turnover in the fleet to vehicles meeting federal tier 1 standards,
and implementation of advanced inspection/maintenance programs. As the vehicle fleet turns over, fewer old cars
with less advanced technology will remain on the road, and the downward trend in emissions factors will slow over time.
Therefore, EPA expects that growth in VMT will overtake current programs to increase growth rates more and more over
time beyond the 1990&hyph;2005 time frame in the table. Of course, the OTC LEV program would be helpful in increasing
and extending the downward trend in emissions factors to offset growth in VMT and counteract overall emissions growth.

4. Relevance of EPA Transport Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA discussed in its April 26 proposal, EPA is developing a policy to address the particular problem where overwhelming
transport from upwind areas with later attainment dates is such a dominant factor accounting for nonattainment in
a downwind area with an earlier attainment date that the downwind areas will not be able to attain by the deadline. See
59 FR at 21728&hyph;29. This problem was specifically raised in the OTR for areas in Massachusetts in letters from
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Conservation Law Foundation.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, one solution is for the responsible upwind areas to relieve their overwhelming contribution so that the
downwind areas may attain by the specified year. But, as EPA described in its April 26 proposal, in certain cases this
could be at odds with the overall title I scheme that establishes later deadlines for attainment in more polluted areas
and also establishes a graduated program of additional and more stringent requirements to be accomplished over the
longer time-frame. It might be appropriate for EPA to interpret the Act so that, if it is impracticable to accelerate
controls in the upwind areas and other facts are shown, then the downwind areas might have additional time to reach
attainment beyond the section 181(a)(1) dates.

Since EPA's April 26 proposal, EPA staff has continued to work with a group of officials from states across the country
that are likely to be affected, including officials from Massachusetts, Maine, and other states to develop a policy
to address this problem. This policy, described in a September 1, 1994 memorandum from Mary D. Nichols, Assistant
Administrator, to EPA regional offices, provides that states seeking to have the Clean Air Act interpreted so as to
allow them a later attainment deadline would have to make certain showings including a showing of overwhelming transport.

EPA does not expect that the states will be able to complete such analyses and have EPA make a determination by the time
EPA takes final action on the OTC recommendation. Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that pervasive transport in the OTR
underlies the creation of the OTC and the basis for EPA's proposed approval of the OTC LEV recommendation. EPA expects
that, on this basis, a few areas in the OTR are likely candidates to make valid demonstrations that the Act should be
interpreted to allow them more time to attain because overwhelming transport from upwind areas with later attainment
deadlines will unavoidably prevent earlier attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this has not yet occurred, EPA can anticipate the implications here if it does. If downwind areas ultimately
are subject to later attainment deadlines than are currently believed to pertain, then emissions reductions during
the ``extension period'' would apply to reaching attainment rather than to maintenance of the NAAQS after attainment.
To the extent EPA currently believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is necessary for maintenance in
such areas after the section 181(a)(1) attainment year (and through any ``extension period''), then such reductions
likewise would be necessary for attainment if EPA grants that such areas have the ``extension period'' to attain.
EPA does now believe that areas in the OTR will need the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program to maintain the NAAQS in
the years after the section 181(a)(1) deadlines. EPA therefore expects that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program
will ultimately be necessary in those years for such areas that may have longer under the forthcoming transport policy
to actually attain the NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, even if attainment dates are not extended pursuant to a transport policy, EPA believes that it may conclude
that certain serious areas in the OTR will not be able to reach attainment by 1999, nor to qualify for the one-year extensions
described earlier. Such areas would then be subject to ``bump up'' under section 181(b)(2) of the Act and would have
until 2005 (or, if sooner, as expeditiously as practicable) to attain. EPA believes that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent)
program will ultimately be necessary to achieve reductions in the period after 1999 for any such areas to attain.

Section 184 requires that in reviewing the recommendation of the OTC, EPA must evaluate whether the additional control
measures are ``otherwise consistent with this [Act].'' In general, states, with the exception of California, are
prohibited under section 209(a) of the Act from regulating emissions from new motor vehicles. However, section 177
of the Act provides an exception from this prohibition that allows a state which has plan provisions approved under
part D of title I of the Act to adopt California's standards relating to control of emissions from new motor vehicles
and to take other actions otherwise prohibited under section 209(a) if_

create, or have the effect of creating, a motor vehicle or engine different than a motor vehicle or engine certified

Section 177 of the Act provides the only exception in the Act from preemption of state standards for control of emissions
from new motor vehicles under section 209(a). The control measures recommended by the OTC must therefore be consistent
with section 177. EPA noted in the NPRM that four aspects of the OTC recommendation may implicate section 177 of the
Act. See 59 FR 21735. First, the OTC recommends that EPA require use of California LEVs but specifically states that
adoption of California reformulated gasoline is not a part of the recommendation. Second, the recommendation does
not require inclusion of the ZEV sales requirement in any state regulations except to the extent the sales requirement
is required under section 177. Third, EPA noted that the recommendation did not explicitly incorporate California's
regulations. Instead, the recommendation merely stated that the OTC recommended adoption of a low emission vehicle
program that includes certain elements detailed in the recommendation, pursuant to the requirements of section
177. EPA also noted that the OTC recommended incorporation of California's fleet NMOG standards and that some commenters
believed incorporation of the NMOG standards was inconsistent with section 177. Finally, EPA requested comments
regarding whether section 177 allows a state to adopt a California vehicle program in a portion of the state, rather
than the entire state. This final point is not addressed in this section of the preamble, but is addressed in section
IV.A.2.(c)iii., above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the publication of the first NPRM, EPA has received comments indicating that other aspects of the OTC's recommendation
may violate section 177. One commenter asserted that a state's incorporation of the California LEV program after
the program is initiated in California may create a ``third vehicle'' because of the operation of California's emissions
credit banking regulations. Also, a commenter questioned whether a state without a current nonattainment area or
an approved state implementation plan can impose the California LEV requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA today proposes to find that the OTC's recommendation for EPA to require implementation of the OTC LEV program throughout
the OTR is consistent with section 177. Moreover, EPA proposes to find that implementation of the ZEV sales requirement
is not necessary in order for the recommendation to be consistent with section 177. Therefore, EPA proposes not to
require that states in the OTR adopt the ZEV sales requirement. Individual states may, at their discretion, incorporate
the ZEV sales requirements into their programs.

EPA proposes to find that the OTC's failure to include California's clean fuel requirements in its recommendation

violate the requirement of section 177 that standards must be ``identical to the California standards for which a
waiver has been granted for such model year.'' EPA also believes that the lack of California fuel requirements does
not violate the ``third car prohibition'' of section 177.

California's clean fuel provisions were not part of California's waiver application under section 209. In fact,
state standards that are related to fuel as opposed to emissions of motor vehicles, are not even governed by section
209(a). State fuel provisions are addressed separately in section 211 of the Act, which provides a substantially
different regime for state fuel standards. Under section 211, states may regulate fuels if they can demonstrate to
EPA that such regulation is necessary to meet federal air quality standards, except that California may regulate
fuel without such a demonstration. Therefore, as California has not asked for a waiver for its fuel regulations, nor
is it required to do so under the Act, such standards are not ``standards *&blank;*&blank;* for which a waiver has been
granted'' and thus are not subject to the identicality provisions of section 177. Were the Agency to find that states
must also adopt California's fuel standards to meet the section 177 identicality requirements, then every state
wishing to adopt California's motor vehicle standards would be required to meet not only the requirements of section
177 but also the requirements of section 211, so that it could simultaneously adopt associated fuel controls. EPA
believes that this would be an incorrect interpretation of the Act, given the structure of the Act and its explicit
differentiation between vehicle and fuel requirements. For the reasons provided in this notice and outlined by EPA
in its amicus curiae briefs and by the courts in the New York and Massachusetts cases, EPA proposes to find that no conflict
with section 177 exists on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Third Vehicle Prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also proposes to find that the lack of a clean fuel requirement does not violate the ``third vehicle'' prohibition
of section 177. Manufacturers claim that the difference in sulfur levels between the fuels sold in California and
the northeast would cause deleterious effects on emission control systems on California LEV vehicles, which would
require certain design changes to manage these effects. This, they claim, would require them to manufacture vehicles
for the OTR that would differ from the vehicles they expect to sell for California, and would thus violate section 177's
``third vehicle'' prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturers' arguments fail on several grounds. First, nothing in the OTC recommendation requires any manufacturer
to produce any vehicle different from a California certified vehicle. In fact, the OTC recommendation would require
that any new car sold in the OTR be a California-certified vehicle. Manufacturers are free to sell cars in the OTC that
are identical to those sold in California. Any design changes made by manufacturers would result from a manufacturer's
voluntary decision to effect such a change. There is no third vehicle violation where a manufacturer voluntarily
decides to sell a third vehicle in a state other than California. The court of appeals in the New York case, responding
to a similar ``third car'' challenge by manufacturers regarding ZEVs, found that whatever design change ``the manufacturers
choose to install on cars sold in New York is a marketing choice of theirs and not a requirement imposed by the [state].''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the ``third vehicle prohibition'' should not be read to apply to every design change, regardless of its nature
or scope. Section 177 uses the phrase ``third vehicle'' to refer to ``a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine different
than a motor vehicle or engine certified in California under California standards.'' This statutory language indicates
that its meaning is tied to the concept of emission certification, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that ``third vehicle'' should be read to refer to design changes needed to meet certification requirements. This
reading is consistent with the purpose of the third vehicle prohibition, which is to reinforce the identicality requirement
by prohibiting a state from administering standards identical to California's in a way that actually requires conformance
to more stringent standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``third vehicle'' itself suggests it should be so limited. It presumes the existence of ``first vehicles''
and ``second vehicles'' (vehicles that meet federal and California standards, respectively). Congress was plainly
aware that ``first vehicles'' include vehicles with widely differing physical characteristics. For example, ``first
vehicles'' include cars both with and without rear-window defrosters. This makes it clear that vehicles may contain
minor differences in design that are unnecessary to meet emission standards without creating ``third vehicles.''
The legislative history of section 177 confirms that the ``third vehicle prohibition'' does not require physical
identicality of vehicles and that design changes would not create a ``third car violation'' unless they create an
``undue burden'' on manufacturers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Though one manufacturer has stated in other proceedings that it may need to use a different converter assembly (one
that is bolted, not welded) on vehicles sold in the OTR, the manufacturers have not provided evidence indicating that
significant design changes creating an ``undue burden'' are required to implement the OTC LEV program without California
fuels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to find today that the ZEV sales requirement is not required to ensure consistency with section 177. Therefore,
as the OTC requested inclusion of the ZEV sales requirement only ``to the extent that a Zero Emission Vehicle sales
requirement must be a component of a LEV program adopted under Section 177,'' EPA proposes to approve the OTC recommendation
without the ZEV sales requirement. Individual states within the OTC may at their option include such a requirement
in the programs they adopt.

The OTC recommendation explicitly recommended that individual states within the OTR be allowed to implement the
ZEV sales mandate if they so choose. EPA believes that incorporation of the ZEV sales mandate into a state's LEV program
is not inconsistent with the requirements of section 177. The court of appeals in the New York case similarly found
that New York's incorporation of the ZEV sales mandate did not violate section 177's prohibition on sales limitations
on California-certified vehicles or section 177's ``third vehicle prohibition.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As EPA discussed in the NPRM, the first question presented by this issue is whether the ZEV sales requirement is a ``standard
relating to control of emissions.'' See 59 FR at 21735. EPA initially determined, in letters sent to New York and Virginia
state officials on January 7, 1993, that the ZEV sales requirement is not a standard, based on the belief that it had
no direct effect on emissions associated with the LEV program, given the existence of the NMOG fleet average requirement.
EPA stated: ``The ZEV sales mandate simply limits the flexibility otherwise accorded manufacturers to choose the
mix of vehicles produced to meet the NMOG fleet average requirement.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, as EPA found that the ZEV sales mandate did not limit the quantity, rate or concentration of NMOG emissions,
EPA stated that the mandate was not an emission standard, but instead was an accompanying enforcement procedure.
In fact, the OTC stated in documents accompanying its recommendation that the ZEV sales mandate is an accompanying
enforcement procedure and is not required by section 177. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, the ZEV sales requirement does not require that overall tailpipe emissions of NMOG from California vehicles
be any lower than they would have been in the absence of the sales requirement. The amount of NMOG tailpipe emissions
produced by such vehicles is controlled by the NMOG fleet average requirement, not the sales mandate. However, current
EPA data indicates that the ZEV sales requirement clearly will have a beneficial effect on emissions of evaporative
hydrocarbons and tailpipe emissions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from vehicles in the LEV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it appears that the determination of whether the ZEV mandate is a ``standard'' must be based on other factors.
An argument that the ZEV sales requirement is not an emission standard would be based on the presumption that ``standards''
are only the numerical limits placed on sources restricting emissions of particular pollutants. This argument is
similar to certain language found in

value setting the quantitative level of permitted emissions of pollutants by a new motor vehicle.''

 at 1111. The court neither adopted this definition nor did it take issue with EPA's definition. The court did state
that the legislative history ``indicates that Congress intended the word `standards' to mean quantitative levels
of emissions rather than regulations involving certification or in-use maintenance restrictions'' (emphasis
added).

 was later overruled legislatively twice by Congress. Congress first revised section 112 in 1978 and Congress then
revised section 302 in 1990 to ensure that EPA used a more expansive definition of ``emission standard.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this approach has some disadvantages. First, it divorces the term ``emission standard'' from actual emission
reductions. Without a mandate to sell cleaner cars, there is no enforceable benefit to having numerical emission
``standards'' for those cars. In addition, it can be argued that sales requirements do ``relate to the control of emissions
from new motor vehicles.'' Moreover, such a determination may have implications for other requirements in the LEV
program and other programs, particularly requirements that include averaging, banking and trading, requirements
that include fleet averaging, and requirements where a phase-in is used. (If a phase-in is not a standard, could a state
require 0% (or 100%) compliance, instead of partial compliance, with a standard being phased in over time?) Moreover,
the court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MEMA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stated that the ``only species of emissions control regulation which directly addresses air quality is a standard.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 1113. This language seems consistent with a determination that the term ``standards'' includes sales requirements
because without a sales requirement, a numerical limitation on emissions from a type of vehicle by itself has no effect
on air quality.

Regardless of whether EPA were to find that the ZEV sales requirement is a standard, EPA believes that incorporation
of the sales requirement is not required for the OTC&hyph;LEV program to meet the requirements for identicality under
section 177. Section 177 allows a state to adopt and enforce ``for any model year standards relating to control of emissions
from new motor vehicles and *&blank;*&blank;* engines *&blank;*&blank;* if other such standards are identical
to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that section 177 should not be read to require that once a state has promulgated one California standard
for a particular model, the state must adopt all of California's standards relating to the control of emissions from
all types of motor vehicles for that model year. The language of section 177 does not require adoption of all California
standards for a given model year. Section 177 requires only that if a state adopts motor vehicle standards, such standards
must be identical to California standards. Therefore, the identicality requirement only necessitates that the
specific standards adopted by the state be identical to the comparable California standards. As long as the state
adopts all standards that are necessary to implement a particular California vehicle program,
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 and as long as the state adopts all standards necessitated by the other requirements of section 177 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the state must not prevent a California-certified car from being sold in the state and must not create a ``third car''),
the state need not adopt other standards that are not integral to the particular program being adopted.

EPA believes that all standards applicable to a segregatable program must be implemented in order to assure that specific
vehicles required by a particular program are subject to the same emissions requirements (e.g. a state could not adopt
only California's NMOG standards for a LEV without adopting the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO standards.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, as discussed in the NPRM, EPA believes that adoption of the California LEV program does not require adoption
of the California heavy-duty engine program. Similarly, EPA believes that section 177 does not require a state to
promulgate standards that are clearly segregable from one another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the ZEV sales requirement is clearly segregable from the rest of the LEV program. The LEV program
is essentially comprised of several requirements limiting the quantity of emissions that may be emitted from particular
types of vehicles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 TLEVs, LEVs) and two requirements mandating sales of such vehicles. The first is the NMOG fleet average. The second
is the ZEV sales requirement. Without implementation of either of these mandates, the requirements defining emission
levels for types of vehicles are basically unenforceable because, unlike more traditional motor vehicle emission
programs, the LEV program separates emission levels from mandates to buy vehicles meeting such emission levels.
In other words, a statute defining the levels one must meet for a vehicle to be called a low emission vehicle may have
little enforceable emissions value, unless there is an enforceable requirement to manufacture such a vehicle. The
NMOG fleet average is the central provision of the LEV program to require manufacture of the low emission vehicles
in the program and to obtain enforceable emission reductions from such vehicles. The ZEV sales requirement, on the
other hand, is a technology requirement essentially designed to ensure the manufacture of technology-forcing vehicles.
It is designed to create a new generation of vehicles. As noted previously, however, the ZEV sales mandate also provides

 emissions reduction benefits separate and distinct from the NMOG fleet average requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though the two mandates are complementary, they are not essential for one another. The designs of the vehicles in the
LEV program will be based on the emission levels that manufacturers must meet. The mandates merely tell the manufacturers
how many vehicles of each type must be built. Each mandate creates a fully functional and enforceable motor vehicle
emissions program. Therefore, EPA believes that a LEV program designed to reduce emissions in the northeast that
includes the NMOG fleet average may, but need not, include the ZEV sales requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to request comment on whether state incorporation of the ZEV sales requirement is necessary to satisfy
the identicality requirement of section 177.

4. Incorporation of Minor Provisions of the California LEV Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTC's initial recommendation to EPA does not specifically identify every component of the California LEV program
that it intends to incorporate into the OTC LEV program; nor does the recommendation include proposed regulations.
Instead the recommendation identifies the main elements of the OTC LEV program and the timeframe for the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the implicit intent of the recommendation was incorporation of emission standards that were identical
to the California LEV program and incorporation of all provisions of California's LEV program necessary to ensure
consistency with section 177 for 1999 and later model year passenger cars and light-duty trucks (0&hyph;5750 pounds
loaded vehicle weight). This intent is evidenced by the implicit language of the recommendation. The recommendation
specifically notes that the OTC LEV program is to be applied ``[p]ursuant to the requirements of section 177.'' EPA
believes that the listing of the most important provisions of the California LEV program to be incorporated was not
meant to imply the exclusion of other provisions necessary to ensure consistency with section 177. The recommendation
adopted the OTC LEV program ``including'' the listed provisions, implying that other provisions would also be included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's interpretation of the petition is further supported by the Response to Comments document submitted with the
recommendation (and in the docket), which clearly states, at page 27, that the recommendation has been made consistent
with section 177 and 184 of the Act. The Response to Comments document also notes, at pages 6 and 33, that the provisions
of the recommended program were constrained by section 177's identicality requirement. Another indication that
the OTC clearly intended the program to be consistent with section 177 is the fact that the recommendation requests
incorporation of the ZEV sales requirement only to the extent it is required for consistency. Thus, the OTC was willing
to include this controversial provision if consistency depended on its inclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Executive Director of the OTC, Bruce Carhart, stated explicitly, in an April 15, 1994 letter responding
to an EPA inquiry, that the OTC's ``intention is to maintain identicality with California as required by the Clean
Air Act.'' Mr. Carhart also indicated that the OTC intended to incorporate secondary provisions in California's
LEV program into the OTC LEV program. EPA believes that it is appropriate to use this letter as further evidence of the
intent of the Commission. Where there is ambiguity in the OTC petition, EPA does not believe that its ability to review
the OTC recommendation is limited to examining the explicit language of the recommendation. Certainly, EPA approval
of the recommendation cannot include provisions that were not contemplated by the recommendation and do not naturally
arise from the face of the recommendation. However, where the recommendation is ambiguous regarding a certain point,
EPA believes that, consistent with its requirement to consult with the Commission, it may request clarification
of the OTC petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under &sect;184(c)(3), if EPA must interpret a recommendation in a certain way in order to ensure consistency
with the Act, and such an interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the recommendation, then EPA is constrained
to use that interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, EPA interprets the recommendation to require emission standards identical to California's LEV
standards and to require promulgation of provisions that ensure consistency with section 177.

A commenter notes that the OTC recommendation for the NMOG standard is not consistent with California's NMOG standard
for light-duty trucks 3751&hyph;5750 lbs. This appears to have been an oversight on the part of the OTC. As the letter
from Mr. Carhart shows, the OTC intended separate fleet averages for both classes of light-duty vehicles. Consistent
with the discussion above, EPA interprets the recommendation to recommend NMOG fleet averages identical to California's
NMOG averages for light-duty vehicles 0&hyph;3750 lbs. and for light-duty vehicles 3751&hyph;5750 lbs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not intend at this time to delineate each portion of the California LEV program that is required for satisfaction
of the requirements of section 177. Such determinations will be made in the review of each state plan or in guidance
to be issued by EPA later. However, EPA notes that the April 15 letter from Bruce Carhart stated that the following specific
portions of the program have been included in the OTC recommendation: The NMOG banking and trading provisions, the
relevant exemptions for small and intermediate manufacturers, provisions for hybrid electric vehicles,

 and reactivity adjustment factors as necessary for California certification.

CARB's LEV program provides for the development and use of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as part of the LEV fleet
in California. HEVs are expected to incorporate an electric motor and an auxiliary power unit, such as a combustion
engine, to allow for the efficient operation of the vehicle's propulsion system as well as its other systems, like
lighting. CARB provides for three different classifications of HEVs in its statutory formula used to calculate a
manufacturer's fleet average NMOG value. Additionally, HEVs are tested differently from LEVs. See Title 13, California

5. The NMOG Fleet Average
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the April 26, 1994 NPRM, EPA believes that the OTC's incorporation of the NMOG fleet average does not
violate section 177. Even if the identicality provision of section 177 does not require inclusion of the NMOG fleet
average, manufacturers have provided no clear argument regarding why inclusion of the NMOG average, which is identical
to the NMOG average promulgated by California, violates section 177. Given that identicality with California standards
is a primary goal of section 177, any argument that such an identical provision is forbidden by section 177 is dubious
on its face. Section 177 was designed to provide manufacturers with assurance that they would not be forced to produce
several different types of vehicles to comply with different state emission standards. Manufacturers have provided
no evidence that incorporation of the NMOG fleet average will in any way cause manufacturers to produce different
vehicles than those certified for use in California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, as the Second Circuit articulated in the New York case in the context of the ZEV sales requirement, the fleet
average requirement does not violate the requirement of section 177 that states shall not prohibit the sale of California
cars. While the NMOG average requires that a certain number of lower-emitting vehicles must be sold in a state to assure
compliance, it does not prevent any California-certified car from being sold. Moreover, as the Second Circuit realized,
a finding that the fleet average violated section 177 would in effect nullify section 177 for all practical purposes
with regard to the LEV program and any other program that uses any sort of averaging or other flexible approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it may be appropriate for the states in the OTC to enforce the NMOG fleet average provisions through
a regionwide averaging system. EPA has received comments supporting such an enforcement program. EPA intends to
issue guidance after this recommendation is approved (if it is finally approved) addressing the legal and policy
issues implicated by such a program.

6. Averaging, Banking, and Trading
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter noted that as California's LEV program includes a banking program and, as California's LEV program
will start prior to model year 1999, when the state programs under the OTC recommendation would begin, a manufacturer
may have banked credits under the California program by the time the 1999 model year begins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not believe this raises any question regarding consistency with section 177. Once again, the state regulations
do not require the manufacture of a ``third vehicle''; nor do they prevent the sale of California certified vehicles
in the state, though a slightly different mix of vehicles might be required in the first model year for a manufacturer
who takes advantage of California's banking program. This amounts to a business decision by the manufacturer, and
it does not create any inconsistency. Moreover, a determination that such a situation would be inconsistent with
section 177 would render section 177 a nullity for any program that includes banking, because section 177's lead time
requirements make it very difficult for states to begin their programs at the same time California begins its program.

A comment notes that section 177 applies only to states with plan provisions approved under part D. All states in the
OTR have such approved plan provisions. All states except for Vermont currently contain nonattainment areas with
associated plans. Vermont has approved plan provisions approved under part D related to earlier nonattainment problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the timing of its action is critical for the states' SIP planning purposes. EPA intends to take
final action on the OTC's LEV recommendation in November 1994. Under section 184(c)(5), EPA is to issue a SIP call under
section 110(k)(5) upon approval. EPA intends that final action approving the OTC recommendation would also entail
the SIP call under section 110(k)(5), thus triggering the states' obligation to submit SIP revisions to include the
OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program within one year, or in November 1995. Under any circumstances, and regardless
of EPA's final action on the OTC LEV recommendation, the states are not precluded from adopting and submitting a LEV
SIP revision at any time consistent with sections 177 and 209 of the Act, as they have always had the independent authority
to do.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes, however, that it is possible an alternative program could be promulgated in the future that would
achieve equivalent emissions reductions from new motor vehicles. Logically, such an alternative program that achieves
the emission reductions the OTC LEV program would achieve, could render the OTC LEV program no longer necessary. States
could then decide whether to give auto manufacturers the choice of meeting either OTC LEV standards or the alternative
federal program standards. The alternative program would create emissions standards applicable to new motor vehicles
that automobile manufacturers could, at their option, opt for EPA to apply to their new motor vehicles. EPA expects
that, as long as issues pertaining to the enforceability of such standards can be resolved, such alternative federal
standards could result in emissions benefits in the OTR equivalent to those that would result from the OTC LEV program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is currently working with the federally chartered Clean Air Act Advisory Committee (and a subcommittee created
to consider this topic) to allow for the possibility of such an alternative program that is in the interest of stakeholders
and the public at large. EPA expects to obtain the advice of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee considering issues
related to such a program during the fall of 1994. Thereafter, if there is reason to proceed, EPA would undertake a notice-and-comment
rulemaking to establish the alternative federal standards program, and to promulgate such standards early in 1995.
EPA expects that it will provide a period of time following promulgation for the automakers to decide whether to opt
into the alternative federal standards program. Under a scheme EPA might consider, once automobile manufacturers
opt into this voluntary program, they would be subject to all provisions of the Act and its implementing regulations
(particularly provisions relating to EPA enforcement of standards) that apply to other mandatory standards currently
applicable to such vehicles. EPA believes that, in this manner, it can establish an alternative mechanism to achieve
emissions reductions from new motor vehicles equivalent to those that the OTC LEV program would achieve in the OTR.
The alternative rulemaking would need to address a number of questions, including whether auto companies should
be able to opt out of the program once they have opted in, whether states should give up their opportunity to adopt or
enforce the California LEV program under section 177, and whether a consent decree addressing certain discrete issues
would be useful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's proposed SIP call requiring the OTR states to submit SIP revisions keeps open the option of an alternative federal
program while ensuring that necessary emission reductions are not delayed. Under EPA's proposed SIP call, each state
would be required to submit the OTC LEV program as a SIP revision, but the program could allow auto manufacturers either
to comply with the OTC LEV standards or to opt into and comply with EPA promulgated alternative standards, if such standards
are developed. The states' regulations could provide that the LEV program would not apply to auto manufacturers who
are subject to an equivalent federal program. The states' SIP revisions would have to limit this exception to automakers
subject to an alternative federal program that EPA has promulgated as equivalent to the OTC LEV program. EPA would
address the criteria for its determination of equivalence in any alternative federal standards rulemaking. Under
this approach, the automakers would not necessarily have to forfeit their ability to opt out when they opt into the
alternative standards program. Since the states would all have to adopt and submit an OTC LEV SIP revision, automakers
that either do not opt into or later opt out of the alternative standards program would be required to comply with the
states' OTC LEV program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA approves the OTC petition within the time specified by the Act, states' SIP revisions would be due in November
1995. If states delayed only slightly in meeting this deadline, it could result in an inability to apply the standards
to all vehicles in model year 1999.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another benefit of EPA's proposed approach is that the automakers need not all make the same choice. Rather, automakers
could independently choose whether to achieve the necessary emissions reductions by opting into and complying with
an equivalent federal program or by complying with the OTC LEV program. Further, if the automakers were to attach any
conditions to their opt in to a federal program allowing them to escape its obligations and were to trigger such an escape
provision, they would then fall back to mandatory compliance with the states' adopted OTC LEV programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is taking comment on whether, if all automakers opted into an alternative federal standards program and did not
have a right to opt out, the states should have to adopt the OTC LEV program. The only benefit EPA sees to such an approach
is that the states' LEV program would then be necessary as a ``back-stop'' mechanism used solely to ensure that the
automakers would not opt out of the alternative standards program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also considering another approach that would eliminate the burden of state adoption of the OTC LEV program if
all the automakers opt into an alternative federal program. Under this second option, if the Agency promulgates alternative
emissions standards and auto manufacturers opt into that program and commit not to opt out, the OTC states' obligation
to submit OTC LEV SIP revisions would automatically terminate as no longer necessary. EPA urges states to respond
under either approach to a final approval with immediate action to prepare to submit an OTC LEV SIP revision to EPA by
November 1995.

EPA recognizes that the states have authority to adopt whatever measures they choose beyond those mandated in the
Act in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. EPA is therefore also proposing that it would retain authority
in issuing the SIP call to change its necessary determination and withdraw its SIP call for those states that adopt
controls, including those applicable to stationary and mobile sources, sufficient to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While EPA believes that the emissions reductions that the OTC LEV program would achieve are necessary, the Agency
recognizes that another program to achieve equivalent reductions from the same emissions sources could render the
OTC LEV program unnecessary. But at this juncture the Clean Air Act precludes EPA from mandating another program modifying
the Tier 1 controls on new light-duty vehicles to achieve further emission reductions.

 The OTC's recommendation specifically included in its recitation clauses the OTC's expectation that EPA would evaluate
alternatives comparable to the OTC LEV program, ``including the program presented by the automobile manufacturers
with enhancements.'' Especially in light of this statement, EPA believes it is appropriate to leave open the possibility
that an environmentally equivalent alternative to OTC LEV that is mutually acceptable to the states and automakers
could be developed that would eliminate any need for the states to apply the OTC LEV standard.

Section 209 of the Act preempts states (other than California) from establishing new motor vehicle emissions standards,
leaving such regulation to EPA under title II of the Act. See EPA's earlier notices regarding OTC LEV, 59 FR at 21734
(April 26, 1994); 59 FR at 12915 (March 18, 1994). Of course, section 177 of the Act provides an exception whereby the
OTC states could adopt standards that are identical to California's standards if certain conditions are satisfied.
It is this exception that the OTC has relied upon in recommending that EPA require the states to adopt LEV standards
identical to those California adopted in its LEV program. But the states in the OTR cannot establish alternative new
motor vehicle emissions standards different from but equivalent to California's standards. Likewise, Congress
explicitly provided that EPA may not modify the ``Tier 1'' auto emissions standards specified in subsections 202
(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h), and (i) prior to model year 2004, and thus cannot mandate an alternative that would achieve
equivalent reductions. See 59 FR at 21730 (April 26, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that it is legally appropriate for it to specify in its SIP call that the consummation of an alternative
federal program that achieves equivalent environmental benefits could alter the Agency's conclusion regarding
necessity. Thus, the Agency believes it may specify criteria in this regard that, if satisfied, will terminate the
states' obligations under the SIP call to apply the LEV standards to manufacturers subject to an equivalent alternative
program. At the same time, EPA does not believe there is any reason to wait to determine whether the alternative federal
program will be consummated before issuing the SIP call based on the finding that the OTC LEV program is necessary.
EPA believes that additional new-vehicle tailpipe emission reductions achievable by the OTC LEV program are necessary.
EPA cannot now assume, based on merely the prospect of an alternative federal program and permanent opt-in by all auto
manufacturers, that OTC LEV will become unnecessary. Moreover, as explained earlier, EPA believes it is important
to act now for several reasons, including the statutory deadline under section 184, the statutory requirement that
the states provide two years of lead-time before they can apply standards under section 177 and the length of time it
takes for the fleet to turn over.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it may issue a SIP call that would require that states submit SIP revisions to include the OTC LEV program,
but that would allow the states to accept compliance with an equivalent alternative program instead. Under this option,
as discussed above, the states' obligation to submit the OTC LEV program SIP revision would not terminate upon the
automakers' opt-in to an alternative standards program. This would be necessary, for example, if EPA structured
the alternative program such that the automakers could opt out of it. Indeed, the automakers might insist that they
retain such an ``escape'' in case any state exercised its continuing authority under section 177 to adopt California
standards not consistent with the alternative federal program. Under this structure, the promulgation of the alternative
program would not guarantee that the OTC LEV program would not be necessary, even if all automakers were to opt in initially.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, EPA believes it might appropriately conclude that, as to any particular automaker that opts in and complies
with the alternative program for any period of time, the OTC LEV program would not be necessary for that automaker for
that time. Thus, EPA believes it might find the OTC LEV program necessary but allow states to withhold implementation
of the OTC LEV standards for automakers that opt into the alternative program for as long as they remain in that program.
EPA believes this approach, too, fits squarely within its authority under sections 184(c) and 110(k)(5). That is,
just as EPA believes it may take account of the possibility that an equivalent alternative program could render OTC
LEV no longer necessary, an equivalent alternative program could render OTC LEV unnecessary for particular manufacturers
only for as long as they are bound by that program. EPA believes it may fashion its approach to take account of this, so
that the states must revise their SIPs to include the necessary OTC LEV program, but need only apply it to those parties
for whom and when it is ``necessary'' in light of those parties' choices. In sum, under section 110(k)(5), EPA believes
it may require that states revise their SIPs as necessary to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D), but may allow states
to account in such SIP revisions for circumstances where application of the standards may not be necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(a), if EPA finds that a state fails to make a submission required under the Act, one of the sanctions
specified in section 179(b) is to apply unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after EPA's finding
of failure to submit or incompleteness under section 110(k). Section 179(b) specifies two sanctions available to
the Administrator: Withholding of certain highway funding under section 179(b)(1); and application of a 2:1 offset
ratio to new or modified stationary sources of emissions for which a new source review permit is required under part
D of title I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recently promulgated final regulations to implement section 179 of the Act, which specifies sanctions that are
to apply where states fail to make a submission required under the Act. See 59 FR 39832 (Aug. 4, 1994). These regulations
specify the order in which these sanctions will apply in the case of state non-compliance with provisions of the Act.
These regulations do not, however, address the imposition of sanctions in the case of state failure to comply with
a SIP call under section 110(k)(5) of the Act. Since EPA is proposing a SIP call in this rulemaking, EPA believes it is
appropriate to propose the order of sanctions for purposes of failure to comply if the SIP call is promulgated as a final
regulation. EPA believes that the general scheme promulgated for sanctions generally should also apply here. Under
that scheme, EPA will generally apply the 2:1 offset sanction first and the highway finding sanction second. EPA believes
the rationale for this approach in the sanctions rule applies with equal force here. In addition, EPA is considering
whether the particular circumstances here that states must adopt the OTC LEV program by January 2, 1996 in order to
comply with the two-year lead-time requirement prior to model year 1999 may merit acceleration of sanctions. That
is, EPA requests comment on whether it should provide in the final rule that discretionary sanctions under section
110(m) of the Act would apply beginning immediately upon a finding of failure to submit the OTC LEV program.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing today to promulgate regulations determining, for the purposes of section 177 and Part A of Title II
of the Clean Air Act, the definition of the term ``model year'' as it applies to motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines.
This determination should remove any confusion regarding when a model year commences under section 177. EPA is proposing
this determination in this SNPRM because, if EPA approves the OTC's LEV recommendation, the OTR states will be required
to adopt the LEV program under the provisions of section 177 of the Act. The definition of the term ``model year,'' in
particular, the issue of when a model year begins, has been a major issue in the litigations that have resulted from
New York and Massachusetts's attempts to adopt California LEV standards under section 177. These litigations have
led to considerable confusion regarding when a model year commences under section 177. EPA intends to remove this
confusion by providing nationally consistent regulations providing detailed information regarding the term ``model
year,'' including when such model years commence.

Section 177 of the Act provides that any state which has plan provisions approved under part D may adopt and enforce
California standards for any model year if such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver
has been granted for such model year and if California and the state ``adopt such standards at least two years before
commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of the Administrator).'' Section 202(b)(3)(A)(i)
of the Act defines model year as ``the manufacturer's annual production period (as determined by the Administrator)
which includes January 1 of such calendar year. If the manufacturer has no annual production period, the term `model
year' shall mean the calendar year.'' This definition of model year is repeated in regulations at 40 CFR &sect;86.082&hyph;2
(1992).

EPA has not promulgated regulations providing more specific EPA rules regarding determination of model year. Instead,
EPA has historically relied on Advisory Circulars to clarify agency policy on the determination of model year and
has used these policies and definitions in the enforcement of Federal programs such as vehicle certification. The
first guidance regarding model year was issued on March 27, 1972 (Mobile Source Pollution Control Program (MSPC)
Advisory Circular 6). This guidance was revised by MSPC Advisory Circular 6A (September 1, 1972). The most recent
iteration of this guidance was issued on December 31, 1987 (EPA Office of Mobile Sources Advisory Circular 6B).

While Advisory Circulars have been an adequate mechanism for the purposes of establishing Agency policies and using
such policies for enforcement matters, the fact that EPA relies on Advisory Circulars in addition to its regulations
has been an issue in litigation challenging the adoption of the California LEV program by New York and Massachusetts.
Section 177 states that the term ``model year'' shall be ``as determined by regulations of the Administrator.'' In
the New York litigation (

 and thus was entitled to little deference. The court then provided its own opinion regarding the most appropriate
interpretation of the term ``model year'' in the section 177 context, and found that ``absent promulgated EPA regulations,
`model year' is best read as applying on an industry-wide basis.''

if ``model year'' were defined by engine family, rather than industry-wide, given the existence of the NMOG fleet
averaging program, as well as questions regarding Congressional intent, industry confusion and enforceability.

 However, the First Circuit noted that an argument could be raised that the EPA Advisory Circular is owed no deference
because section 177 specifically requires EPA to define ``model year'' by regulation, not policy statements. The
First Circuit found that since plaintiffs had not raised the argument in earlier proceedings, it was precluded from
raising the issue in its appeal.

In so doing, the First Circuit noted that the EPA's policy had not been newly minted for these litigations, but had been
issued in 1987 and had been applied to section 177 in a letter to Congressman John Dingell (D. Mich.) on March 7, 1991,
prior to litigation.

Judicial review of this issue has thus resulted in contrary results from the two courts of Appeals that have ruled on
the matter. However, while there was division in the circuit courts as to the final result, both courts commented on
the lack of EPA regulations that define model year for the purpose of determining compliance with section 177. Though
EPA continues to believe that the existing regulations and Advisory Circulars are entitled to Chevron deference,
EPA is proposing new regulations specifying its definition of model year as that term is used in section 177 of the Act
in an effort to remove further confusion regarding this issue and to provide national consistency. EPA is also proposing
to apply these regulations to ``model year'' as that term is used for regulation of motor vehicles under Part A of Title
II of the Act. EPA is not proposing to extend this determination at this time to regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles,
which may require somewhat different provisions for ``model year.''

D. Determination of Model Year
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination EPA is proposing today for implementation of section 177 shall include the regulatory definition
of model year as that term has been defined under section 202 of the Act. It shall also include the more specific determinations
regarding model year, including the definition of ``production period,'' delineated in Advisory Circular 6B (Dec.
31, 1987). This Advisory Circular addresses the duration of model year, defines production period and provides information
on EPA policy concerning the duration and applicability of certificates of conformity. It notes that a specific model
year must include January 1 of the calendar year for which it is designated and may not include a January 1 of any other
calendar year, thus limiting the duration of a model year to a calendar year plus 364 days. In addition, Advisory Circular
6B defines ``annual production period'' for any specific model within an engine family of light-duty vehicles or
heavy-duty engines as beginning either: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``(1) When such vehicle or engine is first produced, or (2) on January 2 of the calendar year preceding the year for which
the model year is designated, whichever date is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual production period ends either: (1) when the last such vehicle or engine is produced, or (2) on December 31
of the calendar year for which the model year is named, whichever date is sooner.''

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the definitions of ``duration of model year'' and ``production period for specific models within
an engine family'' which are contained in Advisory Circular 6B are the appropriate definitions to be used to determine
compliance with section 177 as well as to determine compliance with the programs for which the Advisory Circular has
been used in the past. EPA believes these definitions, and the fact that the production period is based on specific
models within engine families, provide vehicle manufacturers the maximum flexibility in terms of adjusting the
model year designation of their product line to marketing needs and product changes. By permitting the designation
of specific engine families, or models within families, as ``pull ahead'' model year families without affecting
the remainder of the vehicles in the model year they are presently building, a manufacturer will be able, for example,
to launch a new vehicle as a 1995 model year vehicle while the remainder of their models are being produced as 1994 models.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also believes that a determination that model year should be determined on a ``model-by-model'' basis is more
appropriate than an interpretation that ``model year'' should begin at the same time industry-wide because the two-year
lead-time of section 177 is better fulfilled through a ``model-by-model'' approach. Manufacturers determine the
start date for manufacture of vehicle models on a model-by-model basis. Therefore, individual manufacturers are
in the best position to determine when each model they produce in a model year will begin production. The lead-time
provisions of section 177 were designed to give manufacturers sufficient lead-time to produce California vehicles
necessary to meet the supply needs of any state that promulgates standards under section 177 (``177 state''). There
is no indication that Congress intended that states be unable to regulate vehicle models that do not begin production
before the two-year deadline. Nor is there any practical reason why a particular vehicle model should not be covered.
Manufacturers are well aware of their own production schedules and can assure that any vehicle models that begin production
after the two-year lead-time ends meet the California requirements in a particular state.

Automobile dealerships in an affected state would be able to contact their manufacturers to find out which vehicle

EPA does not agree with the Second Circuit that an ``industry-wide'' approach to model year would be more appropriate
in the context of California's NMOG fleet averaging program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
79 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fact, though a ``model-by-model'' approach might be more complicated, it actually provides to manufacturers
more control over the particular engine models that will be subject to an averaging program for a particular model
year, especially compared to an ``industry-wide'' approach. Under the ``industry-wide'' approach, a manufacturer
commencing production of its vehicles after the lead-time expires cannot determine for itself what models would
be subject to the California requirements, but must instead find out whether any of its competitor manufacturers
have begun production of a model for that model year prior to the deadline.

EPA notes that this model year determination must be geared toward application to all programs that may be promulgated
by California, not merely the programs promulgated as part of the LEV program. Therefore, application of the model
year determination to a particular program should not be given overwhelming weight in our determination. As the First
Circuit noted, ``[f]leet averaging for emissions programs is a concept devised by California, not Congress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the increased complexity that may be caused by different emission requirements for different vehicles
in a single model year is not unique to the Agency's approach to the term ``model year'' under section 177. In fact, any
program that includes a phase-in of standards (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the ``Tier I'' requirements of section 202(g)) results in different standards for different cars within a model year.
Moreover, the California LEV program itself contemplates that different cars will be certified to different standards
during a single model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, any increased complexity must be balanced against the emissions benefits of such a decision. The best example
of the severe emissions detriment that will occur if the ``industry-wide'' approach is used is the example of Massachusetts'
implementation of the California vehicle program for model year 1995. Massachusetts' promulgation of rules requiring
model year 1995 cars to meet California standards was completed by January 31, 1992. This gave manufacturers a full
two years of lead-time for any vehicle model that began production after January 31, 1994. However, model year 1995
could begin, under EPA rules, by January 2, 1994, and a few vehicle models had begun production by that time. If the ``industry-wide''
approach had been used for the Massachusetts situation, then, conceivably, all manufacturers could continue to
provide all of their model year 1995 vehicles to Massachusetts until December 31, 1995 without meeting the California
standards for any of the vehicles. Thus, there would be close to four years between promulgation of the Massachusetts
rule and full compliance with such rule by manufacturers. Moreover, the ``industry-wide'' rule would require that
California standards not be enforced for any vehicles manufactured in the 1995 model year. Since the 1996 model year
does not begin for any vehicle until, at the earliest, January 2, 1995, the ``industry-wide'' rule would provide almost
three full years between promulgation and any enforcement of California standards. The emissions increases that
would result from the loss of a full model year from the California program could have a significant impact on air pollution
in ``177 states'' and on the ability of such states to meet the attainment deadlines provided in the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``model-by-model'' approach is also preferable to the ``manufacturer-by-manufacturer'' approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
80 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because it substantially lessens the competitiveness concerns that could otherwise result. Given that under the
``model-by-model'' approach, the determination of model year would be based on when each individual model begins
production, there would be less of an opportunity for a manufacturer to exempt its entire vehicle fleet for a full model
year by beginning production of one vehicle model before the two year deadline. Thus, there is considerably less likelihood
that two manufacturers will have to meet different emission standards for all of their vehicles for a particular year
based only on when one model for a particular manufacturer began production. Instead, the ``model-by-model'' approach
is likely to result in similar percentages of vehicles for each manufacturer being covered by California rules for
the ``split'' model year.

The ``manufacturer-by-manufacturer'' approach would allow any manufacturer that had begun production of any model
before the two year deadline to escape enforcement of the state regulations for every model produced by that manufacturer
during that model year. This approach had been mandated by the trial court in the New York LEV case before the Second
Circuit opinion was delivered,

Finally, EPA disagrees with the Second Circuit's belief that Congress did not contemplate a ``split'' model year
approach, differentiating manufacturers based on when each commences production. In fact, EPA's initial Advisory
Circulars explaining EPA's ``model-by-model'' approach were announced in 1972, five years before section 177 was
added to the Clean Air Act. Congress must have at least ``contemplated,'' if not in fact expected, that EPA would interpret
``model year'' for section 177 as it had for section 202.

Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, since this action could result in a rule that would have a substantial
impact, this notice is a ``significant regulatory action'' because the estimated range of annual costs of the California
LEV program in the OTC states is between $300 million and $1.6 billion. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for
review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. EPA
has prepared an economic analysis for this rule under E.O. 12866. A copy of this analysis has been placed in the docket.
Any written comments to EPA and any written EPA responses to those comments regarding this analysis will be included
in the docket for this proceeding.

IX. Impact on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(a), provides that, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking, it must prepare and make available a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). While EPA intends
to follow rulemaking procedures under 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA believes it is not legally required to publish
a general notice of rulemaking here, and hence that it need not prepare a RFA. But even if EPA is required to publish a
general notice of rulemaking here, a RFA is required only for small entities which are directly regulated by the rule.

773 F. 2d 327 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (agency's certification need only consider the rule's impact on regulated entities
and not indirect impact on small entities not regulated). The OTC's recommended LEV program would directly regulate
auto manufacturers. Since these auto manufacturers generally do not qualify as small businesses within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA does not believe a RFA is needed for either the proposed or final rules, even
if a rulemaking is required. Accordingly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Agency has considered the effect of an OTC LEV program on new and used car dealerships as part of its
regulatory impact analysis, even though such analysis is not required because these businesses would not be directly
regulated under the rule. The results of this analysis, set forth in the RIA, indicate that the OTC LEV would not have
a significant economic impact on automobile dealerships.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The extended coverage period described here for a certificate of conformity (i.e., up to one year plus 364 days) is
primarily intended to allow flexibility in the introduction of new models. Under no circumstances should it be interpreted
that existing models may ``skip'' yearly certification by pulling ahead the production of every other model year.
While this situation, to the Agency's knowledge, has not occurred in the past, a practice of producing vehicles for
a two year period would violate Congress's intent of annual certification based upon an annual production period.
The Agency is not currently setting forth rules for how to determine when abuse has occurred, since this has not been
a problem to date. However, the Agency is requiring that manufacturers shall continue to use normal yearly production
periods for existing models.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate of conformity is deemed to be effective and cover
the vehicles or engines named in such certificate and produced during the annual production period, as defined in
&sect;85.2304. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 203 of the Clean Air Act prohibits the sale, offering for sale, delivery for introduction into commerce,
and introduction into commerce of any new vehicle or engine not covered by a certificate of conformity unless it is
an imported vehicle exempted by the Administrator or otherwise authorized jointly by EPA and U.S. Customs service
regulations. However, the Act does not prohibit the production of vehicles or engines without a certificate of conformity.
Vehicles or engines produced prior to the effective date of a certificate of conformity, as defined in paragraph (a)
of this section, may also be covered by the certificate if the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The vehicles or engines conform in all respects to the vehicle or engines described in the application for the certificate
of conformity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The vehicles or engines are not sold, offered for sale, introduced into commerce, or delivered for introduction
into commerce prior to the effective date of the certificate of conformity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Agency is notified prior to the beginning of production when such production will start, and the Agency is provided
full opportunity to inspect and/or test the vehicles during and after their production; for example, the Agency must
have the opportunity to conduct selective enforcement auditing production line testing as if the vehicles had been
produced after the effective date of the certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Vehicles or engines imported by an original equipment manufacturer after December 31 of the calendar year for
which the model year is named are still covered by the certificate of conformity as long as the production of the vehicle
or engine was completed before December 31 of that year. This paragraph does not apply to vehicles that may be covered
by certificates held by independent commercial importers unless specifically approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Vehicles or engines produced after December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named are not covered
by the certificate of conformity for that model year. A new certificate of conformity demonstrating compliance with
currently applicable standards must be obtained for these vehicles or engines, even if they are identical to vehicles
or engines built before December 31.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to require that the sponsor of any drug, biological product, or
device submit certain information concerning the compensation to, and financial interests of, any clinical investigator
conducting clinical studies to determine whether that product meets the marketing requirements specified by the
agency. This requirement will apply to most clinical studies involving human subjects, as well as any study to establish
bioavailability or bioequivalence. The agency is proposing to require that sponsors certify to the absence of certain
financial interests of clinical investigators or disclose those financial interests when clinical studies are
submitted to FDA in support of product marketing. If the agency adopts this proposal, and the sponsor does not include
one of the required submissions with the application for marketing a covered product that contains clinical data,
the agency will refuse to file the application. FDA will propose to extend these requirements to submissions for marketing
approval related to human foods, animal foods, and animal drugs in a notice to be published in a subsequent issue of
the

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a growing recognition in the academic and scientific communities that certain financial arrangements between
clinical investigators and product sponsors, or the personal financial interests of clinical investigators, can
potentially bias the outcome of clinical trials. Although FDA and other government agencies, in parallel with these
communities, are increasingly concerned about the potential for such interests to bias data generated by these studies,
the agency currently has no mechanism to collect information concerning specific financial interests of clinical
investigators who conduct studies in support of product marketing. The creation of a system to collect and analyze
this information will strengthen the product review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 28, 1994, the Public Health Service published a notice of proposed rulemaking on objectivity in research (59
FR 33242&hyph;33251); and the National Science Foundation published a statement of policy on financial disclosure
by scientific investigators (59 FR 33308&hyph;33312).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that these other government agencies have developed such policies and regulations reinforces FDA's concerns
and its decision to seek an appropriate approach to the issue. Of necessity, such an approach differs in some respects
among different agencies, based on differences in their responsibilities and the nature of their relationships
with external communities (i.e., the role of a regulatory agency versus a grant-making agency). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the PHS and NSF documents are broader in scope than the FDA proposed rule and respond to principles that
govern federally funded grants and contracts. The concerns of PHS and NSF include the stewardship of public research
funds and the assurance of objectivity in the research supported by these funds. Receipt of Federal funds for research
is a privilege, and, just as such funds are granted for all types of research, PHS and NSF are interested in guarding
against bias in all research.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In contrast, drug and device manufacturers are required under statutory authority to submit clinical trial data
in order to gain FDA approval to market a product. FDA's concerns are more narrowly focused on evaluating the reliability
of clinical data submissions in support of marketing approval because FDA must rely on submitted clinical data in
making decisions on the safety and effectiveness of regulated products. FDA's primary interest is in the potential
of certain financial interests to bias the outcome of clinical studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the agency's special regulatory responsibilities, FDA's proposed rule differs from the NIH regulation
and the NSF policy in terms of the research conducted by potentially affected investigators and in two other respects
as well. FDA's proposed rule does not include a financial interest of a clinical investigator in a firm that owns a product
that would compete with the tested product for market share, and FDA is not proposing to require disclosure of financial
interests and arrangements in or with the sponsor by full-time employees of the sponsor. In addition, FDA's proposed
rule does not identify a specific threshold dollar which would trigger disclosure of financial interests. Instead,
FDA is requesting public comment on whether setting a threshold amount is appropriate, and if so, what the dollar amount
should be. These additional differences, and FDA's interest in obtaining comment on them, are discussed further
in section II.D. of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is concerned about financial interests that are unknown or undisclosed to the agency and potentially unmanaged
by product sponsors to guard against purposeful or inadvertent bias. In particular, FDA is concerned about those
types of financial interests whose value is heavily influenced by the outcome of the research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clinical research data provide the basis for FDA's assessment of the safety and effectiveness of new human drugs,
devices, and biologics, the assessment of the bioequivalence of generic drugs and sometimes the substantial equivalence
of devices. It is essential that these data be reliable and that steps be taken to minimize possible effects on the data
resulting from potential bias on the part of an investigator. FDA acknowledges that there are many factors that could
give investigators a preference for a particular outcome, but a significant financial interest in the outcome of
the study is of particular concern. Bias, as used here, means a purposeful or inadvertent preference of the clinical
investigator for a particular study outcome that interferes with the clinical investigator's impartiality in conducting
a clinical study. Bias could, for example, interfere with a clinical investigator's impartiality in assessing the
outcome of therapy; in assigning patients to treatment (so that patients who receive the test product are those with
a better prognosis); in interpreting an adverse event: in assessing the outcome of the therapy; or in deciding upon
use of concomitant therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any discussion of potential sources of bias, it is important to distinguish between the actual conduct of studies
and collection of data by clinical investigators, on the one hand, and the use of those studies, i.e., the analysis,
interpretation, and presentation of the data from those studies by the sponsor, on the other. In the analysis, interpretation,
and presentation of data, a commercial sponsor would be expected to have a clear preference for a particular result,
and FDA's review of the sponsor's submissions proceeds with awareness of the sponsor's interests and potential biases.
The agency regularly examines, and in some cases repeats, the statistical analysis carried out by sponsors for scientific
adequacy and for accuracy, basing these examinations on the raw data collected by clinical investigators. When there
is a choice of analysis or study endpoints, the agency can usually determine whether they were specified prospectively
or chosen without knowledge of the study outcome, and whether the choice appears scientifically credible. Where
more than one analysis is possible, FDA can independently weigh the arguments for and against a given approach. FDA
can, thus, deal with potential sponsor biases in the analyses and interpretation of submitted data because the agency
has complete access to the raw data and a complete description of the analyses the sponsor chose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, there is no way to assess completely the accuracy of the raw data themselves, although the agency can,
and does, take steps to help assure their validity. FDA provides guidance to sponsors of drugs, biologics and devices
on how to develop monitoring systems that their study monitors can use to ensure that data generated in clinical trials
are accurate and complete. As further protection against isolated unreliable data, the agency generally requires
findings to be replicated before they can serve as the basis for marketing decisions; and clinical data may also be
subjected to field inspections through the agency's bioresearch monitoring program. In many cases, clinical trial
results arise from the combined efforts of many investigators, so that a regulatory conclusion does not depend on
a single investigator's efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, however, limits to the protection these steps provide against potential bias. Even if the primary responsibility
of the study monitor to the sponsor is discounted, monitors cannot verify many of the observations made independently
by investigators. Moreover, while the bioresearch monitoring program is immensely valuable in detecting certain
kinds of data problems, including errors or bias leading to an inconsistency between what is reported to FDA and information
in independently generated records (for example, nurses's notes, laboratory slips, office records, hospital records)
and can often detect sloppiness or deliberate fraud, it has limited ability to detect faulty assessment of study endpoints,
or failure to record adverse effects. Thus, although the agency tries to ensure that data are reliable, FDA relies
considerably on independent clinical investigators to provide valid and reliable data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessing the reliability of data is a fundamental aspect of FDA's evaluation. It is just as critical as assessing
the adequacy of study design, the completeness of the studies carried out, and the meaning of the results. Therefore,
financial arrangements and interests that could affect reliability of data need to be identified and considered.
Such interests are already considered to exist and are taken into account when a clinical investigator is a full-time
employee of a sponsor. When the investigator is not a full-time employee, the interests and arrangements that need
to be identified and considered include financial arrangements in which the value of financial compensation received
by the clinical investigator could be affected by the study outcome; significant payments of other sorts, such as
grants for ongoing research, compensations in the form of equipment, retainers or honoraria; a proprietary interest
of the investigator in the tested product, such as a patent; or a significant equity interest in the sponsoring company.
Such arrangements and interests, especially if combined with such clinical trial features as open (unblinded) study
designs, studies with subjective endpoints, and single-investigator studies, may increase the risk that purposeful
or inadvertent bias could influence the outcome of the study. FDA needs to be aware of influences that could affect
data reliability.

II. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing this proposal, the agency has considered three broad areas: (1) Identification of financial information
that should be reported by sponsors to FDA; (2) procedures for reporting this information; and (3) steps the agency
should take to deal with potential bias in data from studies by clinical investigators found to have potentially problematic
financial interests. FDA has also considered the proper balance between the agency's desire to detect and help to
minimize bias in clinical data and the need to avoid intrusion into the privacy of clinical investigators and unreasonable
administrative burdens on sponsors and on agency staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering procedures for reporting such information, the agency has sought to identify the method that would
be least burdensome for sponsors and for agency staff. FDA has determined that a simple, direct and effective method
of minimizing reporting requirements would be to give every sponsor the option of either certifying to FDA as to the
absence of certain financial interests and arrangements of the investigators conducting clinical studies of the
sponsor's product or alternatively, disclosing those interests and describing the steps taken to minimize the impact
of possible bias. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to require that the sponsor of any product submitted to the agency
for marketing approval submit a list of clinical investigators and make one of two alternative submissions for each
clinical investigator who is not identified by the sponsor as a full-time employee of the sponsor at the time reports
of clinical studies and their accompanying data are submitted in support of product marketing. The alternative submissions
are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The sponsor may certify that for any clinical study relied upon by the sponsor to establish that the product meets
the regulatory requirements for approval: (a) The sponsor has not entered into any financial arrangement with any
clinical investigator in which the value of financial compensation received by the clinical investigator for conducting
the studies could be affected by the outcome of the research; (b) the investigator has not received significant payments
of other sorts from the sponsor, such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, a retainer
for ongoing consultation, or honoraria; (c) the clinical investigator has no proprietary interest, such as a patent
or other direct financial interest in the clinically tested product; and (d) the clinical investigator holds no significant
equity interest in the sponsor's company.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If the sponsor does not provide certification, the sponsor must disclose the specific financial arrangements
made with the clinical investigator, the investigator's proprietary and equity interests in the tested product
and the sponsor's company, and describe steps taken to minimize the potential for bias in data submitted in support
of product applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a statement of certification or disclosure does not accompany an application containing clinical data, the agency
will refuse to file the application. The agency believes that clinical investigators are responsible for providing
the sponsor with sufficient accurate financial information to allow preparation of complete and accurate statements
and is proposing to require that investigators make such information available to sponsors. Disclosure and certification
requirements will extend not only to the clinical investigator, but also to the investigator's immediate family
(i.e., spouse and dependent children). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed regulation applies only to submissions for human drugs, biological products, and devices,
sponsors also submit data from independent clinical investigators_i.e., clinical investigators who are not the
sponsor's employees_in support of submissions such as food and color additives, infant formulas, health claims,
and animal drug applications (i.e., studies involving animals that are equivalent to clinical studies). The agency
will also propose to apply these requirements to submissions for marketing approval related to human foods, animal
foods, and animal drugs in a notice to be published in a subsequent issue of the

B. The Certification Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;54.4(a)(1) the following language for use by sponsors as a certification statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to all covered clinical studies [or to specific clinical studies listed below] submitted in support
of this application, I certify that (name of applicant) has not entered into any financial arrangement with any clinical
investigator, whereby the value of compensation to the investigator to conduct the study could be affected by the
outcome of the study. I also certify that each clinical investigator was required to disclose to (name of applicant)
whether the investigator had a proprietary interest in this product, or a significant equity interest in (name of
applicant), and that no such interests were disclosed. I further certify that the investigator was not the recipient
of significant payments of other kinds as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this statement, a clinical investigator includes the spouse, and each dependent child of the investigator
as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(d). This certification is made in compliance with 21 CFR part 54. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Rationale for the Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing this policy, FDA met with representatives of numerous scientific and health care organizations, as
well as industry, consumers and other Government agencies. On September 9, 1993, FDA's Science Board convened a public
meeting to discuss financial disclosure by clinical investigators. There was general support for development of
this policy expressed at the meeting by board members and most public speakers. The following Government groups were
represented at the meeting: PHS, the National Institutes of Health, NSF, and the National Academy of Sciences. The
discussion included updates by representatives of these government agencies on the development of their policies
and rules pertaining to conflict of interest and financial disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presentations were also made by the American Medical Association, the Society for Clinical Trials, the American
Federation for Clinical Research, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Health Research Group, the
National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Service Organizations, the Women's Health Network, the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. The Biotechnology Industry Organization
submitted a written statement to the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA met informally with organizations representing major segments of the regulated industry, consumer
organizations, professional societies, and investigators. During the meetings, the following issues were discussed:
(1) The identification of financial arrangements that have the potential for generating bias; (2) the extent of disclosure
by clinical investigators to sponsors; (3) the impact of public disclosure of clinical investigators' financial
interests; and (4) to whom a requirement for disclosure of financial interests might apply (e.g., the investigator's
immediate family, significant business partners). Financial arrangements discussed included payments in the
form of equity, such as stock and stock options, and compensation tied to the sales of the product, such as royalty interests.
From these informal discussions, it appears that in most cases clinical investigators are not asked by sponsors to
divulge any financial interest held by the investigators in the sponsoring firm prior to performing a clinical study.
(Minutes and other disclosable statements are available at the Dockets Management Branch (address above)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring sponsors to obtain information on and either certify or disclose their clinical investigators' relevant
financial interests and arrangements is intended to help ensure that sponsors consider these matters in the early
stages of product development and, if necessary, consider how best to minimize potential sources of bias. FDA believes
that in most cases, sponsors would be able to provide certification for clinical investigators and would not need
to submit any further information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that therapeutically beneficial products have been developed through investigations in which clinical
investigators were compensated in ways that may have influenced the outcome of the study and is therefore not intending
to prohibit such arrangements, or rule out reliance on affected studies as a basis for product approval, but intends
to give such studies particularly close scrutiny and evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring certification or disclosure at the time of submission of marketing applications does not preclude a sponsor
from seeking the agency's advice at the early stages of product development with respect to a potentially problematic
financial arrangement with a clinical investigator. Indeed, FDA strongly encourages early consultation in cases
where the sponsor may be entering into problematic financial arrangements with a clinical investigator. The agency
will work with sponsors in planning careful management of such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require certification or disclosure only with respect to the clinical data submissions in support
of marketing applications because if this information were submitted prior to beginning clinical studies, agency
staff would be unduly burdened with evaluating financial information for every clinical study undertaken, many
of which never lead to marketing applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively chosen not to seek information on investigators carrying out preclinical or manufacturing and
controls operations for a number of reasons. Employees of the sponsor develop most of these data, and FDA already considers
the financial interests of these employees. Also, these data are often verified independently and are relatively
insensitive to inadvertent bias. In contrast, clinical data are more susceptible to inadvertent, unrecognized
bias on the part of investigators. FDA recognizes that, despite these reasons, biased preclinical or chemistry work
could also affect product approvals and welcomes comments on possible approaches the agency could take to ensure
the reliability of such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that these requirements for certification or disclosure should apply not only to the clinical investigator's
interests, but to the interests of the investigator's immediate family as well. The financial interests of a clinical
investigator's immediate family are effectively shared by the investigator and thus would be as potentially biasing
as if they were under the investigator's name. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency envisions that the financial arrangements and steps taken to minimize bias will vary with different product
applications and will review these applications on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a study design is sufficiently
robust as a result of factors such as independent data monitoring, multiple investigators, blinding, and independent
endpoint assessment, FDA could determine that a problematic financial interest would not likely introduce bias.
In other situations, there might be sufficient replication of critical results to render the questionable data less
important, or it might be possible to carry out further analyses or observations (reexamination of hospital records
or patients) that would provide assurance as to the reliability of the data. In still others, intensified scrutiny
by FDA's bioresearch monitoring staff might be sufficient to permit FDA to accept the data in support of product marketing
applications. In some cases, however, FDA might not be able to conclude that the data were reliable and might require
sponsors to conduct further studies. The agency seeks comment as to other appropriate steps that FDA might take to
respond to applications that may be considered problematic with respect to potential bias.

D. Related Issues for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Public Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also seeks comment on whether publicly disclosing a clinical investigator's financial interests would
serve a useful purpose. FDA also requests comment on what might constitute an appropriate forum for such release_for
example, whether it would be useful to disclose such information to an outside advisory committee considering the
tested product. Public disclosure of such information is subject to any limitations on disclosure imposed by the
Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act and other applicable Federal statutes. FDA requests comment on whether
the value of public release is outweighed by the right to privacy of clinical investigators with respect to their financial
affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Definition of a Clinical Investigator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of this proposed rule, FDA defines a clinical investigator as including the spouse and each dependent
child of the investigator. FDA is aware of instances in which problematic financial interests or arrangements have
been listed under the name of a business partner or business associate of a clinical investigator with whom the investigator
shared the interests or arrangements, so that the potentially biasing factor is not readily traceable to the clinical
investigator. The agency seeks comment on whether the definition of a clinical investigator should include business
partners of the investigator as well and, if so, how ``business partner'' should be defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Scope and Amount of Financial Interests that Should Be Disclosed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposing to require disclosure of any significant equity interest held by a clinical investigator in the sponsor,
the agency has defined a significant equity interest as ``any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial
interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a
publicly traded corporation that exceeds 5 percent of total equity (see proposed &sect;54.2(b)). FDA seeks public
comment on this definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also seeks comment on whether to require information on other investigator interests or payments to investigators
that are not directly related to the conduct of a study. These types of arrangements might give the investigator an
``interest'' in the company, such as financial ties with a firm or other entity that supplies, or is likely to supply
equipment, materials, or services for work performed by the investigator; financial ties with parties whose financial
interests would be, or would seem to be, directly and significantly affected by the investigator's work; financial
ties with, or financial support from, any firm that markets, produces, or has in premarket testing a product that is,
or will likely be, affected by the investigator's research. FDA also requests comment on whether there should be a
``threshold of concern'' with respect to such payments, (i.e., whether the agency should be concerned only when these
forms of compensation to investigators exceed a certain threshold amount). Several academic institutions have
instituted de minimis levels for disclosure, such as $5,000 cash and $20,000 equity interest in a publicly held and
widely traded company. FDA has not identified a threshold amount and seeks public comment on whether a threshold dollar
amount should be set, and if so, what that amount should be. The agency also seeks comments on any other financial relationships
or arrangements that should raise concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Ownership by a Clinical Investigator of Stock in a Competing Product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach taken by FDA in this proposed rule differs from that of PHS and NSF in that the agency has not included ownership
by a clinical investigator of stock in a product that would compete with the tested product for market share. This issue,
FDA believes, is appropriately of concern to sponsors. The agency seeks comment on whether such ownership substantially
threatens an individual clinical investigator's objectivity and whether there is a manageable basis for reporting
this kind of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Disclosure of Financial Interests by Full-Time Employees of the Sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's approach also differs from that of PHS and NSF in that FDA is not proposing to require disclosure of financial
interests and arrangements in or with the sponsor by full-time employees of the sponsor. FDA assumes the clinical
investigator who is a full-time employee of the sponsor has a clear interest in the outcome of research and accounts
for this potential bias in the level of scrutiny with which the agency reviews the submitted data. FDA seeks comment
as to what disclosure, if any, by a clinical investigator, who is a full-time employee of the sponsor, of interests
in the sponsor other than salary might contribute to minimizing bias. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Disclosure by Clinical Investigators to Both PHS and FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHS notice of proposed rulemaking on objectivity in research (59 FR 33242) would require that an institution receiving
a PHS grant for research must solicit and review financial disclosure statements from each investigator who is planning
to participate in PHS-funded research. The Institution would make available to the Department of Health and Human
Services, upon request, information regarding all significant financial interests identified by the institution
and how those interests have been managed, reduced, or eliminated to protect the research from bias. In this proposed
regulation, FDA would require that the sponsor of a marketing application for a regulated product either certify
as to the absence of certain financial interests and arrangements of the investigators conducting clinical studies
of the sponsor's product, or disclose those interests and describe the steps taken to minimize the impact of possible
bias.

As noted in Section I. of this document, these two proposed regulations respond to different principles and are based
on different relationships with external communities. Nevertheless, there is potential for the two regulations
to overlap in a small number of instances involving PHS-funded clinical research on FDA-regulated products. Public
comment is sought on whether, in such instances, clinical investigators should be required to disclose financial
interests both to the institution receiving PHS funds and to the sponsor submitting a marketing application to FDA,
and whether meeting the PHS requirement for disclosure to the institution should be considered to satisfy FDA's requirement
for disclosure to the sponsor of a marketing application.

III. Legal Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is generally authorized by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and the Public Health Service
Act to approve drugs, devices, and biological products for marketing if the products are demonstrated to be safe and
effective for their intended uses and are properly labeled. More specifically, new drugs are approved for marketing
if they meet the safety and effectiveness criteria set forth in section 505(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)) and the
implementing regulations (21 CFR part 314). To demonstrate effectiveness, the law requires evidence from adequate
and well-controlled clinical studies on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly and responsibly conclude
that the drug has the effect it is purported to have. Section 505(j)(3)(F) of the act authorizes the approval of an abbreviated
new drug application if, among other things, there is sufficient information to show that the drug is ``bioequivalent
to the listed drug referred to in the application.'' Under section 505(e) of the act, approval of a new drug application
is to be withdrawn if new information shows that the drug has not been demonstrated to be either safe or effective. Approval
may also be withdrawn if new information shows that the drug's labeling is false or misleading. Under section 505(d)(4)
of the act, in determining whether a drug is ``safe for use'' under the conditions proposed, the agency may consider
not only information such as data from clinical studies, but also ``any other information'' before the agency relevant
to the determination. In deciding whether the drug's proposed labeling would be ``false or misleading'' under section
505(d)(7) of the act, the agency is also to evaluate ``all material facts.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(k) of the act authorizes the agency to promulgate regulations requiring applicants to make records and
reports of data or other information that are necessary to enable the agency to determine whether there is reason to
withdraw approval of a new drug application or an abbreviated new drug application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is similar authority under section 351(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) to approve biological
products if their ``safety, purity, and potency'' are demonstrated; section 351 also authorizes the promulgation
of regulations designed to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's authority to regulate medical devices arises from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended
by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the 1976 amendments), the Safe Medical Device Amendments of 1990, and the
Medical Device Amendments of 1992.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the 1976 amendments, devices are divided into preamendments devices, i.e., those devices in commercial distribution
prior to May 28, 1976, the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments, and postamendments devices, i.e., those devices
first in commercial distribution on or after the enactment of the 1976 amendments. All devices are then further classified
into class I, II, or III, depending on the degree of regulatory control necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness.
Class III devices are the most highly regulated category of devices and, unless exempted, are subject to premarket
approval by FDA. A device may be classified into class III: (1) By operation of law if the device is a ``new'' device,
i.e., it was not on the market before the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments; (2) if FDA classifies or reclassifies
the device into class III; or (3) by operation of law under 21 U.S.C. 360j(l) because it is a transitional device that
was previously regarded as a new drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An unapproved class III device may be investigated for purposes of obtaining FDA approval under an investigational
device exemption (IDE) (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)). Under three IDE regulatory provisions, FDA can require any information
``relevant'' to the review of the application (21 CFR 812.20(b)(12), 812.20(c), and 813.20(b)(18)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clinical data generated under an IDE and other data and information are used by FDA as a basis to grant marketing approval
for class III devices and as a basis to reclassify a device. The law requires that a premarket approval application
(PMA) contain ``full reports of all information,'' known to, or which should reasonably be known to, the applicant
concerning investigations concerning the safety and effectiveness of the device (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(1)(A)). In
approving a PMA, FDA must make the determination, inter alia, that there is a showing of reasonable assurance that
the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed
labeling, and that based on a fair evaluation of all material facts the proposed labeling is not false or misleading
(21 U.S.C. 360e(b)). In deciding whether to grant or deny approval of a PMA, FDA relies upon ``valid scientific evidence''
which includes evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective
trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of
significant human experience with a marketed device *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)). FDA evaluates
the data submitted and determines whether it constitutes ``valid scientific evidence'' for the purpose of determining
the safety and effectiveness of a particular device ``and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole is
adequate to support a determination that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for
its conditions of use.'' (21 CFR 860.7(c)(1)). In determining whether a device should be reclassified, FDA relies
upon the same regulatory definition of ``valid scientific evidence.'' Section 515(e)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C 360(e)(1))
authorizes the agency to withdraw approval of an application if, on the basis of ``new information,'' there is a lack
of a showing of reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use, or the labeling
of the device is false or misleading in any particular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA may also use clinical data to determine whether a ``new device,'' i.e. a device marketed after the date of the enactment
of the 1976 amendments, may be removed from its automatic statutory class III status and thereby be exempt from premarket
approval requirements (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)). Such devices may be marketed without premarket approval if FDA issues
an order finding them ``substantially equivalent'' to a predicate device that does not require premarket approval
(21 U.S.C. 360c(i)(1)). In determining whether a device is ``substantially equivalent'' to a predicate device,
FDA must determine, on the basis of a premarket application submission (510(k) submission)(21 U.S.C. 360(k)), that
the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and that the device ``has the same technological characteristics
as the predicate device, or *&blank;*&blank;* has different technological characteristics and the [submission]
*&blank;*&blank;* contains information, including clinical data if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates
that the device is as safe and effective'' as the predicate device and does not raise different questions of safety
and efficacy than the predicate device. (Id.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to sections 519 and 701 of the act, (21 U.S.C. 360i and 371) FDA has broad authority to promulgate regulations
governing the approval of devices. Section 519(a) of the act requires manufacturers of devices to ``establish and
maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may, by regulation, reasonably
require to assure that such device is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety and effectiveness.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, a critical part of the agency's function is examining clinical data to determine if the safety and effectiveness
requirements of the act and the Public Health Service Act have been met. FDA is authorized by sections 505(i) and 701(a)
of the act to promulgate regulations governing the conduct of studies of investigational drugs, including unlicensed
biological products. There is similar authority relating to studies of devices under sections 510(k), 513, 515,
520(g), and 522 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k), 360c, 360e, 360j(g), and 360l). Pursuant to this authority, FDA has previously
promulgated regulations whose purpose is to ensure the reliability of data submitted to FDA in support of marketing
applications. FDA's investigational new drug application regulations (21 CFR part 312), promulgated under section
505(i) of the act, and its investigational device exemptions regulations (21 CFR parts 812 and 813), promulgated
under section 520(g) of the act, are intended, among other things, to help ensure the validity and reliability of clinical
study results submitted to FDA in support of new drug applications (NDA's) and supplements; premarket approval applications,
and premarket notification submissions (510(k) submissions) for devices; and license applications and supplements
for biological products. The Supreme Court has upheld the authority of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to issue
regulations to ensure the reliability of clinical study results, including requirements to minimize bias. (See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, the academic and scientific communities have turned their attention to the general issue of conflict
of interest on research. One issue that has received particular attention has been the potential for the financial
interests of investigators to bias the results of studies. There has been much discussion of the importance of protecting
study outcomes from potential bias resulting from investigator interests in the area of applied research, such as
research that supports the marketing applications for human medical products. This concern is shared by the PHS and
NSF, both of which are currently developing regulations and policies regarding financial disclosure by clinical
investigators and by FDA. FDA believes that it is important to the public health to ensure that the data submitted to
the agency in support of marketing applications are free of the effects of such bias as much as possible. The agency
has concluded that this regulation requiring certification and disclosure of certain financial information of
clinical investigators is necessary to enable FDA to approve human medical products on the basis of valid, reliable,
and unbiased data. FDA believes that the regulation is fully authorized under sections 505, 510(k), 513, 515, 519,
520(g), 522, and 701(a) of the act, and by section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing these reporting requirements because the information received will enable the agency to determine
the reliability of data submitted in marketing applications more effectively. More effective review of products
proposed for marketing provides greater protection to the public health, and therefore results in improved implementation
of the act. FDA believes that it is essential to be able to inspect the underlying documents forming the basis of a sponsor's
certification or disclosure statement. Access to these records is consistent with the agency's overall statutory
authority to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, biological product, and devices. FDA's authority to require
maintenance of records and to provide for agency access to these records was upheld in

IV. Alternatives Considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA considered several approaches to handling the issue of potential bias of research data resulting from the financial
interests of clinical investigators before deciding to adopt the certification and disclosure procedures described
in this document. Two other obvious possibilities would be the prohibition of certain financial interests by the
agency, e.g., compensation in the form of equity in the firm, and divestiture by the investigator of a prohibited interest.
FDA believes that prohibition and divestiture of financial interests might have a disproportionate and unduly severe
effect on certain industries in which an individual who has the closest financial ties, e.g., the inventor of a device
being tested, is often involved as an investigator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other situations, such as small start up biotechnology firms, payments to clinical investigators are sometimes
made in the form of equity interests, such as stock options, because these firms have limited capital. These industries
rely heavily on such arrangements because they are young and not well capitalized and yet are highly creative and produce
many novel products. In addition, the agency believes that the proposed approach is more appropriate in light of the
fact that a number of Federal programs have been created in recent years specifically to encourage partnerships between
industry, academia, and Government in the belief that such relationships result in important innovation. Examples
of such programs include the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;480), which encourages
technological transfer, particularly through collaboration between industry and the academic community. The
Patent and Trademark Act Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;517) allow universities and other funding recipients
to apply for patents developed with Federal funding (rather than awarding such rights to the Government), and expressly
promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations. The Economic Recovery Tax Act
of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;34) is aimed at fostering research and development by small companies and associated university
partners. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;502), which amended Pub. L. 96&hyph;480,
and Executive Order 12592, provide similar patent and licensing authority to Federal laboratories and encourage
them to participate in cooperative research and development agreements with the private sector and nonprofit organizations.

1In calculating this burden respondents are assumed to be sponsors of marketing applications. On average, 20 sponsors
submit marketing applications for biologics each year, 246 submit applications for drugs, and 125 submit applications
for devices. Responses are broken down into the number of investigators certifying and disclosing for each sponsor's
application. The average number of clinical investigators conducting studies related to a marketing application
for a biologic is 11; for a drug, 120; and for a device, 10. It is estimated that the sponsor for a marketing application
for a biologic will submit certification statements for 10 investigators and a disclosure statement for 1. It is estimated
that a drug sponsor will submit certification statements for 115 and disclosure statements for 5. It is estimated
that a device sponsor will submit certification statements for 8 investigators and disclosure statements for 2.
Finally, it is estimated that .5 hours (30 minutes) will be required per submission. In the absence of a firm basis for
estimating the frequency of either certification or disclosure, the agency is using the conservative estimate of
.5 hours per response, although it is estimated that .25 hours (15 minutes) will be required for the preparation and
submission of a certification statement and .5 hours (30 minutes) will be required for the preparation and submission
of a disclosure statement.

1In calculating this burden, recordkeepers are assumed to be sponsors. It is assumed that each sponsor will submit
one application. The hours per recordkeeper are arrived at by multiplying the average number of clinical investigators
involved in each sponsor's submitted application (11 for biologics, 120 for drugs, and 10 for devices) by the time
estimated for filing the financial information received from each investigator, which is .5 hours. This is considered
to be a one-time burden and one that would not be repeated on an annual basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA is submitting a copy of this proposed rule
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of these information collection requirements, including
suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503,

VI. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
VII. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is consistent on essential points with actions
proposed by other agencies of which FDA is aware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. This rule will create costs in three areas: reporting, recordkeeping, and research.
The reporting and recordkeeping burdens, which are fully described in section V. of this document, are the minimum
necessary to achieve the goals of this proposed regulation. Research costs will amount to costs incurred by sponsors
in validating data that is potentially compromised and are difficult to estimate because these situations can be
expected to vary and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. FDA will encourage sponsors to consult with agency
staff on management of potentially problematic situations early on so that verifying the reliability of the data
will be less burdensome. FDA has not proposed to prohibit certain financial interests, such as compensation to investigators
in the form of equity in the sponsor's firm, nor is the agency proposing to require divestiture by the investigator
of any financial interest, because such provisions could impact significantly on certain small entities and hinder
their ability to bring innovative products to market. For these reasons, the agency certifies that the proposed rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

VIII. Conforming Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Amendments to Regulations for Human Drug Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
While the proposed rule would not require sponsors to submit certification and disclosure statements until they
submit a marketing application, FDA believes that sponsors should acquire financial information from investigators
before starting clinical investigations. Consequently, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;312.53(c), the regulation
governing the selection of investigators, to require sponsors to obtain financial information from clinical investigators.
The agency believes that early acquisition of financial information by sponsors would be prudent to enable sponsors
to discover any possible bias by the investigator that might affect the conduct of the clinical investigation before
the investigation begins. Additionally, this would permit sponsors to consult FDA regarding potential bias before
the sponsor and the agency have devoted resources to the clinical investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to &sect;312.57 would require sponsors to maintain records on compensation agreements and
all other financial interests of investigators and investigators' immediate families as described in part 54. The
agency notes that such information would be required to be made available for inspection under existing regulations.
The proposed amendment to &sect;312.64 would require clinical investigators to provide sponsors with sufficient
accurate information to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;314.50 and 314.60 (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.60) to require that all new drug
applications, amendments to applications, and supplements that contain new data from a previously unreported study
include a certification or disclosure statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;314.94 to require certification or disclosure statements in abbreviated new drug
applications. While section 505(j)(2)(A) of the act does not specifically mention certification or disclosure
statements, section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the act authorizes the agency to require ``information to show that the
new drug is bioequivalent to the listed drug.'' Thus, the proposed requirement would allow FDA to better judge the
reliability of bioequivalence data, and is within the scope of section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under this proposal, the agency would refuse to file any application or abbreviated antibiotic application, and
refuse to receive any abbreviated new drug application that does not contain a certification or disclosure statement.
Current regulations allow FDA to refuse to file or receive incomplete applications. Proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;314.50
and 314.94 would require certification or disclosure to accompany applications and abbreviated applications,
therefore, any application or abbreviated application not containing a certification or disclosure statement
would be incomplete and would not be filed or received. If FDA refuses to file or receive an application or abbreviated
application, FDA will not review the application because the agency has determined that the application is not sufficiently
complete to allow substantive review. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;314.60 to allow the agency to refuse to accept
amendments that contain clinical data without a certification or disclosure statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency would amend &sect;&sect;314.200 and 314.300 to require any person who submits clinical data as part of
the hearing process for refusals to approve and for withdrawals of approvals for NDA's, abbreviated antibiotic drug
applications (AADA's), or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA's) or the hearing process for issuing, amending,
and withdrawing antibiotic regulations to submit a certification or disclosure statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed amendments to &sect;320.36 (21 CFR 320.36) would require similar reporting and recordkeeping for certification
and disclosure statements accompanying bioequivalence studies as would be required under part 312. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed amendments to &sect;330.10 (21 CFR 330.10) would require certification or disclosure statements to accompany
clinical data submitted as a part of the over-the-counter (OTC) monograph process. FDA believes that the clinical
data submitted for OTC drug products are no less important than data submitted as part of the NDA or ANDA processes and
should be treated similarly. In the case of OTC monographs, because all data are publicly available, this disclosure
should also be part of the public record even if it is not made public for NDA's and ANDA's.

B. Amendments to Regulations for Biologicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA is proposing to amend the regulations at &sect;601.2(a) (21 CFR 601.2(a)) governing the filing of applications
for product licenses by adding a sentence to require the inclusion of a financial certification or disclosure statement
as follows: ``The applicant shall also include a financial certification or disclosure statement as required by
part 54 of this chapter.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Amendments to Regulations for Medical Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency realizes that not all 510(k) premarket notification submissions contain clinical data. Because current
regulations do not authorize FDA to require certification or disclosure statements, the agency proposes to specifically
require such statements by adding a new paragraph to &sect;807.87 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(21 CFR 807.87). After review of a 510(k), FDA does not ``file the application'' but has other options, depending upon
the information contained in the submission. Therefore, the agency proposes to withhold the decision on the 510(k)
submission until a certification or disclosure statement is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that the historical file relating to a device may be retained in more than one location. FDA believes
however, that a copy of the certification or disclosure statement should be accessible pursuant to &sect;807.31
(21 CFR 807.31) and proposes to amend the regulation to accommodate accessibility. A proposed amendment to &sect;812.110
would require clinical investigators to provide to sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow
sponsors to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements. Therefore, FDA is also proposing
to amend &sect;814.20 to require sponsors to include in premarket approval applications a financial certification
or disclosure statement as required by part 54, and to amend &sect;814.42 (21 CFR 814.42) to allow the agency to refuse
to file an application or amendments that contain clinical data without a certification or disclosure statement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because supporting data are needed in a reclassification petition to satisfy the requirements of a determination
of safety and effectiveness of a device, FDA is proposing to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;860.123 to require any sponsor who submits clinical data as part of a reclassification petition to include
a certification or disclosure statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates clinical studies submitted in marketing applications as required
by law for new human drugs and biological products and marketing applications and reclassification petitions for
medical devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The agency reviews data generated in these clinical studies to determine whether the applications are approvable
under the statutory requirements. FDA may consider clinical studies inadequate and the data inadequate if, among
other things, appropriate steps have not been taken in the design, conduct, reporting, and analysis of the studies
to minimize bias. One potential source of bias in clinical studies is a financial interest of the clinical investigator
in the outcome of the study, either because the amount of compensation the investigator receives may be influenced
by the outcome of the study, or because the investigator has a financial interest in the product under study or in the
sponsor of the marketing application. This section and conforming regulations require the sponsor of a marketing
application that relies in part on clinical data to disclose certain financial arrangements between the sponsor
and its clinical investigators and certain interests of the clinical investigators in the product or in the sponsor.
FDA will use this information, in conjunction with information about the design and purpose of the study, as well as
information obtained through on-site inspections, in the agency's assessment of the reliability of the data.

For the purposes of this part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compensation affected by the outcome of clinical studies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means compensation that could be higher for a favorable outcome than for an unfavorable outcome, such as compensation
explicitly greater in the event of a favorable result, or compensation to the investigator in the form of an equity
interest in the sponsor's company or in the form of compensation tied to sales of the product, such as a royalty interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant equity interest in the applicant means 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through
reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a publicly traded corporation that exceeds 5 percent of total
equity.

 means any study involving human subjects, including a study to establish bioavailability or bioequivalence, submitted
in a marketing application subject to this part, that either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The sponsor identifies as one that the sponsor relies on to establish that the product meets the regulatory requirements
for marketing, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) FDA identifies as one that it intends to rely on to support its decision to permit the marketing of the product. Studies
submitted as publications or in brief summary form will generally not be considered ``covered clinical studies''
unless FDA informs the sponsor otherwise. A sponsor may consult with FDA as to which clinical studies constitute ``covered
clinical studies'' for purposes of complying with financial disclosure requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant payments of other sorts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means payments that exceed $5,000 (e.g., grants to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment or
retainers for ongoing consultation or honoraria) or that exceed 5 percent of the total equity in a publicly held and
widely traded company.

Scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements in this part apply to any sponsor of human drugs, biological products, or devices who has contracted

For purposes of this part, a sponsor must submit a list of all clinical investigators who conducted studies to determine
whether the sponsor's product meets FDA marketing requirements, identifying those clinical investigators who
are full-time employees of the sponsor. The sponsor must also completely and accurately disclose or certify information
concerning the financial interests of a clinical investigator who is not a full-time employee of the sponsor, and
the investigator's spouse and dependent children for each covered clinical study. The clinical investigator must
provide the sponsor with sufficient accurate information to make the required disclosure or certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The sponsor of an application submitted under sections 505, 506, 507, 510(k), 513, or 515 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act that relies in part on clinical studies shall submit,
for each covered clinical study, either a certification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a disclosure
statement described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to all covered clinical studies [or to specific clinical studies listed below] submitted in support
of this application, I certify that (name of applicant) has not entered into any financial arrangement with any clinical
investigator, whereby the value of compensation to the investigator to conduct the study could be affected by the
outcome of the study. I also certify that each clinical investigator was required to disclose to (name of applicant)
whether the investigator had a proprietary interest in this product, or a significant equity interest in (name of
applicant), and that no such interests were disclosed. I further certify that the investigator was not the recipient
of significant payments of other kinds as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(f). For purposes of this statement, a clinical investigator

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For any application containing a covered clinical study for which the sponsor does not submit the certification described
in &sect;54.4(a)(1), the application shall contain a statement disclosing, completely and accurately, the following
information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any financial arrangement entered into between the applicant and any clinical investigator involved in the conduct
of a covered clinical trial, whereby the value of the compensation to the clinical investigator to conduct the study

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation of disclosure statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA will evaluate the information disclosed under &sect;54.4(a)(2) about each covered clinical study in an application
to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests on the reliability of the study. FDA may consider both
the size and nature of a disclosed financial interest (including the potential increase in the value of the interest
if the product is approved) and steps that have been taken to minimize the potential for bias. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of study design. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing the potential of an investigator's financial interests to bias a study, FDA will take into account the
design and purpose of the study. Study designs that utilize multiple investigators (most of whom do not have a disclosable
interest), blinding, objective endpoints, or measurement of endpoints by someone other than the investigator may
adequately protect against any bias created by a disclosable financial interest.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for a proposal
to implement connected projects for the purpose of speeding recovery of the Thunder Mountain Fire burned area. Forest
Service proposed projects includes: Timber sale of dead and fire damaged trees within the fire perimeter; rehabilitation
of riparian areas and channels damaged by fire; and control of livestock to maintain pre-fire pristine character
of streams and meadows. The EIS will develop and evaluate a range of alternatives for management of the resources within
the fire perimeter. The alternatives will include a no action alternative, involving no timber harvest or road construction,
and additional alternatives in response to issues identified during the scoping process. The proposed projects
are consistent with the direction in the 1989 Okanogan National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest
Plan) which provides the overall guidance for management of the area. The entire burned area and proposed project
are within the Long Swamp Roadless Area. Implementation of proposed projects is scheduled for Fiscal Year 1995. The
Long Swamp Roadless Area is located approximately 25 miles west of Tonasket, Washington. The agency invites written
comments on the scope of this project. In addition, the agency gives notice of this analysis so that interested and
affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the decision making process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Thunder Mountain Fire was started by lightning on July 23, 1994 and was not declared controlled until August 30.
During that time, the fire burned through 8,950 acres of lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir forest.
Within the fire perimeter, it is estimated that approximately 4,500 acres of trees were killed by the flames and heat
of the fire. The remainder of the area within the fire perimeter either burned to a lesser degree (and may experience
further dying of trees) or did not burn at all. Fire control was hampered by the roadless nature of the area which limited
access.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is to salvage dead and fire damaged trees on approximately 25 percent of the area within the fire
perimeter. Approximately half of the area to be salvaged will be logged using helicopter yarding and the other half
will be logged using cable and tractor systems. Approximately 3 miles of road will be constructed to improve access
to the center of the area. The roads would be on three or four ridgetops running west from the main road in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This area has recently been analyzed in both the Meadows Integrated Resource Analysis, which concentrated on issues
associated with management of North American lynx, and the Chewuch Watershed Analysis, which analyzed historical
disturbance patterns and how existing resource conditions differ from historical conditions. To date, the major
issues identified are: Management of the roadless area; effects on lynx habitat; effects on anadromous fish habitat
within the Chewuch River; future fire risk; and long term health of the soils and water within the burned area. Public
meetings will be held in Tonasket and the Methow Valley (Washington) to review existing information and facilitate
public scoping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EIS will tier to the Forest Plan, as amended by the Eastside Screening Environmental Assessment. The Forest Plan
provides forest-wide standards and guidelines, management area standards and guidelines, and desired future conditions
for the various lands on the Forest. This direction is provided for management practices that will be utilized during
the implementation of the Forest Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Thunder Analysis Area contains about 8,950 acres. All of this is in the Long Swamp Roadless Area, which is 70,200
acres in size. The Analysis Area is allocated to the following Management Areas (MA):

The analysis will develop a range of alternatives_from no-action, (with no timber harvest or road construction)
to an alternative that proposes harvest (no road construction), to an alternative that considers timber harvest
with road construction and a lesser amount of helicopter yarding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The Forest Service will
be seeking information, comments, and assistance from other Federal, State, local agencies, and tribes, and other
individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed project. This input will be used
in preparation of the draft EIS. the scoping process includes:

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by December, 1994. Your comments and suggestions are encouraged and should be in writing. The comment period
on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice of this early stage of public participation and
of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers
of draft EIS must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can be meaningfully considered and responded to in the final
EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 6, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of its administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand. The review covers one exporter, the New Zealand
Kiwifruit Marketing Board (NZKMB), and the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993. Based on our analysis of
the comments received, we determine the dumping margin for NZKMB to be 15.41 percent.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 6, 1994, the Department published the preliminary results (59 FR 23691) of its administrative review of the
antidumping duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand (57 FR 23203, (June 2, 1992)). The Department has now completed
this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).

Scope of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product covered by the order under review is fresh kiwifruit. Processed kiwifruit, including fruit jams, jellies,
pastes, purees, mineral waters, or juices made from or containing kiwifruit, are not covered under the scope of the
order. The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheading 0810.90.20.60 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this review is dispositive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. At the request of respondent, NZKMB, we held
a public hearing on June 20, 1994. We received timely comments from respondent and petitioners, the California Kiwifruit
Commission (CKC).

interest NZKMB incurred as a result of the duty deposits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that this interest is not ``dumping duty interest'', but rather that it is simply interest incurred
by respondent on short-term commercial bank financing to finance kiwifruit business operations. Furthermore,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with respondent. Respondent mischaracterized the Department's verification of this expense. The Department
only verified the total interest expense for NZKMB. NZKMB did not provide any supporting documentation for specific
interest on dumping deposits (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Department's verification report for NZKMB, dated April 16, 1994, pp. 14&hyph;15). Given the Department's inability
to verify the interest incurred for dumping deposits, there is no evidentiary basis for making the adjustment claimed
by respondent. Therefore, the issue of the Department's practice in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses should be reduced by revenues from sales
of salvaged packaging, which were posted to two accounts in NZKMB's general ledger. Respondent contends that the
Department verified the items in one account and declined to examine the second account, citing lack of time. Furthermore,
respondent claims that the Department traced the total amount in the second account to the general ledger and that
the Department's unwillingness to go behind the ledger for this account is not sufficient grounds to doubt its accuracy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The Department informed respondent, prior to verification, in a letter dated March 4, 1994, that ``it
is the responsibility of the respondent to be fully prepared for the verification. If (respondent) is not prepared
to support or explain a response item at the appropriate time, we will move on to another topic. Due to time constraints,
it may not be possible to return to that item and we may consider the item unverified.'' Respondent did not bring its
claim for the adjustments in question to the Department's attention prior to the start of verification. In fact, these
adjustments were first brought to the Department's attention on the third day of a five-day verification. Due to respondent's
considerable delay in bringing the information to the Department's attention and subsequent lack of preparation
in providing the supporting documentation, the verification team was only able to verify fully the amount reported
for tender revenue packaging. The Department was unable to verify fully the amount reported in the sundry on-shore
packaging account because of respondent's inability to provide supporting documentation in a timely manner. Accordingly,
no adjustment has been made to G&amp;A for the sundry on-shore packaging in the final results.

Comment 3

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the Department should add the delivery premium for sales in the United States to the U.S. price
rather than deduct it from U.S. price. NZKMB asserts that it charges a delivery premium for sales in the United States
made on a delivered basis. This amount is charged to the customer as a premium above the gross unit price. Thus, according
to respondent, it should be added to the gross unit price to yield the actual price paid by the customer.

We agree with respondent that the delivery premium should not be subtracted from the gross price when calculating
the net U.S. price and have added it to the gross unit price so that our calculations reflect the full price paid by the
customer. We then have adjusted the U.S. price for actual movement expenses respondent incurred.

Comment 5
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent contends that the Department improperly treated interest expenses by including the growers' interest
cost in the cost of manufacture (COM) rather than accounting for it as a general expense in accordance with the Department's
practice. To remedy this alleged error, respondent suggests that the Department subtract the growers' interest
from COM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, respondent contends that, when calculating the constructed value (CV) interest expense, the Department
double-counted the growers' interest by including it both in grower's COM and in CV interest expense calculation
for NZKMB. According to respondent, the amount reported as CV interest expense in NZKMB's response to the Department's
grower cost questionnaire, represents the total interest expense, for both NZKMB and the growers, that should be
added to CV. Respondent suggests correcting this alleged error by subtracting the grower interest from COM and multiplying
the result with CV offset proposed by NZKMB in its response to the Department's questionnaire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contest respondent's claim that the growers' interest expense should not be included in the COM but rather
should be accounted for as a general expense. Petitioners note that respondent's claim overlooks the distinction
between NZKMB's and growers' costs. Petitioners point out that the interest expenses incurred by each grower are
directly related to the kiwifruit operations for each grower and that the loans relate directly to individual growers'
costs of cultivation and are not ``general'' in nature nor are they a general expense of NZKMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners also dispute respondent's claim that the interest expense reported in NZKMB's response to the Department's
grower cost questionnaire represents the total interest, for both NZKMB and the growers, that should be added to CV.
According to petitioners, the amount for CV interest expense used by the Department is much less than the actual interest
incurred by either the growers or NZKMB because of an offset of interest expense with interest income that was not related
to the grower interest. Petitioners argue that the Department should not allow any offset to growers' interest expense.
Instead, petitioners argue that any offset that the Department chooses to make should only be subtracted from the
interest expense of NZKMB. Furthermore, petitioners maintain that this offset should be in the form of a whole number
instead of an estimated ratio used by respondent in its response.

DOC Position
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree, in part, with both respondent and petitioners. We disagree with respondent's first argument that the growers'
interest cost should be excluded from the COM. The Department's objective is to calculate the cost of production (COP)
of the subject merchandise sold by NZKMB. This COP includes the cost incurred by the grower to produce the kiwifruit
as well as the selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) incurred by NZKMB to sell the kiwifruit. The
financial expenses incurred by growers are a part of the costs associated with producing the kiwifruit. That is, these
financial expenses are directly related to individual growers' COM and are not NZKMB's general expense. NZKMB's
financial expense is treated as the general expense of NZKMB and added to the grower's COM to arrive at the total COP
of the kiwifruit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to respondent's argument that the Department double-counted growers' interest expenses, the Department
agrees with respondent in part. We agree with respondent that the Department double-counted the growers' interest
by including it both in grower's COM and in CV interest expense calculation for NZKMB. However, we disagree with the
specific amount of the CV offset proposed by respondent. The CV offset proposed by respondent is a percentage factor
that is applied to total interest of growers and NZKMB which was adjusted for deposits made for estimated antidumping
duties. We have recalculated respondent's proposed adjustment by disallowing respondent's deduction for the interest
incurred on its duty deposits. (For an explanation of the Department's position on this issue, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 1.) Furthermore, we have allowed this offset only to NZKMB's financial expenses because, as noted above,
the Department does not consider financial expenses incurred by growers to be a general expense of NZKMB.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent contends that the Department's treatment of orchard set-up costs for growers who purchased already-
established orchards and thus did not report actual orchard set-up costs has unfairly distorted and inflated costs.
Respondent argues that the Department's decision to use the best information available (BIA) for these orchards
set-up costs grossly exaggerates their value. Respondent maintains that a purchaser of an established orchard does
not bear directly any set-up costs, since those costs were borne by the original establisher of the orchard. Respondent
asserts that a purchaser's total cost for an orchard is the price the purchaser paid to the seller of the property and
that a portion of that purchase price attributable to capital improvements is effectively the purchaser's set-up
cost. That is, respondent contends, the difference in value between the raw land and the land with an established orchard
represents the value to the purchaser of the set-up costs incurred by the original owner. Moreover, respondent points
out that for most growers the Department has valued the set-up cost of the orchard at more than the price paid for the
entire farm. Respondent notes that growers reported the actual amortized value of the orchard based on their purchase
prices for the land and the orchard. Respondent contends that this reporting methodology was obtained from land valuation
reports prepared by private appraisers and was not challenged by the Department in its supplemental questionnaire.
Furthermore, respondent maintains that it is not clear what facts or information the Department believes were withheld
by those growers who, in the Department's view, failed to provide actual set-up costs as those growers could not report
``actual'' set-up costs given that they did not incur any such costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contest respondent's assertion that the Department ought to adopt a ``purchase price'' methodology
for deriving the orchard set-up costs for growers who purchased already established orchards. Petitioners argue
that the fact that a reasonable imputed set-up cost for some of these farms meets or exceeds their recent purchase price
simply demonstrates that kiwifruit properties in New Zealand are depressed. Furthermore, petitioners maintain
that the purchase price of these farms does not represent the costs of developing the kiwifruit operation. According
to petitioners, respondent ignores the fact that set-up costs are allocated over the useful life of the orchard and
that allocation of a purchase price established after the set-up period would understate actual set-up costs for
a kiwifruit orchard by allowing allocation of a mere ``remnant value'' to be substituted for the actual set-up costs.
Petitioners agree with the Department's decision to apply BIA to reflect the set-up costs associated with kiwifruit
production.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For those growers who purchased already-established orchards in an arm's-length transaction, we agree with respondent
that their ``set-up'' cost is the portion of the price paid for the orchard that is attributable to ``capital improvements''.
That is, the ``set-up'' costs for these orchards is the difference in value between the raw land and the land with an
established orchard on it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When conducting the test for sales below the COP, we are concerned with the COP for the merchandise sold during the POR.
The fact that the prevailing prices for kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand are depressed is irrelevant. What is relevant
in our COP analysis are the costs incurred by growers to produce the fruit sold during the POR. Therefore, we agree with
respondent that the price a grower paid for an orchard's ``capital improvements'' is effectively the equivalent
of ``set-up'' costs for growers who purchased already-established orchards. Accordingly, we have revised the ``set-up''
costs for Growers' 1, 3, 5, and 19 in these final results.

Comment 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the Department's use of a 20-year amortization period for orchard set-up costs is entirely
unsupported and that the Department should instead use a 35-year amortization period. Respondent cites excerpts
from various studies conducted in New Zealand to support its claim that the useful life of kiwifruit orchards in New
Zealand is at least 35 years. Furthermore, respondent asserts that the Department's staff refused to discuss this
issue at verification and would not accept any offers to back up or otherwise verify the accuracy of the 35-year productive
life. Respondent also asserts that the document relied on by the Department in the original investigation to support
the 20-year productive life does not make the 20-year estimate with conviction nor does it claim to be based on scientific
study. Respondent maintains that the document was only a guess since it was based on commercial experience in California
which at the time of writing in 1989 had just recently been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners argue that respondent has not offered new support for a period longer than 20 years. According to petitioners,
the possibility that the respondent was prepared to show the Department's verifiers a New Zealand vineyard older
than 20 years is not dispositive of the issue because one, two, or even 20 farms with old vines cannot refute the fact
that nearly every commercially producing kiwifruit vineyard in New Zealand and in other countries is less than 20
years old.

DOC Position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with petitioners. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) call for the amortization and recovery
of costs over the expected productive life of an asset. The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which
the asset may reasonably be expected to be useful to the individual's business or to the production of income. Some
of the factors to be considered in determining this period are (1) wear and tear and decay or decline from natural causes,
(2) economic changes and current developments within the industry or business, and (3) the climatic and other local
conditions peculiar to the individual's business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information submitted by respondent in support of useful vine life does not refute the Department's 20-year estimate
in the preliminary results. The excerpts from studies cited by respondent do not provide any conclusive evidence
in support of respondent's claim for a 35-year or longer productive life. In fact, a letter from the Horticultural
and Food Research Institute of New Zealand, Ltd. (HORT), submitted by respondent, states that ``the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries (MAF) surveys indicate that before about 1970, there were insignificant plantings of kiwifruit_this
means that in New Zealand there are very few plants more than 20&hyph;25 years old. *&blank;*&blank;*'' During verification
in New Zealand, the Department discovered that, because of low profitability, some of the growers in the Department's
sample had either pulled out or were contemplating pulling out their kiwifruit vines to use the land for other purposes.
Furthermore, respondent's argument that it was prepared to show the Department's verifiers a New Zealand vineyard
older than 20 years is not conclusive because the Department's objective is to measure an average useful life and not
the useful life of one or two farms. Therefore, we maintain our position that the expected productive life of a kiwifruit
orchard is 20 years.

Comment 8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the Department's methodology of allocating orchard costs to headlands and sidelands is flawed
because the Department allocated headlands and sidelands only to kiwifruit crops, even though other fruit orchards
also have associated headlands and sidelands. Respondent contends that the shelter-belt and sidelands are an integral
part of all the orchard crops, not just of kiwifruit. Furthermore, respondent argues that the Department should not
include headlands and sidelands in the allocation formula because the net area of the orchard is the area that is the
focus of horticultural expenses. Although shelterbelts are occasionally trimmed and headlands and sidelands are
mowed and sprayed for bugs, according to respondent, these costs are trivial. Respondent further contends that the
Department's methodology of allocating costs to headlands and sidelands by using Grower 4 as an example is flawed
because Grower 4's headlands and sidelands are only allocated to kiwifruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners argue that headlands, sidelands, and windbreaks are not required for all fruit orchards. Petitioners
note, however, that they are crucial for kiwifruit orchards because kiwifruit vines are much more sensitive to severe
weather than are other crops. Furthermore, petitioners note that the support systems on which kiwifruit vines grow
are also more sensitive to weather conditions than are other more deeply rooted orchard crops. According to petitioners,
respondent is wrong to question the Department's use of Grower 4 as an example for allocation of costs to headlands
and sidelands because respondent's submission did not provide any information about headlands or sidelands for
Grower 4's passionfruit canopy and no support was forwarded that showed that headlands and sidelands were an integral
part of the grower's passionfruit crop. Petitioners further contend that contrary to respondent's contention,
aerial photographs submitted by respondents for Growers 10 and 17 do not show that crops other than kiwifruit crops
require shelter belts. Petitioners additionally contend that respondent's attempt to demonstrate that the Department
misallocated headlands and sidelands is inconclusive. For Grower 8, for example, petitioners argue that respondent
admits in its own submission that the headlands and sidelands are devoted only to kiwifruit by attributing the extra
area to the kiwifruit orchards. Finally, petitioners maintain that while the headlands and sidelands are not themselves
productive, these areas are nonetheless integral to the successful growth and production of kiwifruit and are therefore
appropriately accounted for in the cost of producing kiwifruit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree, in part, with both petitioners and respondent. Costs, such as fertilizer expenses, that are solely applicable
to kiwifruit or to another crop's canopy area should be allocated on the basis of productive area only. However, by
respondent's own admission, there are certain costs, such as trimming, mowing, spraying, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
etc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, involved in the maintenance of shelterbelts, headlands, and sidelands. These costs should be allocated over the
gross kiwifruit area. Accordingly, we have adjusted our COP calculations in the final results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to respondent's comment that headlands and sidelands were allocated to kiwifruit only, the Department
imputed the area for headlands and sidelands only for those growers for whom respondent did not provide the actual
breakdown between the canopy and the gross area for various crops and where it was not clear from the record whether
crops other than kiwifruit had shelterbelts, headlands, and sidelands around them. Therefore, no adjustment for
orchard area has been made.

of the land from orchard cost allocation because pastoral activities are an integral part of the growers' operations

We agree with petitioners in part. While pasture land requires little or no labor, it may require management and vehicle-related

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the Department's treatment of intra-family interest and salary and other related-party
expenses in the preliminary results is inconsistent and in error. Respondent contends that it has been the Department's
practice to treat transactions between related parties as unreliable and to examine costs to a company as a whole and
eliminate intra-company payments and transfers. Respondent argues that the kiwifruit growers' accounting is typical
of a small business in that it is essentially tax driven. In particular, respondent argues that recharacterizing
grower profits as interest payments and inflated salaries paid to family members are typical methods used to cut taxes.
Respondent cites Growers 5, 7, 17, and 19 as examples of this practice. Respondent uses Grower 17 for analysis purposes
and argues that the wages paid by the grower to his spouse are a paper transaction only and that his spouse is not in fact
a farm hand. Similarly, respondent argues that the loan from Grower 17's spouse to the grower was a paper transaction
to reduce taxes in which the wife pretended to loan her husband money and the husband pretended to pay his wife interest.
Respondent applies the same argument to salary payments made to the son of Grower 19 and asserts that this is a profit
distribution among family members. Respondent further argues that, for Grower 8, the Department should exclude
interest that the owners paid themselves from the COP calculation because it was a distribution of profits to the owners.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners argue that respondent has furnished no evidence of New Zealand tax provisions to support its claim that
the inflated payments are reported for tax purposes. Petitioners argue that the Department should not accept respondent's
claim that some of the expenses are not real expenses when nothing in the record demonstrates this claim to be true.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent argues that the Department incorrectly disallowed the rental income credit reported by Growers 8, 13,
and 18. Respondent contends that these growers reported imputed rental income as a credit against their reported
labor cost because each of these growers provided housing to their orchard employees. According to respondent, under
New Zealand income tax law, employer-provided housing is considered a taxable benefit to the employee. As a result,
the grower that provides housing is required, when submitting its tax information, to increase the reported salary
paid in cash to the employee by the imputed value of the housing benefit. Respondent explains that, because of this
calculation, the growers' income statement reflects a total labor cost that includes both the wages actually paid
to employees, the imputed value of the housing benefit, and the growers' actual expenses incurred in providing employee
housing. Respondent contends that this imputed housing value is not an additional expense to the grower. Respondent
maintains that the Department misunderstood the nature of the housing expense and included both the imputed value
of the housing benefit and the actual housing expenses incurred by the grower. Respondent argues that the Department
erred in its COP calculations when it disallowed the offsetting credit amount reported in growers' financial statements
to correct the employer's overstatement for employee housing expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that the rental income credit is inappropriate because housing rental is not a farm operation.

We agree with respondent. In this case, the growers provide a housing benefit to employees. Under the New Zealand tax
laws, this housing benefit is considered a taxable benefit to the employees and its imputed value is reflected on the
employees' income statements along with total wages. Although the growers' income statements reflect a total labor
cost that includes both the wages actually paid to employees and the imputed value of the housing benefit, the imputed
housing value is not an additional expense to the growers; the actual cost of the housing benefit, such as depreciation,
maintenance, electricity,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is already included in the growers' financial statements. Since the growers' financial statements show an expense
for the imputed housing benefit that was not incurred, the growers offset this expense with ``rental income'' to reconcile
their financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To include the imputed housing value plus the growers' actual expenses incurred in providing the housing benefit
in the COP calculation would result in double-counting the total expenses for the housing. Accordingly, we have accepted
this ``rental income'' credit adjustment reported by respondent for Growers 8, 13, and 18 in the final results.

Petitioners argue that, in its calculation of respondent's COP of kiwifruit sold in Japan, the Department failed

that the New Zealand coolstore cost should be included in the COP because these costs were included in net prices. Since
this coolstore expense is a part of NZKMB's G&amp;A expense, however, it is already a factor in our analysis. Therefore,
we made no further adjustment for this expense in our COP analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that the methodology used by respondent to impute expenses grossly understated the labor costs.
Respondent reported labor in three categories: ``labor'', ``imputed labor'', and ``contracted labor''. Petitioners
allege that these disparate labor expense reporting practices resulted in a fractured, often unidentifiable, labor
component. Petitioners request that the Department reject respondent's reported labor expenses and replace them
with costs derived in a more logical fashion. Petitioners contend that actual kiwifruit labor costs should be determined
from the responses for five growers only, based on the following factors: (1) the grower produced kiwifruit only,
or the grower's kiwifruit labor costs are segregable; (2) the grower needed to impute no labor cost; (3) labor cost
was not consolidated with materials; or (4) labor cost was easily identifiable. Petitioners argue that Growers 2,
7, 13, 14, and 20 satisfied the above conditions. Furthermore, petitioners assert that an analysis of these growers'
labor cost shows that labor cost per hectare decreases as the area under cultivation increases. Thus, petitioners
argue that the Department should impute labor costs according to the following ``surrogate'' matches: Grower 13
as surrogate for Grower 12; Grower 7 as surrogate for Growers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Petitioners
argue that to calculate the imputed labor cost for these 15 growers, the Department should simply multiply the growers'
kiwifruit canopy hectares by the per-hectare labor cost of the surrogate grower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent argues that since the growers have reported their actual labor and contracted labor expenses and have
added imputed labor expenses for family labor, there is no basis for adding additional labor costs to growers who relied
more heavily on contracted labor.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with respondent. For most growers, contracted labor expenses reported by respondent include labor and material
costs. In instances where labor was not contracted for, the labor was provided either by an employee, by the owner himself,
or by the owner's family. In the case of growers who used family labor, an imputed expense for family labor was reported
and included in the COP. Additionally, for some growers labor costs were included in direct materials such as spraying
and fertilizer. Therefore, we accepted respondent's labor cost allocation as an appropriate estimation of the cost
of cultivating kiwifruit and used the information in our COP analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that interest expenses should be allocated on the basis of cost of goods sold, rather than on the
basis of assets, because respondent has not demonstrated linkage between the growers' assets and the interest incurred
by the growers. Furthermore, petitioners contend that interest relates not to assets, but to the business operations
of the orchards. According to petitioners, this is demonstrated by the fact that of the 20 growers, 11 were unprofitable
in their kiwifruit operations during the POR, five were profitable on kiwifruit operations, and it was not possible
to tell for the remaining four whether kiwifruit operations were profitable. Petitioners contend that based on these
grounds, the interest incurred by these growers must be associated with financing the operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent claims that interest expenses should be allocated on the basis of asset value and not on the basis of cost
of goods sold. Respondent argues that the Department has allocated interest on the basis of cost of sales in a typical
proceeding involving a manufacturing company with multiple products because it has been assumed that each of the
consolidated lines of business of a respondent have approximately equal operating asset requirements. Respondent
asserts that where that assumption of equivalent assets is not true in a particular case, the Department uses asset-based
allocation as was done in the antidumping investigations of

We agree with respondent but not for the reasons stated. During verification in New Zealand, the Department observed
that many kiwifruit growers reside on their farms. In most cases, these growers' financial statements list their
private residence as well as orchard-related expenses together. However, during verification, the Department
observed that the growers' private residences are not directly related to the cultivation of kiwifruit. Since a grower's
residence does not generate a cost of sales, the allocation of interest on the basis of cost of sales would not accurately
reflect the amount of interest attributable specifically to the residence of orchard operation. Therefore, we have
accepted respondent's methodology of allocating interest expense on the basis of asset value, thus distinguishing
between interest expenses attributable to the growers' residence and those attributable to their commercial activities.
Accordingly, no adjustment for Growers' 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 20 has been made in the final results.

Petitioners disagree with respondent's methodology of allocating G&amp;A expenses for Growers' 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 16,
17, and 20. Petitioners contend that, by using a cost of goods sold ratio based on the kiwifruit COM relative to all other
costs, respondent has understated kiwifruit costs and has overstated the total orchard costs. Furthermore, petitioners
argue that kiwifruit picking and packing expense should be included in the cost of goods sold. Petitioners urge the
Department to recalculate growers' G&amp;A expenses by adding the amount of picking and packing in the total cost
of sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent argues that petitioners' proposal to reallocate G&amp;A expenses by including packing in the COM is without
merit. Respondent notes that it is the Department's practice to exclude packing from the COM for the allocation of
G&amp;A. Furthermore, respondent contends that it used unpacked COM to allocate among all orchard crops. Therefore,
if the Department were to include the cost of packing for allocation purposes in the cost of kiwifruit only, but not
for other crops, the results would be biased. Respondent argues that while the growers ultimately pay for packing,
NZKMB administers the packing and distribution of kiwifruit from the time it leaves the orchard. Therefore, NZKMB
is responsible for the packing process and NZKMB has included its G&amp;A expenses in the COP figures for the kiwifruit.

We disagree with petitioners that respondent understated kiwifruit costs and overstated the total orchard costs
by using a cost of goods sold ratio based on the kiwifruit COM relative to all other costs. Where growers had multiple
crops, respondent allocated costs between kiwifruit and other crops. Since respondent used the unpacked COM to allocate
costs among all orchard crops, inclusion of packing cost for allocation purposes in the cost of kiwifruit and not for
other crops would prejudice the results. Therefore, we have accepted respondent's methodology in these final results.

We agree with respondent that normally the Department does not consider packing expense as part of COM for the allocation
of G&amp;A. Therefore, we have accepted respondent's treatment of the packing expense.

We agree with petitioners in part. Because headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts require regular pruning and maintenance,
certain expenses such as pruning, shelter, and labor should be allocated on the basis of gross kiwifruit area. However,
we disagree with petitioners about the allocation of fertilizer and pollination expenses. The fertilizer and pollination
expenses are not applicable to headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts, hence, we have allocated these expenses
over the productive area only for the final results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Petitioners argue that as a result of respondent's deduction of picking and packing expenses from the COM, the calculation
of this grower's total cost of goods sold is erroneous. Furthermore, petitioners contend that the costs added by respondent
for the value of animal stock sold, shearing wages, management, farm working expenses, repairs and maintenance,
depreciation, rates (property taxes) and vehicle expense are in error because the value of animal stock sold as described
in the grower's submission does not represent actual costs of producing the goat, deer and sheep stock sold. According
to petitioners, respondent's inclusion of these values resulted in grossly overstated total costs. Petitioners
assert that, if these values are included, the ``value'' of the kiwifruit plantation should also be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent argues that neither the value of the livestock retained, and not sold, nor the value of the orchard are included
in the cost of sales it provided to the Department. Thus, respondent asserts that petitioners' argument that the value
of the unsold orchard should be included in the allocation is without merit. Furthermore, respondent contends that
petitioners' argument is factually unsound because U.S. GAAP governing the valuation of livestock held for sale
specifies that the value of the livestock is the acquisition price, if any, plus the cost of feed and other costs of maintaining
the livestock until sold. According to respondent, for tax reporting purposes in New Zealand, the principle is the
same: the cost of sales is the cost of developing (i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 raising) the livestock. Respondent further contends that each year the New Zealand Inland Revenue, the tax authority
in New Zealand, publishes a schedule which specifies the expected cost of developing livestock. Respondent maintains
that this schedule is specific with respect to breed, sex, and maturity, and that it is this value that respondent used
in its response. Respondent argues that the Department normally accepts the accounting principles of the respondent's
home country, and that in the case of this grower the accounting principle is the same as that used in the United States.
Therefore, respondent argues that the Department should use the cost as reported by respondent in the allocation
of G&amp;A as it was based on New Zealand GAAP and reasonably reflects actual cost.

the respondent to review the list of sampled growers and ``determine (1) whether any of these growers is related to

have been consolidated, we may have to resort to the best information available as required by section 776(b) of the
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, in determining the cost for that particular farm for the purpose of establishing the

At verification, the Department, in a random review of invoices for this grower, noted an invoice which was made out
in the name of an orchard that had not been reported to the Department. The grower claimed at that time that the orchard
listed on the invoice was the orchard that had been reported as sold. The Grower's records did not support this claim.
The name of the sold orchard was not identified in the grower's response; only the MAF number was listed. Grower 2's
records reviewed at verification showed the name of the orchard with the MAF number reported as sold; that name was
different than the name listed on the invoice. By way of explanation, the grower claimed that the orchard operated
under two different names, but offered no evidence to support that claim. Furthermore, our review of NZKMB records
did not support the grower's claim. The NZKMB records for the orchard listed on the invoice showed Grower 2 as the owner
and listed a different MAF number than the one reported by Grower 2 for the sold orchard. Thus, neither the grower's
records nor the NZKMB records supported Grower 2's claim that the orchard listed on the invoice and the orchard sold
are one and the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Department could not verify the Grower's claim, we concluded that the related orchard on the invoice was
not reported to the Department. By failing to report all related orchards, the grower failed to report all relevant
costs. Thus, we have maintained our application of BIA for Grower 2. In light of the Department's determination to
use BIA regarding this grower, we need not address respondent's allegation regarding management and interest expenses.

We disagree. According to this grower's response, summer and winter pruning was performed by the owner who worked
part-time on the orchard. Respondent computed the cost of pruning for the two sampled growers in the Bay of Plenty region
who had contracted out for pruning and based on their cost imputed the cost of pruning for this grower. Without a more

Petitioners argue that this grower's allocations of certain direct and indirect costs to kiwifruit based on the ratio
of kiwifruit canopy area to total cultivated area or on the percentage of kiwifruit revenue of the grower's total revenue
are flawed. Furthermore, petitioners support the Department's decision to recalculate expenses based on the ratio
of total kiwifruit area to total cultivated area in the preliminary results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent argues that the Department allocated farm expenses among the grower's various crops incorrectly by allocating

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree, in part, with petitioners' argument regarding allocation of costs between canopy and non-productive areas.
Costs, such as fertilizers, that are directly applicable to the canopy area only, should be allocated exclusively
to productive areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

over the gross kiwifruit area. Accordingly, we have made an adjustment to the fertilizer expenses for this grower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding respondent's argument that the Department ignored headlands and sidelands surrounding the passionfruit
orchard, because the respondent did not provide an exact breakdown among headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts
for either kiwifruit or passionfruit, the Department decided to impute the area devoted to headlands, sidelands,
and shelterbelts for cost allocation purposes. Furthermore, we could not firmly establish from this grower's response
whether shelterbelts, headlands, and sidelands were also applicable to the passionfruit crop. Therefore, we imputed
shelterbelts, headlands, and sidelands for kiwifruit only.

Petitioners note that, although the Department's preliminary analysis memorandum discusses a recalculation of
this grower's rates expense, the Department used in its calculations the expense as reported. Petitioners urge the
Department to use the amount calculated in the preliminary analysis memorandum, since this figure more accurately
captures the rates expense.

Petitioners argue that the Department should reject the contracted labor income offset claimed in the labor expense

We agree with petitioners in part. As a result of verification in New Zealand, the Department has determined that the
contracted income was an appropriate offset against grower's labor costs because contract income included an element
of labor cost which was also included in the grower's total labor costs. The disallowance of this offset would result
in the inclusion of labor costs unrelated to this grower's production costs of its own kiwifruit crop. However, we
agree with petitioners that the contracted labor income should be adjusted for overhead and profit. Accordingly,
we have adjusted the labor expense for this grower in the final results.

Petitioners argue that certain direct and indirect expenses for this grower should be recalculated because most

We disagree with petitioners. Respondent's methodology of allocating costs based on land area is an acceptable methodology
in this case. Although cattle were not fully introduced into the grower's operations before the kiwifruit harvest,
nevertheless, the grower incurred development costs during the POR that were related to the establishment of the

cost of cultivating kiwifruit. Accordingly, we have not adjusted respondent's figure for the final results.

With regard to petitioners' argument concerning the insurance premium, we disagree with petitioners because GAAP

We disagree. Since respondent did not provide an exact breakdown between canopy, shelterbelts, headlands, sidelands,

In addition, this grower's response to the Department's questionnaire indicated that the pasture area was leased
to another party. Headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts are crucial to growing kiwifruit. However, respondent
did not put forward any support that demonstrated that headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts are an integral part
of this grower's other crops. Without any contrary evidence on the record, the Department could only conclude that
the land area for headlands, sidelands, and shelterbelts applies solely to kiwifruit production.

With respect to petitioners argument regarding the resale price of the spray, the Department has made no adjustment

financial statement basis which includes corporate and orchard interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with respondent that gains on sales of assets are a proper inclusion in the G&amp;A expense and that the coolstore
rebate is a reduction in the packing cost paid to the packhouse/coolstore and, therefore, is properly included in
the COP.

Respondent contends that the Department failed to adjust NZKMB's interest expenses by the amount of interest NZKMB
earned on short-term deposits. Respondent asserts that the Department normally permits an offset of interest expenses
by short-term interest income, citing the

Respondent argues that in testing whether sales were made below cost, the Department inadvertently used a one-month
threshold, although the preliminary results indicated a threshold of ``more than two months.'' According to respondent,
the Department's practice in administrative reviews is to use a period of time greater than two months in implementing
19 CFR 353.51(a)(1), which allows the Department to disregard sales below cost in the calculation of FMV only if they
are made ``over an extended period'' of time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 23, 1993, Bitronic Telecoms Co., Ltd. (Bitronic), a manufacturer/exporter of SBTS from Taiwan, requested
that the Department conduct an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on SBTS from Taiwan covering the
period December 1, 1992 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1993. On January 18, 1994, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 2593) a notice of initiation of an administrative review of the order. This notice stated that we would review
this one manufacturer/exporter covering the period December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993. On May 19, 1994, Bitronic
requested that it be allowed to withdraw its request for a review and that the review be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations states that ``The Secretary may permit a party that requests
a review under paragraph (a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication
of notice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides
that it is reasonable to do so.'' Because no significant work has yet been done in this review, we have determined that
it is reasonable to extend the 90-day time limit and to allow Bitronic to withdraw its request for review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As authorized by Section 2 of the Act of March 3, 1901 as amended (15 U.S.C. 272 (b)(2) and (c)(3)), NIST conducts directly,
and supports through grants, a basic and applied research program in the general area of precision measurement and
the determination of fundamental constants of nature. As part of this research program, NIST has since 1970 awarded
Precision Measurement Grants to scientists in U.S. academic institutions for significant, primarily experimental
research in the field of precision measurement and fundamental constants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Award Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NIST is now accepting applications for two new grants in the amount of $50,000 per year to be awarded for the period October
1, 1995, through September 30, 1996 (fiscal year 1996.) Each grant may be renewed for up to two additional years; however,
future or continued funding will be at the total discretion of NIST based on such factors as satisfactory performance
and the availability of funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Program Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NIST sponsors these grants to encourage basic, measurement-related research in U.S. colleges and universities
and to foster contacts between NIST scientists and those researchers in the U.S. academic community who are actively
engaged in such work. The Precision Measurement Grants are also intended to make it possible for workers in U.S. academic
institutions to pursue new measurement ideas for which other sources of support may be difficult to find.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Matching Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Precision Management Grants Program does not involve the payment of any matching funds and does not directly affect
any state or local government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Research Topics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There is considerable latitude in the kind of research projects that will be considered for support under the Precision
Measurement Grants Program. The key requirement is that they are consistent with NIST's mission in the field of basic
measurement science, for example:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Experimental and theoretical studies of fundamental physical phenomena to test the basic laws of physics or which
may lead to improved or new fundamental measurement methods and standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The determination of important fundamental physical constants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The development of new standards for physical measurement of the highest possible precision and accuracy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, proposals for experimental research will be given preference over proposals for theoretical research
because of the greater expense of experimental work. Proposals from workers at the assistant and associate professor
level who have some record of accomplishment are especially encouraged in view of the comparative difficulty aspiring
researchers have in obtaining funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typical projects which have been funded through the NIST Precision Measurement Grants Program include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Measurement of Fundamental Constants Using Three-Level Resonances in Hydrogen,'' Carl E. Wieman, University
of Michigan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Quantum Limited Measurement of a Harmonic Oscillator,'' William C. Oelfke, University of Central Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

University.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``E&ouml;tv&ouml;s Experiment-Cryogenic Version,'' D.F. Bartlett, University of Colorado.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``A Test of Local Lorentz Invariance Using Polarized 21Ne Nuclei,'' T.E. Chupp, Harvard University.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``A New Method to Search for an Electric dipole Moment of the Electron,'' L.R. Hunter, Amherst College.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``High Precision Timing of Millisecond Pulsars,'' D.R. Stinebring, Princeton University.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Selection Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To simplify the proposal writing and evaluation process, the following selection procedure will be used:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the abbreviated proposals, four to eight semifinalist candidates will be selected by the NIST Precision
Measurement Grants Committee and the Outside Review Committee to submit full proposals. The same committees will
evaluate the detailed proposals, and on the basis of their evaluation, the two grantees for fiscal year 1996 will be
selected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Evaluation Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The criteria to be used in evaluating the abbreviated proposals and final proposals include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Importance of the proposed research to science_does it have the potential of answering some currently pressing
questions or of opening up a whole new area of activity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The relationship of the proposed research to measurement science_is there a possibility that it will lead to a new
or improved fundamental measurement method, basic measurement unit, or physical standard? (Or to a better understanding
of important but already existing measurement methods, measurement units, or physical standards?)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The feasibility of the research_is it likely that significant progress can be made in a three year time period with
the funds and personnel available?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The past accomplishments of the applicant_is the quality of the research previously carried out by the prospective
grantee such that there is a high probability that the proposed research will be successfully carried out?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of these factors are given equal weight in the selection process.

The city of Wilson, North Carolina, has made application for a Clean Water Act, Department of the Army Section 404 permit,
to discharge fill material for the construction of a dam to impound water on Contentnea Creek, Wilson County, North
Carolina. The proposed dam would be located immediately downstream of the existing Buckhorn Reservoir dam and would
inundate the existing reservoir site. The existing reservoir is no longer adequate to meet the water supply needs
of the city of Wilson. The proposed reservoir would meet the projected water supply needs of the city for the next 50
years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction of the proposed dam and reservoir requires a Clean Water Act, Department of the Army Section 404 permit,
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed dam and reservoir would expand the existing municipal water supply reservoir. The proposed reservoir
would inundate a total of 2,303 acres, including the existing 740-acre Buckhorn Water Supply Reservoir, with a normal
pool at elevation 148 feet mean sea level, and provide a 29.0-million gallons per day safe yield of raw water for the
city water supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The DEIS is being prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,
as amended, and will address the project's relationship to all other applicable Federal and State laws and Executive
Orders. The DEIS will contain no designation of an alternative preferred by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The decision
on the Department of the Army section 404 permit application will be made with full consideration of the public interest
after the comment period on the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and the Section 404 public notice has
concluded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The scoping process has consisted of an interagency scoping meeting on November 6, 1990, to allow opportunity for
agencies to identify issues, studies needed, and alternatives to be addressed. In addition, a Draft Environmental
Assessment was sent to Federal and State agencies for review and comment on August 8, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The significant issues that will be addressed in the DEIS are the impacts of the proposed project on wetlands, fish
and wildlife habitat, endangered species, and the social and economic considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Fourteen alternatives to the proposed action are being evaluated including the no action alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The DEIS is currently scheduled for distribution to the public in November 1994 and the FEIS is scheduled for distribution
in June 1995.

Proposed floodwater retarding structures for the Coldwater River Watershed are an integral part of the overall or
system plan for the control of erosion, sediment, and flooding in the Coldwater River Watershed. The structures will
provide flood control storage to reduce peak flows on streams within this watershed system as well as serve as a sediment
basin and function in the control of head cutting or on some streams.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternatives.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed floodwater retarding structures represent one element of the systems approach used to analyze and recommend
solutions to the interrelated problems of flooding, sediment, and erosion control. Other elements of this system
solution include grade control structures, bank stabilization, debris basins, and land treatments that have been
evaluated in previous environmental documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is to construct a 150-foot high zoned earth embankment dam at the lower end of Roach Gulch, a dry
tributary to the Greybull River. The dam would be 1700 feet long with a 150-foot wide earth channel spillway on the left
abutment, and would be located primarily in the SW1/4SW1/4 of Section 23, T 51 N, R 98 W of Big Horn county. Water from
the Greybull River would be diverted by means of a gated structure and delivered to the reservoir area via a 6-mile supply
canal, some of which is existing. Water would be released from the dam back into the Greybull River by means of an 1100-foot
earth channel, providing late-season irrigation water for 25,000 acres in the lower Greybull Valley. The project
may provide secondary fishery benefits by providing winter minimum flows from the proposed dam and Upper and Lower
Sunshine Reservoirs. The Greybull River Valley is located in southern Park and Big Horn counties in northwest Wyoming,
approximately 25 miles southeast of Cody, Wyoming.

Alternatives being evaluated by the applicant include similar diversions into Blackstone Gulch or Rawhide Creek,
as well as the enlargement of Upper Sunshine Reservoir, an existing storage reservoir. Conservation of existing
water supplies, utilization of groundwater, as well as the ``no action'' alternative will be considered.

Need for Reauthorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parts C through H of the IDEA are authorized through fiscal year 1994. Reauthorization of those portions of the Act
provides an opportunity to consider improvements to the entire IDEA, including other portions of the Act, that would
strengthen the Federal effort to give every child a world-class education based on high standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Description of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part A of the IDEA includes the findings and purpose of the Act; definitions; authority for the Office of Special Education
Programs; provisions regarding State sovereign immunity; authority for the acquisition of equipment and construction
of facilities; requirements relating to the employment of individuals with disabilities; grants for the removal
of architectural barriers; regulatory provisions; and eligibility and administrative provisions applicable
to the discretionary programs authorized in section 618 of Part B and Parts C through G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part B authorizes two formula grant programs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Assistance to States for Education of Individuals with Disabilities program, which assists States in providing
special education and related services to children, aged 3 through 21 years, with disabilities; and (2) the Preschool
Grants for Children with Disabilities program, which provides additional funds to help States provide services
to children, aged 3 through 5 years, with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), the Administration proposed
that the Chapter 1 Handicapped program currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized under Title I of the ESEA be eliminated and all children with disabilities be served under the IDEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 618 of Part B includes requirements for the collection of data; requirements for an annual report on the progress
being made under the Act and the publication of proposed priorities; and authority for other activities relating
to implementation of the Act and national program information needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts C though G authorize a variety of discretionary research, demonstration, training, technical assistance,
and dissemination activities. Part C addresses the regional resource and Federal centers; services for deaf-blind
children and youth; early education for children, aged birth through 8 years, with disabilities; programs for children
with severe disabilities; postsecondary education; secondary education and transitional services for youth with
disabilities; and programs for children and youth with serious emotional disabilities. Part D addresses personnel
training; grants to State educational agencies and institutions for traineeships; parent training and information;
and the national clearinghouses on children and youth with disabilities, postsecondary education, and careers
in special education. Part E addresses research and related activities, including research and demonstration projects
in physical education and recreation. Part F addresses instructional media for individuals with disabilities,
including the program dealing with captioned films, television, descriptive video, and educational media. Part
G addresses technology, educational media, and materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part H authorizes the Grants for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities program, which provides Federal assistance
to help States develop and implement statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency
programs for early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. States
must serve all children aged birth through two years who: (1) Are experiencing developmental delays as measured by
appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures in one or more of the following areas: cognitive, physical, communication,
social, emotional, or adaptive development; or (2) have a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability
of resulting in developmental delay. ``Developmental delay'' is defined by each State. At their discretion, States
may also serve infants and toddlers who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention
services are not provided. To be eligible for funding, the statewide system must include the 13 minimum components
required by the statute and must be fully implemented.

Funds are distributed to States based on their proportionate share of birth-through-two-year olds in the general
population. No State, however, may receive less than one-half of one percent of the funds available to States. Under
the Administration's proposal to merge the Chapter 1 Handicapped program with the programs under the IDEA, States
would receive no less under the Grants for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program in 1995 and thereafter than
the combined total they received in 1994 for children birth through two years of age under the Grants for Infants and
Toddlers with Disabilities program and the Chapter 1 Handicapped program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fundamental objective of the Department's reauthorization effort is to improve results for students with disabilities
in America's schools. Reaching this goal requires: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Aligning the IDEA with State and local school reform efforts to ensure a system that enables children with disabilities
to benefit from those efforts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Preparing teachers and administrators to work more effectively with children and youth with disabilities
in all educational settings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promoting the education of children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment and non-categorical
approaches to services to better meet the needs of each child with a disability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Improving the quality of educational services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Focusing resources on teaching and learning; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Improving working relationships between parents and schools.

Issues for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary solicits comments and suggestions regarding the reauthorization of the IDEA. Parts A and B (except
for Section 618) of the IDEA are authorized indefinitely. Statutory authority for Parts C through H expires at the
end of fiscal year 1994. However, Parts C through H will be automatically extended by law through fiscal year 1995.
Comments are especially invited on the following issues that have been identified thus far by parents, teachers,
State and local education administrators, and others concerned with the IDEA reauthorization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;To what extent and under what conditions should children with disabilities be expected to achieve to State
standards and how should children with disabilities be included in State assessment programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any changes to the legal framework for initial evaluations or for triennial reevaluations of children
that could help States and LEAs improve instruction and services for students with disabilities and focus more resources
on teaching and learning? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any changes to the current eligibility requirements, including the use of 13 separate disability
categories, that would promote the education of children with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities in the least restrictive environment and non-categorical approaches that better meet the needs of
each child? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any improvements to statutory provisions concerning Individualized Education Programs that would
increase their effectiveness as tools for educational planning and that would better enable teachers and parents
to help children achieve to high standards? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Without diminishing the rights and protections afforded children with disabilities and their parents, how
can resolving disputes be made less time-consuming, costly, and adversarial? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Should there be any changes to the IDEA to address school safety issues, and if so, what changes would be appropriate?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What changes to the IDEA would help States and LEAs improve the identification of, and services to, children
with disabilities from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What changes to the IDEA would support parents and schools in working closely together to improve educational
results for students with disabilities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any changes to the Part B funding formula that would improve the program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Should schools that are implementing schoolwide projects under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act of 1965 be permitted to use IDEA funds for those projects as long as eligible children under IDEA continue to receive
the rights and protections guaranteed by IDEA? If so, what other conditions, if any, should apply? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any changes to IDEA that should be made to address the needs of students, particularly those in kindergarten
through third grade, who have not been identified as disabled, but who are having learning or emotional difficulties
that may lead to them being identified as disabled at a later age and who may benefit from intervention in the early grades?

Discretionary Grant Programs (Parts C&hyph;G)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current law authorizes a wide range of discretionary programs that support research, demonstrations, outreach,
training, technical assistance, dissemination and other activities. Because these programs have evolved over
time to address needs as they arose, there is considerable variation in authorized activities, terminology, target
populations, eligible applicants, and funding requirements. For example, some programs focus on funding particular
types of activities while other programs focus on specific disability categories or age ranges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is interested in determining how it can improve the discretionary authorities, particularly its
technical assistance and training activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How can the Department improve the coherence and effectiveness of its discretionary programs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How can resources from different programs be consolidated or coordinated to address issues that cut across
age ranges, disabling conditions, and types of activities?

Professional Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Qualified personnel are key to the provision of appropriate educational and early intervention services and to school
reform. States are responsible for developing and implementing comprehensive systems of personnel development
(CSPD) to ensure that the personnel working with children with disabilities have the knowledge and skills necessary
to provide a high quality education. IDEA funding for professional development includes: (1) Part B formula funds
that go to the States and LEAs and may be used for a variety of purposes, of which professional development is only one
of many competing uses; (2) Part D discretionary funds, which, by law, go primarily to institutions of higher education
to support pre-service training of special education teachers; and (3) discretionary funds awarded under other
parts such as Part C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is interested in determining how to improve professional development of all teachers working with
children with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any changes to the current law that would help to ensure that all teachers working with children with
disabilities, including regular education teachers, have the training they need to help children with disabilities
achieve to high standards? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are there any changes that would help States to better design and implement their CSPDs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Part H_Infants and Toddlers With Disabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current formula for the Grants for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Program allocates funds based on the
number of birth-through-two-year-olds in a State's general population. The percentage of infants and toddlers
in the general population served under this program varies widely among States. Some States advocate retaining the
current formula, at least in the near term, while other States have suggested that funds be distributed based on a count
of children actually served rather than population. In addition, some practitioners have suggested that the formula
for allocating funds should take into consideration other factors in addition to population, including the fiscal
capacity of States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is interested in receiving comments on whether the current Part H formula should be retained or changed,
and, if so, how. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Should the number of children in poverty be a factor in allocating funds so that high-poverty areas receive
a greater share of the funds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How can States be encouraged to identify and serve more at-risk infants and toddlers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Should States be given the discretion to provide, as appropriate, a limited (as opposed to the full) array of
services to at-risk children and their families? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What statutory and regulatory barriers exist that impede successful Part H implementation, including identifying
eligible infants and toddlers, providing services, and obtaining financing for services? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What statutory changes are needed to improve coordination of services and resources at the Federal, State,
and local levels? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Should current law, which allows States, at their discretion, to charge sliding fees for early intervention
services, be re-examined?

 The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Chicago Support Office, announces, pursuant to
the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(f) its intent to award a grant to Central Michigan University to analyze
and evaluate the impact of solar domestic hot water heaters (SDHW) on the electric consumption and demand patterns
on Beaver Island, in Lake Michigan, off the City of Charlevoix, Michigan.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
supplementary information:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Central Michigan University (CMU), through its Biological Station at Beaver Island, has been a lead participant
in the Beaver Island Energy Project (BIEP). The BIEP assists the residents of Beaver Island to develop their economy
with energy efficiency and renewable energy to sustain the Island's unique ecological and social infrastructure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One result of the BIEP has been the increased use of solar domestic water heating, supplementing mostly electric domestic
water heating. Beaver Island may have one of the largest percentage concentrations of SDHW for residential structures
in the Great Lakes region. The minimal usage of other seasonal electric demand, such as air conditioning, is an opportunity
to evaluate the effectiveness of SDHW as a demand-side management tool. This award will further the usage of renewable
energy application by monitoring the impact of SDHW on electric power demand and consumption. This study is unique
because it will take place in a northern latitude location in the Great Lakes region to supplement other ongoing studies
of SDHW which are taking place in the southern and western parts of the United States. CMU has supported the BIEP with
the only college-level facilities located on the Island.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unsolicited application is being accepted by DOE as a result of DOE's determination that the proposed activity
is meritorious, likely to be effective and successful, and offers a unique opportunity to further the use of renewable
energy, as encouraged by Titles XII (Renewable Energy) and XVI (Global Climate Change) of the Energy Policy Act of
1992, as well as the Climate Change Action Plan. The project period for the grant award is 24-months, expected to begin
October, 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $30,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objective: Based upon the authority of 10 CFR 600.14, the objective of this grant is for The Lovelace Institute to develop
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NRMI) as a non-invasive technique to measure flow parameters for all components
of multiphase flow. The Institute will also develop a method to measure velocity of the solid phase, in addition to
the liquid phase, in concentrated suspension flow regardless of the sample opacity. Such studies will contribute
to the understanding of solids transport via flows of suspensions. Ultimately, Lovelace institute will measure
the velocity in nonsteady flows. The Institute has pioneered the application of NMRI to flows of concentrated suspensions.
The Lovelace Institute will also apply the proposed concepts to more complex flow geometries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project will provide non-intrusive data which will be relevant and useful in the scale-up and design of solids
handling equipment, thereby providing cost savings. Since solids handling is part of almost all industrial energy
production processes the public will benefit by cost savings from greater efficiencies derived from improved knowledge
of solids handling processes. The project represents a unique and innovative idea which would not be eligible for
financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation, nor would a competitive solicitation be appropriate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 BPA proposes to upgrade its existing operational telecommunications equipment in Northwestern Montana from BPA's
Hot Springs Substation to Garrison Substation, a distance of 190 kilometers (120 miles). This upgrade will involve
replacing existing microwave equipment with fiber optic cable and equipment. The fiber optic cable will be strung
on existing structures on BPA's Hot Springs-Garrison line and will use existing access roads and rights-of-way.
No new structures will be needed for this project. This 190 kilometer line will span both floodplains and wetlands
located in the counties of Sanders, Lake, Missoula, Granite, and Powell, Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR Part 1022), BPA will prepare a floodplain and wetlands assessment and will perform this proposed action in
a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain and wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment will be included in the environmental assessment being prepared for the proposed project in accordance
with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. A floodplain statement of findings will be included
in any finding of no significant impact that may be issued following the completion of the environmental assessment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Within the transmission line corridor, wetlands can be found in association with various river systems and drainages.
Many wetlands found along the Clark Fork river are remnants of old river channels, some of which were isolated during
construction of Interstate 90, while others are due to the natural shifting of the channels (oxbows). Small wetlands
have formed in a few areas adjacent to small drainages, such as Flint Creek. All wetlands are spanned by the fiber optic
cable and avoided by access roads; therefore, there would be no direct impacts to wetlands from the proposed project.
Appropriate mitigation measures will be used to reduce potential indirect impacts to wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transmission line corridor crosses or has structures located in areas identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100-year floodplains. These are areas that have a 1-percent chance of being flooded in a given year. The corridor crosses
floodplains associated with the Clark Fork River, Flint Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, Grant Creek, Butler Creek, Flathead
River, Little Bitterroot River, and Valley Creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are twenty-six structures located in 100-year floodplains. Of these, three (structures 24/8, 25/2, and 91/4)
have been identified as pulling and tensioning sites. Overall impacts to floodplains would be short-term and low;
the proposed project activities would not alter floodplain characteristics or create the potential for greater
loss of property or life during flooding. No new access roads or structures would be needed. At pulling and tensioning
sites disturbance would occur from vehicles and machines, but all three sites are agricultural and would be returned
to their original condition following construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of this statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Take notice that on September 13, 1994, Honeoye Storage Corporation (Honeoye), P.O. Box 376, Honeoye, New York 14471
filed in Docket No. CP80&hyph;277&hyph;005 a petition pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act requesting
authority to amend the certificate issued February 7, 1975, to increase the operating pressure of its existing transmission
pipeline during withdrawal operations, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honeoye requests authority to increase the operating pressure of its transmission line from 774 psia to 900 psia during
withdrawal operations. Honeoye advises that it is not proposing to change the maximum allowable operating pressure
(MAOP) which has been 918 psia since construction. Additionally, Honeoye states that there will be no change in the
service rendered to each of its customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honeoye explains that it receives gas from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (TGPC) at TGPC's main valve No. 236 in Ontario
County, New York and transports the gas for injection into Honeoye's storage field. Honeoye states that during withdrawal
operations, it redelivers gas to TGPC at TGPC's main valve No. 236. Honeoye asserts that because of an increase in TGPC's
line pressure, Honeoye proposes to increase the operating pressure of its transmission line to ensure continuation
of reliable storage service to its customers.

Act requesting authority to construct and operate certain replacement natural gas facilities, all as more fully
set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questar proposes to replace a 26.4-mile segment of its 10-inch Main Line No. 68, located in Rio Blanco and Garfield
Counties, Colorado, with 14-inch pipeline. Questar states that the deteriorated condition of the 26.4-mile segment
requires that it be replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questar asserts that, due to constraints in other portions of its transmission system, there will be no significant
increase in transmission-system capacity as a result of replacing the existing 26.4 miles of 10-inch pipeline with
14-inch pipeline. The estimated cost of the proposed construction is $5,500,000 and the estimated cost to retire
in place the 26.4 miles of 10-inch pipeline is $150,000.

Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Ashland Exploration, Inc. (Ashland), P. O. Box 218330, Houston, Texas 77218&hyph;8330
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;771&hyph;000 a request for a order declaring that the facilities that it proposes to
acquire from CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) are exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ashland states that it has agreed to purchase certain facilities located in the Lincoln, Boone and Kanawha Counties
of West Virginia. These facilities include two compressors, related pipelines, associated structures, and rights-of-way.
Following the Commissions's grant of abandonment and issuance of the proposed declaratory order CNGT will transfer
the facilities to Ashland. Ashland requests that the Commission declare that these facilities are exempt from the
Commission's jurisdiction by reason of the ``production and gathering exemption'' contained in Section 1(b) of
the Natural Gas Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on September 12, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard,
Illinois 60148, and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation (MRT), 9900 Clayton Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63124,
filed, in Docket No. CP94&hyph;773&hyph;000, a joint application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
and Part 157 of the Commission's Regulations for an order permitting and approving the abandonment of the exchange
service performed under Natural's Rate Schedule X&hyph;42 and MRT's Rate Schedule X&hyph;9, all as more fully set
forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural and MRT relate that they entered into a July 17, 1973, gas exchange agreement with Kaskaskia Gas Company (as
of 1988, United Cities Gas Company (Kaskaskia-United Cities)) to assist Kaskaskia in meeting peak day needs in several
isolated areas of its system in southern Illinois. Kaskaskia Gas Company was a local distribution company with facilities
in Illinois and a resale customer of both Natural and MRT. Pursuant to the agreement, Natural, upon notice from Kaskaskia,
reduced its deliveries of sales gas at Cowden, Illinois in amounts up to 500 Mcf of natural gas per day and Natural instead
delivered for the account of Kaskaskia corresponding volumes to MRT in Clinton County, Illinois. MRT, in turn, simultaneously,
delivered equivalent volumes of natural gas to Kaskaskia for the account of Natural at the Salem, Huey, and Iuka, Illinois
delivery points of MRT to Kaskaskia. Natural and MRT state that this exchange service was authorized by order issued
February 27, 1974, in Docket No. CP74&hyph;78&hyph;000, and began on January 11, 1975. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural and MRT report that by letter agreements between Natural, MRT and United Cities dated August 20, 1993 (accepted
by MRT and United Cities on September 7, 1993), and by a letter agreement between MRT and United Cities dated August
2, 1994 (accepted by United Cities on August 5, 1994), that the parties agreed to terminate the exchange service as
of December 1, 1993. Further, Natural and MRT state that there are no facilities to be abandoned pursuant to this application.

Take notice that on September 8, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern), P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama
35202&hyph;2563 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;764&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to abandon certain regulating facilities and to change the
operation of an existing delivery point, under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;406&hyph;000,
all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that it is currently authorized to sell and deliver natural gas to DeKalb-Cherokee Counties Gas District
(DeKalb-Cherokee) at a delivery point located near Milepost 1.724 on Southern's 6-inch Hokes Bluff Line in Etowah
County, Alabama. Southern indicates that it currently delivers gas to DeKalb-Cherokee at the meter station at a contract
delivery pressure of 100 psig. DeKalb-Cherokee has requested, and Southern has agreed to deliver gas at mainline
pressure to DaKalb-Cherokee at the meter station. According to Southern, it must abandon two 3-inch regulators and
appurtenant facilities at the meter station and make certain piping modifications in order to deliver gas at mainline
pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that the abandonment of facilities proposed in this application will not result in any termination
of service, and that said changes will not result in a change in the total firm transportation demand delivered to DeKalb-Cherokee.
Further, Southern states that (1) the revised delivery pressure will not cause a detriment or disadvantage to its
other customers; (2) deliveries at the revised delivery pressure will have no impact on Southern's peak day and annual
deliveries; and (3) the abandonment and change are not prohibited by any existing tariff of Southern.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is granting California a waiver of Federal preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, as amended,
beginning in the 1995 model year to enforce amendments to its motor vehicle pollution control program which establish
the following: New emission standards which are phased in over model years 1995 and 1996 (50% and 100%); and certification
and compliance test procedures and durability requirements. These standards and procedures are applicable to light-duty
trucks (LDTs), medium-duty vehicles and engines (MDVs), and light heavy-duty vehicles and engines (LHDVs) for the
control of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. The standards apply to gasoline, gaseous-fueled, diesel and methanol-fueled
and flexible-fueled vehicles and engines (hereinafter ``MDV'' request). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
California further amended the MDV standards addressed in this waiver during the establishment of California's
Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program. In January of 1993 EPA granted California waiver of Federal preemption for the
LDV component of the LEV Program. Action on the MDV component of the LEV Program was postponed until the earlier MDV
standards which are the subject of today's waiver were acted upon. The MDV component of the LEV Program will be addressed
soon and documents relative to its disposition may be found in Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;71.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 I have decided to grant California a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver of Federal preemption pursuant to section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7543(b),
for amendments to its motor vehicle pollution control program which establish the following: (1) New emission standards
which are phased in over model years 1995 and 1996 (50% and 100%); and (2) certification and compliance test procedures
and durability requirements. These standards and procedures are applicable to light-duty trucks (LDTs), medium-duty
vehicles and engines (MDVs), and light heavy-duty vehicles and engines (LHDVs) for the control of hydrocarbon (HC),

), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. The standards apply to gasoline, gaseous-fueled, diesel and methanol-fueled
vehicles and engines (hereinafter ``MDV'' request). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This decision addresses two related waiver requests. In the first, by letter dated July 15, 1991, the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a request for waiver of Federal
preemption to enforce new medium-duty vehicle standard amendments to its motor vehicle pollution control program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second waiver request addresses dedicated-methanol and flexible-fuel passenger cars, LDTs, MDVs and heavy-duty
engines for model years 1993 and 1994.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 14, 1992, EPA waived application of section 209(a) of the Act for California's amendments to its exhaust
and evaporative emission standards and test procedures that made those standards and procedures applicable to dedicated-methanol
and flexible-fuel passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty engines, for model
years 1993 and 1994 (Methanol waiver).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The methanol regulations addressed in the August 14, 1992 decision had the effect of applying to dedicated methanol
and flexible-fuel vehicles standards previously applicable only to otto- and diesel-cycle vehicles and engines.
Because the underlying new medium-duty vehicle standards for the 1995 and later model years had not been the subject
of a waiver decision, EPA postponed its decision regarding a waiver for such standards as applied to methanol and flexible-fueled
light-duty trucks, medium-duty vehicles and engines and light-heavy-duty vehicles and engines for the 1995 and
later model years until these underlying standards were acted upon.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 I cannot make the findings required for a denial of a waiver under section 209(b)(1) of the Act and applicable case law
with respect to the amendments to California's motor vehicle pollution control program. Therefore, in today's MDV
decision, EPA is granting to the State of California a waiver of application of section 209(a) of the Act for the California
MDV standards as applied to dedicated-methanol and flexible-fuel otto-cycle and diesel-cycle medium-duty vehicles
and engines for model year 1995 and following.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 209(b) of the Act provides that, if certain criteria are met, the Administrator shall waive Federal preemption
for California to enforce new motor vehicle emission standards and accompanying enforcement procedures. The criteria
include consideration of whether California arbitrarily and capriciously determined that its standards are, in
the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the applicable Federal standards; whether California
needs State standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; and whether California's amendments are
consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB determined that these standards and accompanying enforcement procedures do not cause California's standards,
in the aggregate, to be less protective of public health and welfare than the applicable Federal standards. Information
presented to me by parties opposing California's waiver request did not demonstrate that California arbitrarily
or capriciously reached this protectiveness determination. Therefore, I cannot find California's determination
to be arbitrary or capricious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB has continually demonstrated the existence of compelling and extraordinary conditions justifying the need
for its own motor vehicle pollution control program, which includes the subject standards and procedures. No information
has been submitted to demonstrate that California no longer has a compelling and extraordinary need for its own program.
Therefore, I agree that California continues to have compelling and extraordinary conditions which require its
own program, and, thus, I cannot deny the waiver on the basis of the lack of compelling and extraordinary conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CARB has submitted information that the requirements of its emission standards and test procedures are technologically
feasible and present no inconsistency with Federal requirements and are, therefore, consistent with section 202(a)
of the Act. Information presented to me by parties opposing California's waiver request did not satisfy the burden
of persuading EPA that the standards are not technologically feasible within the available lead time, considering
costs. Thus, I cannot find that California's amendments will be inconsistent with section 202(a) of the Act. Accordingly,
I hereby grant the waiver requested by California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
My decision will affect not only persons in California but also the manufacturers outside the State who must comply
with California's requirements in order to produce motor vehicles for sale in California. For this reason, I hereby
determine and find that this is a final action of national applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may be sought only in the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Petitions for review must be filed by November 21, 1994. Under section
307(b)(2) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may not be obtained in subsequent enforcement proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with past waiver decisions, this action is not a rule as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, it is exempt
from review by the Office of Management and Budget as required for rules and regulations by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this action is not a rule as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Therefore, EPA
has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this action on small business
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Administrator has delegated the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make determinations regarding waivers of Federal preemption under section 209(b) of the Act to the Assistant Administrator
for Air and Radiation.

The organizations listed in this notice have applied under  225.23(a)(2) or (f) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR
225.23(a)(2) or (f)) for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8))
and  225.21(a) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged
in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely related to banking and permissible for
bank holding companies. Unless otherwise noted, such activities will be conducted throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise noted, comments regarding each of these applications must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated
for the application or the offices of the Board of Governors not later than October 17, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is requesting nominations for members to serve on the board to the National Center for Toxicological Research
(NCTR). The function of the board is to advise the Director, NCTR, on establishment and implementation of a research
program that will assist in fulfilling the regulatory responsibilities of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The
board provides an extra-agency review to ensure that the research programs at NCTR are scientifically sound and pertinent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons nominated for membership shall have adequately diversified experience that is appropriate to the work of
the board in the fields related to toxicological research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specialized training and experience necessary&sect; to qualify nominees as experts suitable forappointment

General Public Representatives (Consumer-nominated Members) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA currently attempts to place on committees members who are nominated by consumer organizations. These members
are recommended by a consortium of 12 consumer organizations that has the responsibility for screening, interviewing,
and recommending consumer-nominated candidates with appropriate scientific credentials. Candidates are sought
who are aware of the consumer impact of committee issues, but who also possess enough technical background to understand
and contribute to the committee's work. For some advisory committees the agency notes, however, it may require such
nominees to meet the same technical qualifications and specialized training required of other expert members of
the committee. The term of office for these members is up to 4 years, depending on the appointment date. Nominations
are invited for consideration for membership as openings become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Nomination Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any interested person may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the board. Nominations shall state
that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is willing to serve as a member of the board, and appears to have no conflict
of interest that would preclude board membership. Potential candidates will be asked by FDA to provide detailed information
concerning such matters as financial holdings, consultancies, and research grants or contracts in order to permit
evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Function
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The function of the board is to provide advice primarily to the agency's Senior Science Advisor and, as needed, to the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs and other appropriate officials on specific complex and technical issues as well as
emerging issues within the scientific community in academia and industry. Additionally, the board provides advice
to the agency on keeping pace with technical and scientific evolutions in the field of regulatory science, on formulating
an appropriate research agenda, and on upgrading its scientific and research facilities to keep pace with these changes.
The board also provides the means for critical review of agency sponsored intramural and extramural scientific research
programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Criteria for Members
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons nominated for membership from academia, industry, and government representatives shall be knowledgeable
in the fields of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, clinical research, and other scientific disciplines. The
term of office is up to 4 years, depending on the appointment date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Public Representatives (Consumer-nominated Members)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA currently attempts to place members on advisory committees who are nominated by consumer organizations. These
members are recommended by a consortium of 12 consumer organizations that has the responsibility for screening,
interviewing, and recommending consumer-nominated candidates with appropriate scientific credentials. Candidates
are sought who are aware of the consumer impact of committee issues, but who also possess enough technical background
to understand and contribute to the committee's work. The agency notes, however, that for some advisory committees,
it may require such nominees to meet the same technical qualifications and specialized training required of other
expert members of the committee. The term of office for these members is up to 4 years, depending on the appointment
date. Nominations are invited for consideration for membership as openings become available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Nomination Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any interested person may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the board. Nominations shall state
that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is willing to serve as a member of the board, and appears to have no conflict
of interest that would preclude board membership. Potential candidates will be asked by FDA to provide detailed information
concerning such matters as financial holdings, consultancies, and research grants or contracts in order to permit
evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The road segment in South Park Canyon closed through this order is located on a steep canyon wall over 100 feet above
the canyon bottom. Rockslides have removed a section of the roadbed and rendered the road impassible to motorized
vehicles. In March 1994 a makeshift bridge was constructed across this chasm without BLM notification or authorization.
The road segment and bridge will remain closed until the structure can be inspected and repaired to ensure it meets
the standards prescribed by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the
American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM). If the bridge cannot be modified to meet these standards, it will be
removed.

The purpose of this closure order in South Park Canyon is to protect persons and property on an impassable mountain
road in a remote desert area. South Park Canyon can still be adequately accessed via P 142 from the west and from the east
by a road network accessed from P 82 in Pleasant Canyon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maps showing the affected area are available by contacting the Ridgecrest Resource Area Office. Signs will be installed
at the closure points and the affected area will be posted with public notices and standard motorized vehicle closure
signs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Authority for this closure is granted in 43 CFR 8364.1 (a). Violation of this order is punishable by a fine, not to exceed
$100,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to retain two existing withdrawals for 20 years for 37.50 acres of public land
lying outside National Forest Boundaries in Bonneville County to protect the Grays Lake Refuge Headquarters. The
land is presently closed to surface entry and mining by two withdrawals which are no longer needed by the Forest Service.
The withdrawals would be retained and jurisdiction of the lands transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service under
the proposal.

The purpose of the withdrawals is to protect recreation areas, roadside zones, and administrative sites. The withdrawals
segregate the land from location and entry under the mining laws, but not the mineral leasing laws, and in some instances,
also segregates the land from settlement, sale, location, and entry. No change is proposed in the purpose or segregative
effect of the withdrawals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments in connection
with the proposed withdrawal continuations may present their views in writing to the Chief, Branch of Lands and Minerals
Operations, in the Utah State Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management will undertake such investigations as are necessary to determine
the existing and potential demand for the land and its resources. A report will be prepared for consideration by the
Secretary of the Interior, the President, and Congress, who will determine whether or not the withdrawals will be
continued, and, if so, for how long. The final determination on the continuation of the withdrawals will be published
in the

The MMS prepare EA's and FONSI's for proposals which relate to exploration for and the development/production of
oil and gas resources on the Gulf of Mexico OCS. The EA's examine the potential environmental effects of activities
described in the proposals and present MMS conclusions regarding the significance of those effects. Environmental
Assessments are used as a basis for determining whether or not approval of the proposals constitutes major Federal
actions that significantly affects the quality of the human environment in the sense of NEPA Section 102(2)(C). A
FONSI is prepared in those instances where the MMS finds that approval will not result in significant effects on the
quality of the human environment. The FONSI briefly presents the basis for that finding and includes a summary or copy
of the EA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission instituted this formal enforcement proceeding on January 10, 1994. 59 FR 3123&hyph;27 (Jan. 20, 1994).
The enforcement proceeding complaint was filed by the Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations (OUII),
and alleges violations of the Commission cease and desist order and modified cease and desist order issued in the underlying
investigation against respondent Analog Devices, Inc. (Analog). The complaint seeks appropriate sanctions for
these alleged violations. The parties to the enforcement proceeding are OUII, represented by its investigative
attorneys (IAs); enforcement proceeding respondent Analog; and Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI), the complainant
in the underlying investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its response to the complaint, Analog denied that it violated the terms of the Commission's cease and desist orders.
In addition, Analog alleged several affirmative defenses, including: waiver against the Commission, equitable
estoppel against the Commission, and Commission action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and
contrary to law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 28, 1994, Analog filed a motion for summary determination seeking termination of the enforcement proceeding
on the grounds that there are no genuine issues of disputed facts. The IAs and TI filed responses in opposition to Analog's
motion for summary determination. The IAs also filed a cross-motion for partial summary determination with respect
to Analog's affirmative defenses. TI supported, and Analog opposed, the IAs' cross-motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 22, 1994 the ALJ issued an order (Order No. 7) denying Analog's motion for summary determination, and an ID
granting the IAs' cross-motion for partial summary determination regarding Analog's affirmative defenses. Analog
petitioned for review of the ID granting the IAs' cross-motion, and the IAs and TI filed responses in opposition to
Analog's petition. Analog also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested oral argument on its petition. The Commission denied that request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. &sect;1337, and &sect;210.53

 The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of preliminary antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;720
and 721 (Preliminary) under section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)) to determine whether there
is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material
injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from
China and Taiwan of wheel inserts,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 provided for in subheading 8708.70.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to
be sold in the United States at less than fair value. The Commission must complete preliminary antidumping investigations
in 45 days, or in this case by October 31, 1994.

Also known as lug hole inserts or insert bushings, wheel inserts are steel, aluminum, brass, or zinc devices, usually
circular in form with a round hole through the center, that are inserted through the stud holes of aluminum and alloy
wheels used on automobiles, trucks, vans, buses, or trailers. The term ``wheel inserts'' does not include washers
or wheel spacers, which are not inserted through a studhole. The subject wheel inserts may or may not have a surface
coating and may or may not be heat-treated. The surface coating could include chrome plating, nickel plating, zinc
plating (with or without wax coating), oxide coating, and powder coating. Wheel inserts are produced in a variety
of sizes depending on the type of wheel and the size of the stud hole into which they are inserted; the shape of the insert
interface may be spherical (called a ball seat) or conical to fit the lug nut or wheel lock which is attached to the stud.

Mr. Cundiff indicates that: (1) the rail lines operated by RVSC and the other class III rail carriers do not connect
with each other; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect
the railroads with each other or any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve
a class I carrier. The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343.

of hazardous waste at its facility in Ludington, Michigan, without a permit or interim status under the Act, and defendant's
failure to satisfy the financial responsibility requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations. The decree
requires defendant to pay a civil penalty of $350,000 to the United States. The injunctive relief originally sought
by the filing of this action was satisfied when the Environmental Protection Agency, in January 1994, approved the
defendant's certification of the closure of the surface impoundments that were the subject of the Complaint.

and operator of a petroleum refinery in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. The United States has alleged that SUN violated
the Act by discharging pollutants from its Marcus Hook facility into the Delaware County Regional Water Control Authority
(``DELCORA''), a publicly-owned treatment works (``POTW'') located in Chester, Pennsylvania in violation of the
pretreatment requirements applicable to such discharges under Section 307 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 1317, and further

Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 16(b)&hyph;(h)) (``APPA''), the
United States of America hereby files the public comments it has received relating to the proposed Final Judgment

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
This action was commenced on June 15, 1994, when the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section
15 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 25, alleging that the proposed acquisition of a 20% equity interest in MCI
Communications Corporation (``MCI'') by British Telecommunications plc (``BT''), and the proposed formation
of a joint venture between MCI and BT to provide international enhanced telecommunications services, would violate
Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, by lessening competition in the markets for global seamless
telecommunications services and for international telecommunications services between the United States and
the United Kingdom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the same date, the United States submitted a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement, and a Stipulation
signed by the defendants consenting to entry of the proposed Final Judgment. The proposed Final Judgment contains
terms and conditions safeguarding against discriminatory and other anticompetitive practices that would favor
the defendants over competing United States providers of international telecommunications services and harm competition.
The Competitive Impact Statement explains the basis for the Complaint and the reasons why entry of the proposed Final
Judgment would be in the public interest. In the Stipulation, defendants and the United States consent to entry of
the proposed Final Judgment by the Court after completion of the procedures required by the APPA.

The APPA requires a sixty-day period for the submission of public comments on the proposed Final Judgment, 15 U.S.C.
16(b). In this case, the sixty-day comment period commenced on June 27, 1994, and terminated on August 26, 1994. During
this period, the United States received comments by one competitor of MCI and BT relating to the proposed Final Judgment.

Response to Public Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
The only comments received by the United States were filed by ACC Global Corporation (``ACC''), one of the companies
recognized by the United States and the defendants in the Stipulation as a competitor entitled to receive information
concerning the defendants, under the provisions of the proposed Final Judgment. ACC is a resale provider of international
telecommunications services in the United States, and one of its subsidiaries has received a license to provide international
simple resale services in the United Kingdom. ACC does not oppose prompt resolution of this matter through a consent
decree, and indeed it considers the transparency requirements in Section II.A of the proposed Final Judgment as ``of
vital importance in ameliorating the potential anticompetitive impact of the agreements that gave rise to the complaint
filed by the DOJ in this matter.'' ACC Comments at 2. These transparency requirements, ACC states, provide ``substantial
protection to Competitors such as ACC'' because they ensure the availability of evidence that can be used in enforcement
proceedings under the decree, or in proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission and British regulatory
authorities.

 at 3. ACC's concerns pertain solely to two limited aspects of the transparency provisions, which it recommends be
clarified or modified. After consideration of ACC's comments, the United States is of the view that neither of the
modifications recommended by ACC are necessary to achieve the competitive purposes of the proposed Final Judgment.

A. Provision of Information Directly to Competitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
First, ACC contends that the information to be disclosed by defendants under Section II.A should be provided by defendants
simultaneously both to competitors and to the Department of Justice, rather than being submitted first to the Department
and then being furnished by the Department to qualified competitors, as the proposed Final Judgment now specifies.
Although ACC recognizes that it is qualified to receive the information from the Department, and does not suggest
that it would be refused access, it believes that for the defendants to provide the information directly to the competitors
would involve only a ``slight incremental burden,'' would facilitate monitoring by competitors, and would relieve
the Department of the ``burden of handling the distribution function.'' ACC Comments at 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedure for providing information from defendants to their competitor through the Department, as described
in Section IV.E of the proposed Final Judgment and the Stipulation, was developed in response to the concerns of defendants
that they not be required to disclose to the public at large, or to competitors for use in the marketing and sales of their
services, information that may be competitively sensitive. The provision of this information to competitors, as
ACC appreciates, is intended to aid in detecting discriminatory or other anticompetitive conduct and making appropriate
complaints to government authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the United States, in the circumstances of this case, accepted that some protection against general public
disclosure of the defendants' information should be provided, it opposed allowing the defendants to have any role
in screening their competitors and determining which ones would have accress to the information, or being able to
influence the timing of such access. The United States was reasonably concerned that the defendants would have incentives
to frustrate and delay access to their information by competitors, and might impose unreasonable confidentiality
restrictions that would discourage competitors from availing themselves of access to the information, were they
assigned the responsibility of disseminating the information to competitors directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACC's proposal, if adopted, could have the unintended consequence of impairing rather than facilitating monitoring
of defendants by their competitors, and could impose the additional burden on the Department of refereeing disputes
over access procedures between defendants and firms such as ACC. There is no reason for ACC to be concerned that the
Department will postpone dissemination of the information that it receives from defendants. Rather, qualified
competitors such as ACC that enter into a simple form confidentiality agreement with the Department and abide by the
agreement will be sent promptly copies of any information furnished by defendants pursuant to Section II.A of the
Final Judgment, following the Department's receipt of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Waiver of Transparency Requirements by the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, ACC objects to the provision in Section II.A that would allow the United States to waive compliance with the
transparency requirements, in whole or in part, through written notice to defendants and the Court. ACC believes
that giving the United States discretion to waive the transparency requirements without prior public notice and
comment and approval by the Court would ``defeat the purpose of the Tunney Act,'' ACC Comments at 4, and could lead to
the United States vitiating the decree, whether intentionally or unwittingly due to lack of the knowledge of the industry
possessed by defendant's competitors.

The transparency requirements are the most detailed and complex substantive provisions of the proposed Final Judgment,
and therefore the most likely to be affected by regulatory changes in the United States and the United Kingdom as well
as marketplace developments. They have been designed to be consistent with existing regulatory requirements in
both countries, and they do not conflict in any way with the additional obligations recently imposed by the Federal
Communications Commission as a precondition to its approval of the transactions between BT and MCI, following the
filing of the proposed Final Judgment with the Court.

It remains possible, however, that future actions by telecommunications regulatory authorities in the United States
or the United Kingdom could give rise to conflicts with the Final Judgment, or that some of the transparency provisions
could become unnecessary as the result of regulatory decisions or significant changes in the competitive environment
in the United Kingdom affecting international telecommunications. Accordingly, the proposed Final Judgment was
drafted to provide some flexibility for limited adjustments without unduly burdening the Court. The United States
agreed to include in the proposed Final Judgment language giving it authority, upon express written notice to defendants
and to the Court, to waive the transparency requirements in whole or in part without a prior public comment process
or formal approval by the Court. This will enable the United States to respond rapidly to changing conditions that
affect the enforcement and usefulness of these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States would not, of course, be obliged to waive any of the transparency requirements merely because a regulatory
agency adopted similar obligations for defendants, or took action giving rise to a conflict with the defendants'
decree obligations. Nor would a decline in BT's market shares or other changes in its competitive position necessarily
warrant modification.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The United States would, however, be able to modify the transparency requirements where desirable to further the
public interest, without the need for lengthy comment filing periods or delays engendered from crowded court dockets.
Often it will be useful, as ACC suggests, for the United States to obtain information from competitors as well as defendants
before agreeing to modify any of the transparency requirements. There is nothing in the proposed Final Judgment that
precludes the United States from soliciting the views of affected competitors on a case-by-case basis before reaching
a decision, and indeed the United States expects that it would frequently do so.

Information disclosed in BT's most recent public report for 1994, which the United States obtained after the filing
of the Complaint and proposed Final Judgment, indicates that BT's current market shares are no more than one to three
percentage points below those stated in the Complaint and the Competitive Impact Statement. This report also acknowledges
that there are signs that the rate of attrition of BT's market share for business customers is declining.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
ACC is incorrect in suggesting that this authority for the United States to waive the transparency requirements is
somehow improper under the Tunney Act. The APPA requires that any proposal for a consent judgment submitted by the
United States in a civil antitrust proceeding be filed with the district court, and directs that the consent judgment
only be entered after the district court has found that it is in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. 16(b), (e). It nowhere
precludes the district court, however, from concluding that it would be in the public interest to permit the United
States to waive compliance with certain specified provisions of a consent judgment after its entry, so as to respond
to regulatory or marketplace changes. ACC cites no authority to the contrary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Were the United States and the defendants to agree to a modification of this consent judgment after its entry, this
Court would in any event be ``bound to accept any modification that the Department *&blank;*&blank;* reasonably
regarded as advancing the public interest.''

114 S. Ct. 487 (1993). Section VII of the proposed Final Judgment, with which ACC does not quarrel, specifies that ``[i]f
a motion to modify this Final Judgment is not contested by any party, it shall be granted if the proposed modification
is within the reaches of the public interest.'' The discretionary waiver authority in Section II.A of the proposed
Final Judgment simply averts the risk of prolonged litigation over every change to the transparency requirements,
litigation that would in the great majority if not all cases result in no public benefit, but would simply confirm that
the modification agreed to by the United States and the defendants was within the reaches of the public interest.

After careful consideration of the comments, the United States continues to believe that, for the reason stated herein
and in the Competitive Impact Statement, the proposed Final Judgment is adequate to remedy the antitrust violations
alleged in the Complaint. There has been no showing that the proposed settlement constitutes an abuse of the United
States' discretion or that it is not within the zone of settlements consistent with the public interest. Therefore,
entry of the proposed Final Judgment should be found to be in the pubic interest.

Dear Mr. Rosen: On behalf of ACC Global Corp. (``ACC''), we respectfully submit these comments on the Proposed Final
Judgment in the above captioned case. ACC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACC Corp., headquartered in Rochester, New
York, is an international resale interexchange carrier that is an applicant for authority to provide international
private line resale service between the United States and the United Kingdom. Another ACC Corp. subsidiary, ACC Long
Distance UK Limited, received the first U.K. license to provide international simple resale service. ACC is one of
only seven entities which the parties have stipulated are ``qualified United States international telecommunications
providers'' (``Competitors''), as defined in Section II.E. of the proposed Final Judgment. As such, ACC competes
with BT Forty-Eight Co. and its parent firms, MCI Communications Corp. (``MCI'') and British Telecommunications
plc (``BT'') (collectively ``Defendants'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACC does not oppose prompt resolution of this matter through entry of a consent decree. ACC strongly recommends, however,
that ``the transparency'' requirements of the proposed Final Judgment be clarified and modified so as to ensure that
they achieve the intended effect of minimizing the potential anticompetitive effects of the Defendants' concerted
activities. Specifically, ACC's comments address two respects in which ACC believes that the ``transparency''
provisions of the proposed Final Judgment are deficient or unclear. First, ACC believes that the proposed decree
should be clarified to ensure that the Competitors as well as the Department of Justice (``DOJ'') receive copies of
the information required to be furnished under the transparency requirements. Second, ACC is seriously concerned
about the adverse impact of the provision permitting the DOJ to waive the transparency requirements of the decree
without notice or comment by the beneficiaries of those requirements and without Court approval.

The proposed Final Judgment provides ACC and others subject to this discrimination with important protection against
such discrimination in the Section II.A. transparency requirements. Under Section II.A., NewCo and MCI would be
required to ``disclose'' a broad array of information regarding their dealings with BT. Under Section IV.E., such
``disclosure'' would be made to the DOJ which may, in turn, disclose such information to any U.S. corporation that
holds or has applied for a license to provide international telecommunication services between the U.S. and the U.K.
(This would include ACC.)

As the DOJ recognizes in its Competitive Impact Statement, the benefit of this requirement is that it:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

Will enable the principal competitors of MCI and NewCo to monitor whether either of these companies is receiving discriminatory
treatment in their favor from BT, and provide them with evidence that could be used to make a complaint to any governmental
authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom.

This provision provides substantial protection to Competitors such as ACC because it ensures the availability of
evidence relevant to enforcement proceedings under the consent decree. Moreover, such evidence would be significant
in complaint and licensing proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission, which has enforcement and
oversight authority over the U.S. common carrier Defendants. Similarly, such evidence would be relevant to oversight
proceedings in the U.K. before Oftel and other supervisory agencies.

II. Necessary Clarification and Modifications of the Transparency Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
Competitors should not have to rely on the DOJ to provide them, in timely fashion, with copies of information required
to be furnished under the transparency provisions. Rather, the information should be provided promptly and simultaneously
to both the DOJ and Competitors. Without such information, Competitors cannot provide a monitoring function contemplated
by the Competitive Impact Statement as a check on potential anticompetitive activity. Particularly in light of the
unusually short term of the proposed decree, any slight incremental burden on the Defendants by providing additional
copies of the required information to the small number of identified Competitors is more than justified by the greater
protection of the public afforded by facilitating Competitors' monitoring activities, and by relieving the Plaintiff
DOJ from the burden of handling the distribution function. (The DOJ could, however, be required to modify the class
of Competitors entitled to receive the information from time to time as additional potential class members request
inclusion in it, and to notify the Defendants accordingly.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, ACC is also concerned that Section II.A. of the Proposal Final Judgment permits, without either public
notice or comment or Court approval, the waiver of ``such disclosure *&blank;*&blank;* by plaintiff through written
notice to defendants and the Court.'' The only explanation offered by the DOJ for this waiver provision is that the
``transparency requirements may be affected by changes in regulation or other circumstances.

In ACC's view, providing the DOJ unfettered discretion to waive this critical provision of the decree without Court
approval or public notice or comment would defeat the purpose of the Tunney Act. As Judge Harold Greene recognized
in United States v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
552 F. Supp. 131, 148 (D.D.C. (1982),

aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
460 U.S. 1001 (1983), Congress enacted the Tunney Act because ``prior practice, which gave the Department almost
total control of the consent decree process,'' failed to ``fully promote the goals of the antitrust laws and foster
public confidence in their fair enforcement.'' Judge Greene went on to observe that:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history shows that Congress was particularly concerned that the ``excessive secrecy'' of the consent
decree process deprived the public of the opportunity to scrutinize and comment upon proposed decrees, thereby undermining
confidence in the legal system. In addition, the legislators found that consent decrees often failed to provide appropriate
relief, either because of miscalculations by the Justice Department or because of the ``great influence and economic
power'' wielded by antitrust violators. The history, indeed, contains references to a number of antitrust settlements
deemed ``blatantly inequitable and improper'' on these bases.

Regardless of the ability and negotiating skill of the Government's attorneys, they are neither omniscient nor infallible.
The increasing expertise of so-called public interest advocates and for that matter the more immediate concern of
a defendant's competitors, employees, or antitrust victims may well serve to provide additional data, analysis,
or alternatives which would improve the outcome.

The blanket waiver authority conferred on the DOJ by the proposed Final Judgment, however, is not limited by any standards
or guidelines and is totally at odds with this reasoning. Through its unfettered discretion to waive a critical requirement
of the decree, absent judicial approval or the comment of the public or Defendants' competitors, the DOJ could, either
unwittingly or intentionally, vitiate the decree. No adequate explanation has been offered why, if modification
of the decree becomes necessary because of changed circumstances, the modification could not be submitted for public
comment and Court approval in accordance with the Tunney Act, as is usually done.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such a requirement could avert the clearly undesirable possibility of the DOJ's inadvertently, because of its lack
of the intimate knowledge of the industry possessed by Defendants' competitors, authorizing the Defendants to engage
in anticompetitive conduct. Thus, at a minimum, the DOJ should be required, prior to waiving any Section II.A. requiring,
to provide notice and an opportunity to comment to the Competitors to whom information is to be provided pursuant to
Section IV.E.

In sum, ACC believes that the transparency provisions are critical to the efficacy of the proposed decree. In order
to ensure their implementation in an effective manner, however, they should be clarified or modified to ensure automatic
and timely disclosure also to Competitors of the information required to be furnished to the DOJ, and to ensure that
they cannot be waived unilaterally by the DOJ without judicial approval following notice to and an opportunity for
comment by the Competitors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 2, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Irving R. Majors, Sr., M.D., at 7710 East King Highway 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
56, Shreveport, Louisiana; c/o Medical Park Hospital, 2001 South Main, Hope, Arkansas; and 1905 NW Loop 281, c/o Centra
Med, Longview, Texas. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Majors' DEA Certificates of Registration, BM2917586,
AM3141948, and AM3180635, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registrations as a practitioner
under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The statutory predicate for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause was Dr. Majors' lack of authorization
to handle controlled substances in the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). In addition,
the Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Majors' continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest,
as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was sent to each of Dr. Majors' registered locations by registered mail and were returned to
DEA unclaimed. The Order to Show Cause was personally served on Dr. Majors on March 14, 1994. More than thirty days have
passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Dr. Majors, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has received
no response thereto. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Majors has waived his opportunity for
a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d) and 1301.54(e), enters this
final order based on the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that in January 1992, the Metro Narcotics Unit, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana received
information from a pharmacist regarding a suspicious telephone prescription. The Metro Narcotics Unit subsequently
initiated an undercover investigation. The investigation revealed that from January 10 to 20, 1992, Dr. Majors telephoned
several pharmacies and authorized the dispensation of controlled substances to an undercover operative for no legitimate
medical purpose. Dr. Majors charged the undercover operative one dollar per tablet. Arrangements for the sale of
the controlled substances took place in Dr. Majors' car under the direct surveillance of the Metro Narcotics Unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 20, 1992, Dr. Majors was arrested for illegal distribution of controlled substances. On July 6, 1993, Dr.
Majors was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance (hydrocodone), six counts of
distribution of a controlled substance (hydrocodone), and eight counts of attempted distribution of a controlled
substance (hydrocodone).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the aforementioned activities, Dr. Majors' authority to handle controlled substances was terminated
in three states. On March 26, 1992, the Arkansas State Medical Board issued an emergency order of suspension of Dr.
Majors' medical license finding that he distributed and conspired to distribute a controlled substance. On April
28, 1993, the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners by Final Decision suspended Dr. Majors' license to practice
medicine for three years and ordered that he be barred from prescribing, dispensing, or administering any controlled
substances for the duration of his medical career. On January 14, 1994, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners
by Final Order revoked Dr. Majors' license to practice medicine. The Board concluded that Dr. Majors' continued practice
of medicine was an imminent peril to the public health, safety, and welfare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator concludes that, based upon the information contained in the investigative file, there
are sufficient grounds for the revocation of Dr. Majors' DEA Certificates of Registration and for the denial of any
pending applications for renewal. The fact that Dr. Majors is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances
in the States of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas is a sufficient ground, by itself, to order the revocation of his registrations.
DEA has consistently held that it cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not authorized to handle
controlled substances in the state in which he practices. 21 U.S.C. 823(f);

in the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, the Deputy Administrator cannot maintain his DEA Certificates of
Registration in those states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the information regarding Dr. Majors' improper handling of controlled substances provides additional
support for the revocation of his registrations and for the denial of any pending applications for renewal. The investigative
file elucidates Dr. Majors absolute disregard for Federal and state controlled substance laws and regulations.
The undercover investigation conducted by the Metro Narcotics Unit clearly and most convincingly showed that Dr.
Majors abandoned his professional responsibility as a physician. He knowingly became a source of drugs to be used
for non-medical purposes. Dr. Majors' continued registration would pose a serious threat to the public health and
safety and would be wholly inconsistent with the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificates of Registration
AM3141948, BM2917586 and AM3180635 previously issued to Irving R. Majors, Sr., M.D., be, and they hereby are, revoked.
The Deputy Administrator further orders that all pending applications for the renewal of such registrations, be,
and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 24, 1994.

I. Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Region III,
enter into this Agreement under the authority of Section 1701 (c)(4)B of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended
and the Joint Statement of Understanding between the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy
on Implementing Energy Policy Act Provisions on Regulation of Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Plants (Joint
Statement), 59 FR 4729 (February 1, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. &sect;2297 et seq.), created the
United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), a government corporation for the purpose of managing and operating
the uranium enrichment enterprise previously owned and operated by the DOE. The Energy Policy Act (the Act) also required
that by October 24, 1994, the NRC establish its standards for the regulation of the gaseous diffusion plants leased
by the USEC in order to protect the public health and safety and to provide for the common defense and security. After
these standards are promulgated, the USEC is required to apply at least annually for a certificate of compliance with
the standards. Until such time as the NRC assumes regulatory jurisdiction at the gaseous diffusion plants (GDPs),
DOE will exercise nuclear safety and safeguards and security oversight authority at the leased portion of the gaseous
diffusion plants located in Paducah, Kentucky, and Piketon, Ohio. The regulatory framework of DOE's authority is
contained in the Regulatory Oversight Agreement, Exhibit D to the Lease Agreement between DOE and USEC dated July
1, 1993. Pursuant to the Joint Statement, it is agreed that the NRC will locate observers at the facilities on or after
July 1, 1993, to obtain information and knowledge that may be useful to NRC in developing or implementing its standards.
The Joint Statement also provides that interim guidance for the NRC inspectors/observers will be established between
the DOE Regulatory Oversight Manager and the NRC covering the period before the NRC assumes regulatory jurisdiction
over the facilities.

III. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. This agreement defines the way in which DOE and NRC will cooperate to facilitate the NRC's obtaining of information
and knowledge regarding the gaseous diffusion plants and USEC's operation thereof through routine and special inspection
activities during the interim period before NRC assumes regulatory responsibility. The NRC inspection activities
will be conducted for the purpose of gathering information useful to the NRC in developing the 10 CFR Part 76 standards
and making the initial certification decision for the GDPs as directed in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
This Agreement does not apply to investigations or inquiries conducted by DOE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term ``inspection'' as applied to DOE shall mean the examination, review,
or evaluation of any program or activity of the USEC with respect to: (1) the effectiveness of the program or activity
in ensuring that the health and safety of the public and plant personnel are adequately protected; (2) the safe operation
of the facilities; (3) compliance with any applicable DOE Nuclear Safety and Safeguards and Security Requirements
as defined in the Regulatory Oversight Agreement (ROA). With respect to the NRC, the term ``inspection'' is defined
as the onsite or Regional/Headquarters Office review of any program or activity of USEC with respect to prospective
compliance with proposed NRC standards for the regulation of the leased portions of the gaseous diffusion plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict or expand the authority of DOE or to affect or otherwise alter the
terms of the ROA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the NRC Inspectors authority to (1) interpret or modify DOE requirements
imposed on the USEC; (2) take enforcement actions; or (3) direct or recommend gaseous diffusion plant employees to
take or not to take any actions. Authority for all such actions is reserved exclusively to DOE, until the NRC assumes
regulatory oversight for the leased portion of the gaseous diffusion plants in accordance with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Nothing in this agreement is intended to restrict or otherwise limit the authority of the NRC to exercise its full
regulatory authority, including both inspection and enforcement authority, at such time as NRC assumes regulatory
authority over the leased portion of the gaseous diffusion plants in accordance with Title II of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Under this Agreement, up to three NRC Resident Inspectors may be located at each gaseous diffusion plant site with
visits from Regional and Headquarters staff to become familiar with plant operations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 28, 1991 the NRC issued Generic Letter 88&hyph;20, Supplement 4, Individual Plant Examination of External
Events (IPEEE) for Severe Accident Vulnerabilities, and NUREG&hyph;1407, Procedural and Submittal Guidance for
IPEEE. The Generic Letter requested all licensees to perform an IPEEE to identify plant-specific vulnerabilities
to severe accidents due to external events and report the results to the NRC. NUREG&hyph;1407 provides guidance for
conducting the IPEEE. Key elements of the development of the IPEEE guidance included assigning earthquake review
level and review scope for the seismic events. In this development, for central and eastern U.S. plants, the process
of assigning plants to appropriate review categories has relied largely on the use of available seismic hazard results:
those developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1989 and Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI) in 1989. However, grouping of the plants relied heavily on a grouping technique with a number of attributes
using seismic hazard on a relative basis. In 1993, based on a re-elicitation of LLNL ground-motion and seismicity
experts, revised seismic hazard results were issued in NUREG&hyph;1488. The revised mean hazard results are significantly
lower than the 1989 LLNL results, and are much closer to the 1989 EPRI hazard results. These results prompted the NRC
to revisit the seismic IPEEE program and consider the potential impact of the revised LLNL results. The Draft Report
will be discussed during the workshop. A detailed agenda will be available on October 14, 1994 at the PDR.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Company, et al.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment To Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Illinois Power Company (the licensee)
to withdraw its February 17, 1993, application for a proposed amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;62
for the Clinton Power Station (CPS), Unit No. 1, located in DeWitt County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment consisted of three proposed partial exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J regarding containment integrated leakage rate testing, three proposed changes to associated CPS Technical Specification
3/4.6.1.2, ``Primary Containment Leakage,'' and changes to the CPS Technical Specification Bases and Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;62.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the three requested exemptions was granted. A partial exemption from the 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a)
requirement to perform the third Type A test of each 10-year service period when the plant is shut down for the 10-year
plant inservice inspection was granted in Amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
83 dated September 8, 1993. However, requests for partial exemptions from the requirements of Section III.A.1.(a)
(the requirement to stop a containment integrated leak rate test if excessive leakage is detected) and Section III.A.5.(b)
(acceptance criteria for containment integrated leak rate tests with respect to determining the frequency of conducting
future tests) was deferred pending resolution of ongoing rulemaking activities associated with Appendix J.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SECY&hyph;94&hyph;036 dated February 17, 1994, described the staff's plans for completion of rulemaking on Appendix
J and how plant-specific requests for contingency and performance based exemptions would compete for limited staff
resources. The SECY paper further stated that the availability of staff resources for reviewing such exemptions
would be extremely limited. Subsequently, by letter dated August 15, 1994, the licensee withdrew the amendment request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the

 on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16864). However, by letter dated August 15, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under the link, CVSA will be able to hold securities in The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') through ISCC. Pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of the service agreement dated December 2, 1993, between ISCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and CVSA, CVSA will be bound by DTC rules applicable to the DTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services that CVSA will utilize through ISCC. While monetary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations under the link are expected to be limited to payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for fees, CVSA will be required to collateralize its obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ISCC. Such collateral will be available to cover any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments made by DTC to ISCC based on CVSA's use of DTC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. ISCC's auditors will be able to consult with CVSA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 auditors with regard to CVSA's financial condition and the activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arising under the link, and CVSA will furnish ISCC with CVSA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CVSA has agreed that before the link becomes operational, CVSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will appoint a registered agent in the U.S. for service of process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will provide ISCC with proof of such appointment. CVSA also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has agreed that it will be subject to jurisdiction in New York for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resolution of disputes under or arising from the link. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operationally, CVSA will be assigned one number for use on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of its members. ISCC will apply to DTC on CVSA's behalf to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish CVSA as an ISCC-sponsored DTC participant. ISCC on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of CVSA will initiate book-entry deliveries for no value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISCC on behalf of CVSA also will accept receives of securities by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
book-entry for no value. Both the receive and deliver functions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be pursuant to instructions received from CVSA, and such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions will identify, among other items, which CVSA member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for whom the receipt or delivery is being effected. In special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances and at ISCC's discretion, DTC's withdrawal-by-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer service also may be utilized. In such case, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
securities will be delivered as directed by CVSA. Relevant DTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices and corporate action data relating to the issues held in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CVSA/ISCC account at DTC will be provided to CVSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that any money settlement is required, ISCC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive payment in the form of an official bank check or a wire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer through the CVSA designated correspondent bank. ISCC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive dividend and possibly interest payments from DTC with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to shares on deposit. Dividend and interest credited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CVSA's account at DTC will be reflected in CVSA's ISCC settlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 statement.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The settlement statement also will reflect a debit for

of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder in that it will

promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ISCC's Rule 40 provides that ISCC may establish links with foreign financial institutions and may make available
for the benefit or on behalf of the foreign financial institution's participants and members such services of ISCC
which ISCC in its sole discretion shall determine to provide. Pursuant to the authority granted by Rule 40, ISCC has
entered into a link with MT.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 This link is similar to the links ISCC has previously established with the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation
and the Central Depository (Pte.) Ltd. of Singapore.

MT provides settlement and depository services for securities, including securities of U.S. issuers, listed on
Italian stock exchanges.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the link, MT will be able to hold securities in The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') through ISCC. Pursuant
to the terms of the service agreement dated June 1, 1992, between ISCC and MT, MT will be bound by DTC rules applicable
to the DTC services that MT will utilize through ISCC. While monetary obligations under the link are expected to be
limited to payments for fees, MT will be required to collateralize its obligations to ISCC. Such collateral will be
available to cover any assessments made by DTC to ISCC based on MT's use of DTC's services. ISCC's auditors will be able
to consult with MT's auditors with regard to MT's financial condition and the activity arising under the link, and
MT will furnish ISCC with MT's financial statements.

MT has agreed that before the link becomes operational, MT will appoint a registered agent in the U.S. for service of
process and will provide ISCC with proof of such appointment. MT also has agreed that it will be subject to jurisdiction
in New York for the resolution of disputes under or arising from the link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operationally, MT will be assigned one number for use on behalf of its members. ISCC will apply to DTC on MT's behalf
to establish MT as an ISCC-sponsored DTC participant. ISCC on behalf of MT will initiate book-entry deliveries for
no value. ISCC on behalf of MT also will accept receipts of securities by book-entry for no value. Both the receive and
deliver functions will be pursuant to instructions received from MT, and such instructions will identify, among
other items, the MT member for whom the receipt or delivery is being effected. In special circumstances and at ISCC's
discretion, DTC's withdrawal-by-transfer service also may be utilized. In such case, the securities will be delivered
as directed by MT. Relevant DTC notices and corporate action data relating to the issues held in the MT/ISCC account
at DTC will be provided to MT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that any money settlement is required, ISCC will receive payment in the form of an official bank check
or a wire transfer through the MT designated correspondent bank. ISCC will receive dividend and possibly interest
payments from DTC with respect to shares on deposit. Dividend and interest credited to MT's account at DTC will be reflected
in MT's ISCC settlement statement.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The settlement statement also will reflect a debit for the total dividends and interest paid to MT's account at its
withholding bank.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Iowa Department of Transportation and the Nebraska Department of Roads, will prepare
an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to reconstruct U.S. Route 34 (U.S. 34) between Interstate 29
in Iowa and U.S. Route 75 (U.S. 75) in Nebraska. The length of the project is approximately 10 km (6 miles).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary due to the narrow width and structural deficiency of the 65-year-old
bridge over the Missouri River. Additionally, the existing route, west of the bridge, traverses through downtown
and residential areas of Plattsmouth, Nebraska, on a low-speed alignment that restricts traffic flow, causes safety
problems, limits economic growth of the region, and routes heavy vehicles through the center of the city. Alternatives
under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) using alternative travel modes; (3) reconstruction on or near
the existing route; and (4) constructing a limited access highway on a new location. Incorporated into and studied
with the various build alternatives will be design variations of alignment and grade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate federal, state and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in
this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A series of public scoping meetings will be held at the Community Center, 625 Avenue ``A'' in Plattsmouth, Nebraska,
on September 27, 1994, and the Glenwood State Bank, 32 North Walnut, in Glenwood, Iowa, on September 28, 1994. Both
meetings will be held between 4 pm and 7 pm. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of
the time and place of the hearing. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the
public hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, projects must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''
should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle.

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA is interested in proposals that further the development of federalism in Russia at the regional level through
the establishment of long-term, comprehensive relationships between regional organizations/institutions in
the United States and their regional counterparts in Russia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects should examine the roles of national and regional governments that exist in a federated system of government
and focus on the tasks, responsibilities, and obligations charged to each. General program content will vary depending
on the regions involved. Issues of interest might include but are not limited to: The balance of power between federal
and regional governments; communication and coordination between regional and federal governments; regional
economic development and management; and regional resource management and environmental policy. Projects should
reflect the issues shared by the American and Russian regions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority will be given to projects that produce tangible, manageable results, i.e. a federalism curriculum for a
Russian institute/university, development of a regional association, development of a center/institute within
an existing Russian institution to study regional issues, development of Russian and American business/commercial
links, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Office of Citizen Exchanges 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is not interested in projects that are largely academic in nature (classroom lectures, structured course work, participation
in existing academic courses, etc.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA encourages applicants to design creative projects involving non-English speaking Russians for both in-country
and U.S.-based training. USIA is interested in proposals whose designs take into account the need for the continued
sharing of information and ongoing training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority will be given to those projects which include a resident American in Russia for a duration of at least three
months. Proposals that include U.S. specialists with background in Russia and some language will be given priority.
Priority will also be given to those projects which demonstrate concrete results at the end of program activity (conference
reports, ongoing exchanges, continued involvement of grantee organization in Russia, etc.). The goal of the program
is to create working relationships between Russian and American officials in areas of mutual interest in order to
form permanent professional and political partnerships between regional leaders and their respective institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA will give careful consideration to proposals which demonstrate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In-depth, substantive knowledge of the issues related to federalism in Russia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Established relations with Russian regional institutions/organizations and a demonstrated commitment
to continue such relationships following the conclusion of the grant period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The capacity to organize, manage, and administer a program of this magnitude on a regional level; including
conducting orientations for both American and Russian participants, arranging all logistical aspects of the program,
providing in-county support for participants prior to and following the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development of practical, written information in Russian relevant to the interests of Russian regional and
local officials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A clear and detailed method for participant selection. The proposal should clearly describe the type of person
who will participate and how that person will be selected. Grantee institutions are expected to develop slates of
candidates from which to choose the final participants. USIS Moscow retains the right to accept or deny any candidate

USIA encourages the development and use of written materials in Russian to increase the impact of the program. US government
funds, not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the total grant award, may be used to purchase and/or translate documents
and materials and to purchase the required software and hardware to achieve the goals of the project. In developing
written materials, consideration should be given to their wider use, beyond the Federalism in Russian Partnership
Program. USIA is interested in the multiple use of training materials through their dissemination to universities,
libraries, and other organizations for use by a larger audience.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision to submit a proposal should not be taken lightly. Competition for USIA funding is always keen and this
program is highly competitive. A USIA grant award should constitute only a portion of the total project funding. Proposals
should list and provide evidence of other anticipated sources of financial and in-kind support.

USIA requires that at least 50% of all outbound travel costs be provided by the American partner organization(s) with
non-federal funds. Russian partner organizations will be expected to provide for lodging, transportation, and

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote international Harmonisation of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed
to enhance Harmonisation and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for
pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of Harmonisation is to identify and then reduce differences in technical
requirements for drug development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite Harmonisation initiatives to be developed with technical
input from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and
others. ICH is concerned with Harmonisation of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers
from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a meeting held on March 10, 1994, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that a guideline entitled ``Notes for Guidance
on Specific Aspects of Regulatory Genotoxicity Tests'' should be made available for public comment. The draft guideline
is the product of the Safety Expert Working Group of the ICH. Comments about this draft will be considered by FDA and
the Expert Working Group. Ultimately, FDA intends to adopt the ICH Steering Committee's final guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft guideline is to be applied in conjunction with existing guidelines in the United States, Japan, and Europe.
No required battery of genetic toxicology tests has been adopted by FDA for pharmaceutical development in the United
States, pending completion of ICH negotiations on this topic. The test battery recommended by FDA's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition (58 FR 16536, March 29, 1993) for food additives, however, is currently preferred for
the evaluation of pharmaceuticals and is recommended to those seeking initial guidance in this area. This battery
is similar to that endorsed previously by the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pesticides Program (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 21:38&hyph;45, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft guideline recommends methods of testing pharmaceuticals for genetic toxicity. These recommendations
are based on historical information from the international pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies in the
European Community, Japan, and the United States, and scientific literature. In general, while there may be cause
for concern for mutagenic potential of certain biological products, the currently recommended tests should not
be routinely applied to such products. When there is cause for concern, specific endpoints should be identified and
relevant tests should be performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the
use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but are
acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, if the agency issues this
guideline in final form, the guideline would not be issued under the authority in current &sect;10.90(b), and would
not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person, nor would it operate to bind FDA in any
way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before December 6, 1994, submit written comments on the draft guideline to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The
draft guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the draft guideline follows:

Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Guidelines for the testing of pharmaceuticals for genetic toxicity exist in the European Community (EC, 1987) and
Japan (Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, 1989). FDA's Centers for Drug and Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CDER and CBER) currently consider the guidance on genetic toxicity testing provided by FDA's Center for Food Safety
and Applied Nutrition (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, March 29, 1993) to be applicable to pharmaceuticals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following notes for guidance should be applied in conjunction with existing guidelines in the three ICH regions.
The recommendations below are derived from considerations of historical information from the international pharmaceutical
industry, the three regulatory bodies, and the scientific literature. Where relevant, the recommendations from
the latest review of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines and the International
Workshop on Standardization of Genotoxicity Test Procedures held in Melbourne, Australia (February 1993) have
been considered. Information from the survey carried out by the Centre for Medicines Research on current practices
and strategies used by the pharmaceutical industry for genotoxicity testing (Purves, et al., 1994) has also been
considered.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

 strains cited in guidelines (normally TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100) will detect such changes at G&hyph;C sites
within target histidine genes. It is clear from the literature that some mutagenic carcinogens attack A&hyph;T base
pairs preferentially (e.g., Levin, 1982; Wilcox, et al., 1990; also see note 1). Therefore, the standard set of strains
used in bacterial mutation assays should include strains that will detect point mutations at A&hyph;T sites, such
as S.

B. Acceptable Bone Marrow Tests for the Detection of Clastogens In Vivo
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Tests measuring chromosomal aberrations in nucleated bone marrow cells in rodents can detect a wide spectrum of changes
in chromosomal integrity. These changes almost all result from breakage of one or more chromatids as the initial event.
Breakage of chromatids can result in micronucleus formation if an acentric fragment is produced; therefore, assays
detecting either chromosomal aberrations or micronuclei are acceptable for detecting clastogens (see note 3).
Micronuclei can also result from dislocation of chromosomes from the mitotic spindle, and, thus, micronucleus tests
have the potential to detect aneugenic compounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the analysis of either chromosomal aberrations or micronuclei in bone marrow cells

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 is acceptable for the detection of clastogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acceptability of the peripheral blood micronucleus assay as a substitute for the bone marrow micronucleus assay
is being actively considered (see note 4).

C. Guidance on the Further Evaluation of Compounds Giving In Vitro Positive Results
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 test system generates both false negative and false positive results in relation to predicting rodent carcinogenicity.
The test battery approach is designed to reduce the risk of false negative results. However, the genotoxicity test
batteries as described will only detect carcinogens that act primarily via a mechanism involving direct genetic
damage, such as the majority of known human carcinogens. According to the results of the National Toxicology Program
(Haseman, et al., 1990) and an analysis of results from tests of pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals in Japan
(Shimada, 1993), approximately 15 percent of carcinogens are not detected by the commonly used batteries of genotoxicity
tests. Therefore, a positive result in any assay for genotoxicity does not necessarily mean that the test compound
poses a genotoxic hazard to man. The following points should be considered when assessing

Positive results that are without apparent biological relevance should be excluded. These include the following
considerations (this list is not exhaustive, but is given as an aid to decisionmaking):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is the response clearly reproducible?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 mammalian cell genotoxicity assays unless the concentrations tested induce some degree of cytotoxicity. It is also
apparent that at very low survival levels, mechanisms other than direct genotoxicity per se can lead to `positive'
results that are related to cytotoxicity and not genotoxicity (e.g., events associated with apoptosis, endonuclease
release from lysosomes, etc. (Kirkland, 1992)). Such events are likely to occur once a certain concentration threshold
is reached for a toxic compound.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To balance these conflicting considerations, the following levels of cytotoxicity are currently acceptable for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 cytogenetic tests using cell lines is defined as greater than 50 percent inhibition of cell proliferation or culture
confluency. For lymphocyte cultures, an inhibition of mitotic index by greater than 50 percent is considered sufficient.
The desired upper limit of toxicity for mammalian cell mutation tests should be at least 80 percent of the corresponding
control value. Toxicity can be measured either by assessment of cloning efficiency immediately after treatment,
suspension growth immediately after treatment, or by calculation of relative total growth.

(iii) Tests of poorly soluble compounds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There is some evidence that dose-related genotoxic activity can be detected when testing particular compounds in
the insoluble range. This is always associated with dose-related toxicity (see note 7). It is possible that solubilization
of a precipitate is enhanced by serum in the culture medium or in the presence of S9-mix constituents. It is also probable
that cell membrane lipid can facilitate absorption of lipophilic compounds into cells. In addition, some types of
mammalian cells are phagocytic (e.g., Chinese hamster V79, CHO and CHL cells) and can ingest solid particles which
may subsequently disperse into the cytoplasm. An insoluble compound may also contain soluble genotoxic impurities.
It should also be noted that some insoluble compounds are administered

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 as suspensions or as particulate materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heavy precipitates can interfere with scoring the desired parameter and render control of exposure very difficult
(e.g., where a centrifugation step(s) is included in a protocol to remove cells from exposure media) (see note 8),
or render the test compound unavailable to enter cells and interact with DNA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The following strategy is recommended for testing relatively insoluble compounds. The recommendation refers to
the test article in the culture medium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no toxicity is observed, the lowest precipitating concentration should be used as the top concentration. If dose-related
toxicity or mutagenicity is noted, irrespective of solubility, then the top concentration should be based on toxicity
as described above. It is recognized that the desired levels of cytotoxicity may not be achievable if the extent of
precipitation interferes with the scoring of the test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases, precipitation should be evaluated using the naked eye.

F. Use of Male/Female Rodents in Bone Marrow Micronucleus Tests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Extensive studies of the activity of known clastogens in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test have shown that,
in general, male mice are more sensitive than female mice for micronucleus induction (see note 9). Quantitative differences
in sensitivity to micronucleus induction have been identified between the sexes, but no qualitative differences
have been described. Where marked quantitative differences exist, there is invariably a difference in toxicity
between the sexes. If there is a clear qualitative difference in metabolites between male and female rodents, then
both sexes should be used in the micronucleus test. Similar principles can be applied for other established 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests (see note 10). Both rats and mice are deemed acceptable for use in the bone marrow mironucleus test (see note 11).
In summary, unless there are obvious differences in toxicity or metabolism between male and female rodents, males
alone are sufficient for use in bone marrow micronucleus tests. If gender- specific drugs are to be tested, the appropriate
sex should be used.

 but not by the standard set of four Salmonella strains. Although animal carcinogenicity data are not available on
these compounds, it is likely that such compounds would carry the same carcinogenic potential as mutagens-inducing
changes in the standard set of Salmonella strains.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) TA1537, TA97, and TA97a contain cytosine runs at the mutation-sensitive site within the relevant target histidine
loci and show similar sensitivity to frameshift mutagens that induce deletion of bases in these frameshift hotspots.
There was consensus agreement at the International Workshop on Standardization of Genotoxicity Procedures, Melbourne,
1993 (Gatehouse, et al., 1994) that all three strains could be used interchangeably, and that decision is endorsed
here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) As the mechanisms of micronucleus formation are related to those inducing chromosomal aberrations (e.g., Hayashi,
et al., 1984), both micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations can be accepted as assay systems to screen for clastogenicity
induced by test compounds. Comparisons of data where both the mouse micronucleus test and rat bone marrow metaphase
analysis have been carried out on the same compounds has shown impressive correlation both qualitatively, i.e.,
detecting clastogenicity, and quantitatively, e.g., determination of the lowest clastogenic dose. Even closer
correlations can be expected where the data are generated in the same species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The peripheral blood micronucleus test in the mouse using acridine orange supravital staining was introduced
by Hayashi, et al. (1990). The test has recently been the subject of a major collaborative study by the Japanese Collaborative
Study Group for the Micronucleus Test (see Mutation Research (1992) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, Nos. 2/3). The tests were carried out in CD-1 mice using 23 test substances of various modes of action. Peripheral
blood sampled from the same animal was examined 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours (or longer) after treatment. As a rule one chemical
was studied by 2 different laboratories (46 laboratories took part). All chemicals were detected as inducers of micronuclei.
There were quantitative differences between laboratories, but no qualitative differences. Most chemicals gave
the greatest response 48 hours after treatment. Thus, the results suggest that the peripheral blood assay using acridine
orange supravital staining can generate reproducible and reliable data to evaluate the clastogenicity of chemicals.
Based on these data, the Melbourne workshop concluded that this assay is equivalent in accuracy to the bone marrow
micronucleus assay.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 assays exists for the liver unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay. A review of the literature shows that a combination
of the liver UDS test and the bone marrow micronucleus test will detect most genotoxic carcinogens with few false positive
results (Tweats, 1994). Unstable genotoxins and certain aromatic amines are problematical for all existing

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 screens. The choice of a second test, however, should not be restricted to UDS tests because other assays may be more
appropriate (e.g.,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
P post-labelling, DNA strand-breakage assays, etc.), depending on the compound in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The bone marrow is a well-perfused tissue and it can be deduced therefore that levels of drug-related materials
in blood or plasma will be similar to those observed in bone marrow. This is supported by direct comparisons of drug
levels in the two compartments for a large series of different pharmaceuticals. Although drug levels are not always
the same, there is sufficient correlation for measurements in blood or plasma to be adequate for validating bone marrow
exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Laboratories in Japan carrying out genotoxicity tests have much experience in testing precipitates, and have
identified examples of substances that are clearly genotoxic only in the precipitating range of concentrations.
These compounds include polymers and mixtures of compounds, some polycyclic hydrocarbons, some phenylene diamines,
heptachlor, etc. Collaborative studies with some of these compounds have shown that they may be detectable in the
soluble range; however, it does seem clear that genotoxic activity increases well into the insoluble range. A discussion
of these factors is found in the report of the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'' subgroup of the Melbourne conference (Kirkland, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Testing compounds in the precipitating range is problematical with respect to defining the exposure periods
for assays where the cells grow in suspension. After the defined exposure period, the cells are normally pelleted
by centrifugation and are then resuspended in fresh medium without the test compound. If a precipitate is present,
the compound will be carried through to the later stages of the assay, making control of exposure impossible. If such
cells are used (e.g., human peripheral lymphocytes or mouse lymphoma cells), it is reasonable to use the lowest precipitating
concentration as the highest concentration tested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) As the induction of micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations are related, it is reasonable to assume that the same
conditions can be applied for using male animals in bone marrow chromosomal aberration assays. The peripheral blood
micronucleus test has been validated only in male rodents (The Collaborative Study Group for the Micronucleus Test,
1992), as has the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) A detailed collaborative study was carried out under the auspices of the Japanese Environmental Mutagen Society
(The Collaborative Study Group for the Micronucleus Test, 1986). This study indicated that, in general, male mice
were more sensitive than female mice for micronucleus induction; where differences were seen, they were only quantitative,
not qualitative. This analysis has been extended by the group considering the micronucleus test at the Melbourne
Harmonisation workshop and, having analyzed data on 53

(11) Both the rat and mouse are suitable species for use in the micronucleus test. However, data are accumulating to
show that some species-specific carcinogens are species-specific genotoxins (e.g., Albanese, et al., 1988). When
more data have accumulated, there may be a case for carrying out micronucleus tests in both the rat and the mouse.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote Harmonisation of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance
Harmonisation and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical
development. One of the goals of Harmonisation is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements
for drug development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite Harmonisation initiatives to be developed with input
from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others.
ICH is concerned with Harmonisation of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: the European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and IFPMA, as well as observers
from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 15, 1994, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that a consensus draft guideline entitled ``Impurities In New
Drug Substances,'' which was developed by the Quality Expert Working Group of the ICH, should be made available for
public comment. The draft guideline will be made available for comment by the European Commission and Japanese Ministry
of Health and Welfare, as well as by FDA, in accordance with their respective consultation procedures. Comments about
this draft will be considered by FDA and the Expert Working Group. Ultimately, FDA intends to adopt the ICH Steering
Committee's final guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft guideline is intended to provide guidance to applicants for drug marketing registration on the content
and qualification of impurities in new drug substances produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered
in a country, region, or member State. The draft guideline is not intended to apply to new drug substances used during
the clinical research stage of development or clinical trials. The draft guideline also does not apply to biological/biotechnological
substances, peptides, radiopharmaceuticals, fermentation and semisynthetic products derived from that process,
herbal products, and crude products of animal or plant origin. Impurities in new drug substances are addressed in
the draft guideline from two perspectives: (1) Chemistry aspects_classification and identification of impurities,
report generation, setting specifications, and a brief discussion of analytical procedures; and (2) safety aspects_guidance
for qualifying impurities that were not present in batches of the new drug substance used in safety and clinical studies
and/or impurity levels substantially higher than in those batches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the
use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that
are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, if the agency issues
this guideline in final form, the guideline would not be issued under the authority of current &sect;10.90(b), and
would not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person, nor would it operate to bind FDA
in any way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before December 6, 1994, to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) submit written
comments on the draft guideline . Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The
draft guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

1. Preamble
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This document is intended to provide guidance for registration applications on the content and qualification of
impurities in new drug substances produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered in a region or member
State. It is not intended to apply to the regulation of new drug substances used during the clinical research stage
of development, e.g., investigational new drugs or clinical trials exemptions. Biological/biotechnological,
peptide, radiopharmaceutical, fermentation, and semisynthetic products derived therefrom, herbal products,
and crude products of animal or plant origin are not covered. Impurities in new drug substances are addressed from
two perspectives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemistry aspects include classification and identification of impurities, report generation, setting specifications,
and a brief discussion of analytical procedures; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety aspects include specific guidance for qualifying impurities which were not present in batches of new drug
substance used in safety and clinical studies and/or impurity levels substantially higher than in those batches.
Threshold limits are described below which qualification should not be necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Classification of Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Impurities may be classified into the following categories:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic Impurities (Process and Drug Related)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inorganic Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residual Solvents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic impurities may arise during the manufacturing process and/or storage of the new drug substance. They may
be identified or unidentified, volatile or nonvolatile, and include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Starting Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By-Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intermediates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Degradation Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reagents, Ligands, and Catalysts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inorganic impurities may derive from the manufacturing process. They are normally known and identified and include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reagents, Ligands, and Catalysts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heavy Metals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inorganic Salts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other Materials (e.g., Filter Aids, Charcoal, etc.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solvents are organic or inorganic liquids used during the manufacturing process. Since these are generally of known
toxicity, the selection of appropriate controls is easily accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excluded from this document are: Extraneous contaminants which should not occur in new drug substances and are more
appropriately addressed as good manufacturing practice issues; polymorphic form, a solid state property of the
new drug substance; and enantiomeric impurities.

3. Rationale for the Reporting and Control of Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.1 Organic Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant should summarize those actual and potential impurities most likely to arise during the synthesis,
purification, and storage of the new drug substance. This summary should be based on sound scientific appraisal of
the chemical reactions involved in the synthesis, impurities associated with raw materials which could contribute
to the impurity profile of the new drug substance, and possible degradation products. This discussion need only include
those impurities that may reasonably be expected based on knowledge of the chemical reactions and conditions involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the applicant should summarize the laboratory studies conducted to detect impurities in the new drug
substance. This summary should include test results of batches manufactured during the development process and
batches from the proposed commercial process, as well as results of intentional degradation studies used to identify
potential impurities arising during storage. Assessment of the proposed commercial process may be deferred until
the first batch is produced for marketing. The impurity profile of the drug substance lots intended for marketing
should be compared with those used in development and any differences discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The studies conducted to characterize the structure of actual impurities present in the new drug substance at or above
an apparent level of 0.1 percent (e.g., calculated using the response factor of the drug substance) should be described.
Note that, identification of all recurring impurities at or above the 0.1 percent level is expected in batches manufactured
by the proposed commercial process. Degradation products observed in stability studies at labelled storage temperatures
should be similarly identified. When identification of an impurity is not feasible, a summary of the laboratory studies
demonstrating the unsuccessful effort should be included in the application. Where attempts have been made to identify
impurities below the 0.1 percent level, it is useful also to report the results of these studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identification of impurities below apparent levels of 0.1 percent is generally not considered necessary. However,
identification should be attempted for those potential impurities that are expected to be unusually potent, producing
toxic or pharmacologic effects at a level lower than 0.1 percent. In all cases, impurities should be qualified as described
later in this guideline. Although it is common practice to round analytical results of between 0.05 and 0.09 percent
to the nearest number (i.e., 0.1 percent), for the purpose of these guidelines, such values would not be rounded to
0.1 percent and these impurities would not require identification.

Inorganic impurities are normally detected and quantitated using pharmacopeial or other appropriate procedures.
Carry over of catalysts to the new drug substance should be evaluated during development. The need for inclusion or
exclusion of inorganic impurities in the new drug substance specifications should be discussed. Limits are based
on pharmacopeial standards of known safety data.

3.3 Solvents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The control of residues of the solvents used in the manufacturing process for the new drug substance should be discussed.
Any solvents which may appear in the drug substance should be quantified using analytical procedures with an appropriate
level of sensitivity. Pharmacopeial or other appropriate procedures should be utilized. Limits are based on pharmacopeial
standards or known safety data taking into consideration dose, duration of treatment, and route of administration.
Particular attention should be given to quantitation of toxic solvents used in the manufacturing process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Analytical Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The registration application should include documented evidence that the analytical procedures are validated
and suitable for the detection and quantitation of impurities. Differences in the analytical procedures used during
development and proposed for the commercial product should be discussed in the registration application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic impurity levels can be measured by a variety of techniques, including those which compare an analytical response
for an impurity to that of an appropriate reference standard or to the response of the new drug substance itself. Reference
standards used in the analytical procedures for control of impurities should be evaluated and characterized according
to their intended use. It is considered acceptable to use the drug substance to estimate the levels of impurities.
In cases where the response factors are not close, this practice may still be acceptable, provided a correction factor
is applied or the impurities are, in fact, being overestimated. Specifications and analytical procedures used to
estimate identified or unidentified impurities are often based on analytical assumptions (e.g., equivalent detector
response, etc.). The assumptions should be discussed in the registration application.

5. Reporting Impurity Content of Batches
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Analytical results should be provided for all batches of the new drug substance used for clinical, safety, and stability
testing, as well as batches representative of the proposed commercial process. The content of individual identified
and unidentified and total impurities, observed in these batches of the new drug substance, should be reported with
the analytical procedures indicated. A tabulation (e.g., spreadsheet) of the data is recommended. Impurities should
be designated by code number or by an appropriate descriptor, e.g., retention time. Levels of impurities which are
present but below the validated limit of quantitation need not be reported. When analytical procedures change during
development, reported results should be linked with the procedure used, with appropriate validation information
provided. Representative chromatograms should be provided. Chromatograms of such representative batches, from
methods validation studies showing separation and detectability of impurities (e.g., on spiked samples), along
with any other impurity tests routinely performed, can serve as the representative impurity profiles. The applicant
should ensure that complete impurity profiles (i.e., chromatograms) of individual batches are available if requested.
A tabulation should be provided which links the specific new drug substance batch to each safety study and each clinical
study in which it has been used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each batch of the new drug substance, the report should include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Batch Identity and Size
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Date of Manufacture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. Specification Limits for Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The specifications for a new drug substance should include limits for impurities. Stability studies, chemical development
studies, and routine batch analyses can be used to predict those impurities likely to occur in the commercial product.
The selection of impurities to include in the new drug substance specifications should be based on the impurities
found in batches manufactured by the proposed commercial process. Those impurities selected for inclusion in the
specifications for the new drug substance are referred to as ``specified impurities'' in these guidelines. Specified
impurities may be identified or unidentified and are individually listed in the new drug substance specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A rationale for the inclusion or exclusion of impurities in the specifications should be presented. This rationale
should include a discussion of the impurity profiles observed in the safety and clinical development batches together
with a consideration of the impurity profile of material manufactured by the proposed commercial process. Specific
identified impurities should be included along with recurring unidentified impurities estimated to be at or above
0.1 percent. For impurities known to be unusually potent or to produce toxic or unexpected pharmacological effects,
the sensitivity of the analytical methods should be commensurate with the level at which the impurities are to be controlled.
For unidentified impurities, the procedure used and assumptions made in establishing the level of the impurity should
be clearly stated. Unidentified impurities included in the specifications should be referred to by some appropriate
qualitative analytical descriptive label (e.g., ``unidentified A,'' ``unidentified with relative retention
of 0.9,'' etc.). Finally, a general specification limit of not more than 0.1 percent for any unspecified impurity
should be included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limits should be set no higher than the level which can be justified by safety data, and, unless safety data indicate
otherwise, no lower than the level achievable by the manufacturing process and the analytical capability. In other
words, where there is no safety concern, impurity specifications are based on data generated on actual batches of
the new drug substance allowing sufficient latitude to deal with normal manufacturing and analytical variation,
and the stability characteristics of the new drug substance. Although normal manufacturing variations are expected,
significant variation in batch-to-batch impurity levels may indicate that the manufacturing process of the new
drug substance is not adequately controlled and validated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the new drug substance specifications should include, where applicable, limits for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Specified Identified Impurity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Specified Unidentified Impurity at or above 0.1 percent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any Unspecified Impurity, with a limit of not more than 0.1 percent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residual Solvents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inorganic Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summation of assay value and impurity levels can be used to obtain mass balance for the test sample. The mass balance
need not add to exactly 100 percent because of the analytical error associated with each analytical procedure. The
summation of impurity levels plus the assay value may be misleading, e.g., when the assay procedure is nonspecific
(e.g., potentiometric titrimetry) and the impurity level is relatively high.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Qualification of Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Qualification is the process of acquiring and evaluating data which establishes the biological safety of an individual
impurity or a given impurity profile at the level(s) specified. The applicant should provide a rationale for selecting
impurity limits based on safety considerations. The level of any impurity present in a new drug substance which has
been adequately tested in safety and/or clinical studies is considered qualified. Impurities which are also significant
metabolites present in animal and/or human studies do not need further qualification. A level of a qualified impurity
higher than that present in a new drug substance can also be justified based on an analysis of the actual amount of impurity
administered in previous safety studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If data are not available to qualify the proposed specification level of an impurity, studies to obtain such data may
be needed when the usual qualification threshold limits given below are exceeded:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 lower).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
0.05 percent.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</TABLE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Higher or lower threshold limits for qualification of impurities may be appropriate for some individual drugs based
on scientific rationale and level of concern, including drug class effects and clinical experience. For example,
qualification may be especially important when there is evidence that such impurities in certain drugs or therapeutic
classes have previously been associated with adverse reactions in patients. In these instances, a lower qualification
threshold limit may be appropriate. Conversely, a higher qualification threshold limit may be appropriate for individual
drugs when the level of concern for safety is less than usual based on similar considerations (patient population,
drug class effects, clinical considerations, etc.). Technical factors (manufacturing capability and control
methodology) may be considered as part of the justification for selection of alternative threshold limits. Proposals
for alternative threshold limits are considered on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Decision Tree for Safety Studies'' (Attachment I) describes considerations for the qualification of impurities
when thresholds are exceeded. In some cases, decreasing the level of impurity below the threshold may be simpler than
providing safety data. Alternatively, adequate data may be available in the scientific literature to qualify an
impurity. If neither is the case, additional safety testing should be considered. The studies desired to qualify
an impurity will depend on a number of factors, including the patient population, daily dose, route, and duration
of drug administration. Such studies are normally conducted on the new drug substance containing the impurities
to be controlled, although studies using isolated impurities are acceptable.

 If general toxicity studies are desirable, study(ies) should be designed to allow comparison of unqualified to qualified
material. The study duration should be based on available relevant information and performed in the species most
likely to maximize the potential to detect the toxicity of an impurity. In general, a minimum duration of 14 days and
a maximum duration of 90 days will be acceptable.

8. New Impurities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
During the course of a drug development program, the qualitative impurity profile of the new drug substance may change,
or a new impurity may appear as a result of synthetic route changes, process optimization, scale-up, etc. New impurities
may be identified or unidentified. Such changes call for consideration of the need for qualification of the level
of the impurity unless it is below the threshold values as noted above. When a new impurity exceeds the threshold, the
``Decision Tree for Safety Studies'' should be consulted. Safety studies should compare the new drug substance containing
a representative level of the new impurity with previously qualified material, although studies using the isolated
impurity are also acceptable (these studies may not always have clinical relevance).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote international Harmonisation of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed
to enhance Harmonisation and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for
pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of Harmonisation is to identify and then reduce differences in technical
requirements for drug development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite Harmonisation initiatives to be developed with input
from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others.
ICH is concerned with Harmonisation of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (IFPMA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers
from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Harmonisation of reproductive toxicology testing was selected as a priority topic during the early stages of the
ICH initiative. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 16, 1993 (58 FR 21074), FDA published a draft tripartite guideline entitled, ``Guideline on Detection of
Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products.'' The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit
comments by May 17, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the comments received and revisions to the guideline, a final draft of the guideline was submitted
to the ICH Steering Committee in June 1993 and endorsed by the three participating regulatory agencies. The final
guideline was subsequently presented at the second ICH meeting held in October 1993. The guideline provides information
applicable to sponsors submitting applications to both CDER and CBER. Sponsors submitting future applications
may be asked to explain differences from the approach suggested in the guideline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help facilitate understanding of the guideline, the agency is providing further clarification of important questions
that have been raised since initial general distribution of the document at ICH 2 by both industry and regulatory scientists.

General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First pass tests in the guideline are those tests that will likely be performed as general screens (i.e., the three-study
design or ``most probable option'') to identify potential treatment related effects. Secondary tests are those
designed to characterize, e.g., the nature, scope, and/or origin of the toxic effect. In general, repeated dose general
toxicity studies of 2 to 4 weeks duration may provide a close approximation of the doses to be used in the reproductive
toxicology studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Male Fertility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the introduction to the guideline, studies are ongoing to optimize parameters to be used in fertility
studies, including the optimal treatment period for males prior to mating, histological techniques for the evaluation
of sex organs, and techniques to evaluate sperm. It is expected that, in most cases, viability will be measured indirectly
by evaluating sperm motility. A variety of methods will be acceptable to evaluate sperm, including vital dye staining,
flow cytometric analysis, and nonautomated and automated methods to measure the percent of motile sperm. Sponsors
should justify the methods used and define the objective criteria established to assess the data obtained. It is expected
that improvements in methods to assess male reproductive performance will evolve over the next few years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The design of the study of fertility (ICH 4.1.1) assumes that, especially for effects on spermatogenesis, use will
be made of data from repeated dose toxicity studies of at least 1-month duration. The agency encourages the use of good
pathological and histopathological examination techniques in the repeated dose toxicity studies in addition to
the staging of spermatogenesis which is routinely employed. The preservation of testes and epididymides from all
animals from ICH study 4.1.1 provides an opportunity for more detailed histopathological examination on a case-by-case
basis; for example, if unexpected effects on sperm count or viability are observed. There may be cases due to species-specific
effects or technical considerations (e.g., multiple samplings are required overtime) when sperm evaluation in
nonrodents may be more appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The duration of pretreatment for males in ICH study 4.1.1 is 4 weeks, unless data from other studies suggest that this
should be modified. Males should be treated throughout the mating period (generally between 2 and 3 weeks) and at least
through implantation of the females. Thus, males will generally be sacrificed following at least 7 to 9 weeks dosing.
Evaluations should generally include organ weights and macroscopic examinations of testis, epididymis, seminal
vesicle, and prostate. Sperm counts and sperm viability (e.g., motility) should be assessed. Tissues should be saved
for potential histological assessment, as such assessments may be required on a case-by-case basis. If histological
data are not available from previous studies or the quality of the data are dubious, then histological evaluation
should be performed in this study.

Prenatal and Postnatal Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When studying the effect on postnatal development, the reduction of litter size by culling is still under discussion.
If culling is performed, it should be randomized. Whether or not it is performed, it should be explained by the investigator.
Observations on offspring in ICH study 4.1.2 include sensory functions and reflexes and behavior, consistent with
previous guidelines from Japan and the European Union. Specific functional tests have not been recommended in the
ICH guideline. Investigators are encouraged to use methods that will assess sensory functions, motor activity,
learning, and memory to help characterize functional deficits in offspring. Under the terminology section of the
guideline, a three-generation study is defined as direct exposure of the F0 generation, indirect and direct exposure
of the F1 and F2, and indirect exposure of the F3 generation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the
use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but are
acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not being
issued under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits
for or on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with all of FDA's guidelines, the public is encouraged to submit written comments with new data or other new information
pertinent to this guideline. The comments in the docket will be periodically reviewed, and, where appropriate, the
guideline will be amended. The public will be notified of any such amendments through a notice in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, at any time, submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to
be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Guideline on Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medical Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1 Purpose of the Guideline
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a considerable overlap in the methodology that could be used to test chemicals and medicinal products for
potential reproductive toxicity. As a first step to using this wider methodology for efficient testing, this guideline
attempts to consolidate a strategy based on study designs currently in use for testing of medicinal products; it should
encourage the full assessment on the safety of chemicals on the development of the offspring. It is perceived that
tests in which animals are treated during defined stages of reproduction better reflect human exposure to medicinal
products and allow more specific identification of stages at risk. While this approach may be useful for most medicines,
long-term exposure to low doses does occur and may be represented better by a one- or two-generation study approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual testing strategy should be determined by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Anticipated drug use especially in relation to reproduction,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The form of the substance and route(s) of administration intended for humans, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Making use of any existing data on toxicity, pharmacodynamics, kinetics, and similarity to other compounds in structure/activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To employ this concept successfully, flexibility is needed (Note 1). No guideline can provide sufficient information
to cover all possible cases. All persons involved should be willing to discuss and consider variations in test strategy
according to the state-of-the-art and ethical standards in human and animal experimentation. Areas where more basic
research would be useful for optimization of test designs are male fertility assessment, and kinetic and metabolism
in pregnant/lactating animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2 Aim of Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The aim of reproduction toxicity studies is to reveal any effect of one or more active substance(s) on mammalian reproduction.
For this purpose, both the investigations and the interpretation of the results should be related to all other pharmacological
and toxicological data available to determine whether potential reproductive risks to humans are greater, lesser,
or equal to those posed by other toxicological manifestations. Further, repeated dose toxicity studies can provide
important information regarding potential effects on reproduction, particularly male fertility. To extrapolate
the results to humans (assess the relevance), data on likely human exposures, comparative kinetics, and mechanisms
of reproductive toxicity may be helpful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combination of studies selected should allow exposure of mature adults and all stages of development from conception
to sexual maturity. To allow detection of immediate and latent effects of exposure, observations should be continued
through one complete life cycle, i.e., from conception in one generation through conception in the following generation.
For convenience of testing this integrated sequence can be subdivided into the following stages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Premating to conception (adult male and female reproductive functions, development and maturation of gametes,
mating behavior, fertilization).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Conception to implantation (adult female reproductive functions, preimplantation development, implantation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Implantation to closure of the hard palate (adult female reproductive functions, embryonic development, major
organ formation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Closure of the hard palate to the end of pregnancy (adult female reproductive functions, fetal development and
growth, organ development and growth).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Birth to weaning (adult female reproductive functions, neonate adaption to extrauterine life, preweaning development
and growth).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Weaning to sexual maturity (postweaning development and growth, adaption to independent life, attainment of
full sexual function).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For timing conventions see Note 2.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.3 Choice of Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The guideline addresses the design of studies primarily for detection of effects on reproduction. When an effect
is detected, further studies to characterize fully the nature of the response have to be designed on a case-by-case
basis (Note 3). The rationale for the set of studies chosen should be given and should include an explanation for the
choice of dosages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies should be planned according to the ``state-of-the art,'' and take into account preexisting knowledge of
class-related effects on reproduction. They should avoid suffering and should use the minimum number of animals
necessary to achieve the overall objectives. If a preliminary study is performed, the results should be considered
and discussed in the overall evaluation (Note 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Animal Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The animals used should be well defined with respect to their health, fertility, fecundity, prevalence of abnormalities,
embryofetal deaths, and the consistency they display from study to study. Within and between studies, animals should
be of comparable age, weight, and parity at the start; the easiest way to fulfill these criteria is to use animals that
are young, mature adults at the time of mating with the females being virgin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1 Selection and Number of Species
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies should be conducted in mammalian species. It is generally desirable to use the same species and strain as in
other toxicological studies. Reasons for using rats as the predominant rodent species are practicality, comparability
with other results obtained in this species and the large amount of background knowledge accumulated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In embryotoxicity studies only, a second mammalian species traditionally has been required, the rabbit being the
preferred choice as a ``nonrodent.'' Reasons for using rabbits in embryotoxicity studies include the extensive
background knowledge that has accumulated, as well as availability and practicality. Where the rabbit is unsuitable,
an alternative nonrodent or a second rodent species may be acceptable and should be considered on a case-by-case basis
(Note 5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.2 Other Test Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Other test systems are considered to be any developing mammalian and nonmammalian cell systems, tissues, organs,
or organism cultures developing independently in vitro or in vivo. Integrated with whole animal studies either for
priority selection within homologous series or as secondary investigations to elucidate mechanisms of action,
these systems can provide invaluable information and, indirectly, reduce the numbers of animals used in experimentation.
However, they lack the complexity of the developmental processes and the dynamic interchange between the maternal
and the developing organisms. These systems cannot provide assurance of the absence of effect nor provide perspective
in respect of risk/exposure. In short, there are no alternative test systems to whole animals currently available
for reproduction toxicity testing with the aims set out in the introduction (Note 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
3. General Recommendations Concerning Treatment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.1 Dosages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection of dosages is one of the most critical issues in design of the reproductive toxicity study. The choice of
the high dose should be based on data from all available studies (pharmacology, acute and chronic toxicity and kinetic
studies, Note 7). A repeated dose toxicity study of about 2 to 4 weeks duration provides a close approximation to the
duration of treatment in segmental designs of reproductive studies. When sufficient information is not available,
preliminary studies are advisable (see Note 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having determined the high dosage, lower dosages should be selected in a descending sequence, the intervals depending
on kinetic and other toxicity factors. Whilst it is desirable to be able to determine a ``no observed adverse effect
level,'' priority should be given to setting dosage intervals close enough to reveal any dosage-related trends that
may be present (Note 8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.2 Route and Frequency of Administration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In general the route or routes of administration should be similar to those intended for human usage. One route of substance
administration may be acceptable if it can be shown that a similar distribution (kinetic profile) results from different
routes (Note 9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The usual frequency of administration is once daily but consideration should be given to use either more frequent
or less frequent administration taking kinetic variables into account (see also Note 10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.3 Kinetics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is preferable to have some information on kinetics before initiating reproduction studies since this may suggest
the need to adjust choice of species, study design, and dosing schedules. At this time, the information need not be
sophisticated nor derived from pregnant or lactating animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of study evaluation, further information on kinetics in pregnant or lactating animals may be required
according to the results obtained (Note 10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.4 Control Groups
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is recommended that control animals be dosed with the vehicle at the same rate as test group animals. When the vehicle
may cause effects or affect the action of the test substance, a second (sham- or untreated) control group should be
considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Proposed Study Designs_Combination of Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All available pharmacological, kinetic, and toxicological data for the test compound and similar substances should
be considered in deciding the most appropriate strategy and choice of study design. It is anticipated that, initially,
preference will be given to designs that do not differ too radically from those of established guidelines for medicinal
products (the most probable option). For most medicinal products, the three-study design will usually be adequate.
Other strategies, combinations of studies, and study designs could be as valid or more valid as the ``most probable
option'' according to circumstances. The key factor is that, in total, they leave no gaps between stages and allow
direct or indirect evaluation of all stages of the reproductive process (Note 11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designs should be justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4.1 The Most Probable Option
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The most probable option can be equated to a combination of studies for effects on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Fertility and early embryonic development,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Embryo-fetal development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4.1.1 Study of Fertility and Early Embryonic Development to Implantation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Aim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To test for toxic effects/disturbances resulting from treatment from before mating (males/females) through mating
and implantation. This comprises evaluation of stages A and B of the reproductive process (see 1.2). For females this
should detect effects on the oestrous cycle, tubal transport, implantation, and development of preimplantation
stages of the embryo. For males it will permit detection of functional effects (e.g., on libido, epididymal sperm
maturation) that may not be detected by histological examinations of the male reproductive organs (Note 12).

Assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Maturation of gametes,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Mating behavior, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Fertility,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Preimplantation stages of the embryo, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Implantation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Animals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
At least one species, preferably rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Number of Animals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of animals per sex per group should be sufficient to allow meaningful interpretation of the data (Note 13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Administration Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The design assumes that, especially for effects on spermatogenesis, use will be made of data from repeated dose toxicity
studies of at least 1-month duration. Provided no effects have been found that preclude this, a premating treatment
interval of 2 weeks for females and 4 weeks for males can be used (Note 12). Selection of the length of the premating administration
period should be stated and justified (see also 1.1, pointing out the need for research). Treatment should continue
throughout mating to termination of males and at least through implantation for females. This will permit evaluation
of functional effects on male fertility that cannot be detected by histologic examination in repeated dose toxicity
studies and effects on mating behavior in both sexes. If data from other studies show there are effects on weight or
histologic appearance of reproductive organs in males or females, or if the quality of examinations is dubious or
if there are no data from other studies, then a more comprehensive study should be designed (Note 12).

Males may be sacrificed at any time after mating but it is advisable to ensure successful induction of pregnancy before
taking such an irrevocable step (Note 15).

To detect adverse effects on the pregnant/lactating female and on development of the conceptus and the offspring
following exposure of the female from implantation through weaning. Since manifestations of effect induced during
this period may be delayed, observations should be continued through sexual maturity (i.e., stages C to F listed in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To detect adverse effects on the pregnant female and development of the embryo and fetus consequent to exposure of
the female from implantation to closure of the hard palate (i.e., stages C to D listed in 1.2).

Animals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Usually, two species: one rodent, preferably rats; one nonrodent, preferably rabbits (Note 5). Justification should
be provided when using one species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of animals should be sufficient to allow meaningful interpretation of the data (Note 13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Administration Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The treatment period extends from implantation to the closure of the hard palate (i.e., end of C, see 1.2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Experimental Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Females should be sacrificed and examined about 1 day prior to parturition. Eleven fetuses should be examined for
viability and abnormalities. To allow subsequent assessment of the relationship between observations made by different
techniques fetuses should be individually identified (Note 22).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When using techniques requiring allocation to separate examination for soft tissue or skeletal changes, it is preferable
that 50 percent of fetuses from each litter be allocated for skeletal examination. A minimum of 50 percent rat fetuses
should be examined for visceral alterations, regardless of the technique used. When using fresh microdissection
techniques for soft tissue alterations_which is the strongly preferred method for rabbits_100 percent of rabbit
fetuses should be examined for soft tissue and skeletal abnormalities.

4.2 Single Study Design (rodents)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the dosing period of the fertility study and prenatal and postnatal study are combined into a single investigation,
this comprises evaluation of stages A to F of the reproductive process (see 1.2). If such a study, if it includes fetal
examinations, provided clearly negative results at sufficiently high exposure, no further reproduction studies
in rodents should be required. Fetal examinations for structural abnormalities can also be supplemented with an
embryo-fetal development study (or studies) to make a two-study approach (Notes 3 and 11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results from a study for effects on embryo-fetal development in a second species are expected (see also 4.1.3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4.3 Two Study Design (rodents)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The simplest two-segment design would consist of the fertility study and the prenatal and postnatal development
study, if it includes fetal examinations. It can be assumed, however, that if the prenatal and postnatal development
study provided no indication of prenatal effects at adequate margins above human exposure, the additional fetal
examinations (see 4.1.3) are most unlikely to provide a major change in the assessment of risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, female treatment in the fertility study (4.1.1) could be continued until closure of the hard palate
and fetuses examined according to the procedures of the embryo-fetal development study (4.1.3). This, combined
with the prenatal and postnatal study (4.1.2) would provide all the examinations required in ``the most probable
option'' but use considerably less animals (Notes 3 and 11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results from a study for effects on embryo-fetal development in a second species are expected (see also 4.1.3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Statistics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of the statistics of a study is the means by which results are interpreted. The most important part of this
analysis is to establish the relationship between the different variables and their distribution (descriptive
statistics), because these determine how groups should be compared. The distributions of the endpoints observed
in reproductive tests are usually nonnormal and extend from almost continuous to the extreme categorical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When employing inferential statistics (determination of statistical significance) the mating pair or litter,
not the fetus or neonate, should be used as the basic unit of comparison. The tests used should be justified (Note 23).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Data Presentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The key to good reporting is the tabulation of individual values in a clear concise manner to account for every animal
that was entered into the study. A reader should be able to follow the history of any individual animal from initiation
to termination and should be able to deduce with ease the contribution that the individual has made to any group summary
values. Group summary values should be presented in a form that is biologically plausible (i.e., avoid false precision)
and that reflects the distribution of the variable. Appendices or tabulations of individual values such as bodyweight,
food consumption, litter values should be concise and, as far as possible, consist of absolute rather than calculated
values; unnecessary duplication should be avoided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For tabulation of low frequency observations such as clinical signs, autopsy findings, abnormalities, etc., it
is advisable to group together the (few) individuals with a positive recording. Especially in the presentation of
data on structural changes (fetal abnormalities) the primary listing (tabulation) should clearly identify the
litters containing abnormal fetuses, identify the affected fetuses in the litter, and report all the changes observed
in the affected fetus. Secondary listings by type of change can be derived from this, if necessary.

7. Terminology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Besides effects on the reproductive competence of adult animals toxicity to reproduction includes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Developmental toxicity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: Any adverse effect induced prior to attainment of adult life. It includes effects induced or manifested in the embryonic
or fetal period and those induced or manifested postnatally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: Any adverse effect on the conceptus resulting from prenatal exposure, including structural or functional abnormalities
or postnatal manifestations of such effects. Terms like ``embryotoxicity'' or ``fetotoxicity'' relate to the timepoint/-period
of induction of adverse effects, irrespective of the time of detection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
One-, two-, or three-generation studies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: Are defined according to the number of adult breeding generations directly exposed to the test material. For example,
in a one-generation study there is direct exposure of the F0 generation and indirect exposure (via the mother) of the
F1 generation, and the study is usually terminated at the weaning of the F1 generation. In a two-generation study as
used for agro-chemicals and industrial chemicals there is direct exposure of the F0 generation, indirect and direct
exposure of the F1 generation and indirect exposure of the F2 generation. A three-generation study is defined accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Body burden
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: The total internal dosage of an individual arising from the administration of a substance, comprising parent compound
and metabolites, taking distribution and accumulation into account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Kinetics
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: The term ``kinetics'' is used consistently throughout this guideline, irrespective of intending to mean pharmaco-
and/or toxicokinetics. No better single term was available.

Note 1 (1.1) Scientific Flexibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These guidelines are not mandatory rules, they are a starting point rather than an endpoint. They provide a basis from
which an investigator can devise a strategy for testing according to available knowledge of the test material and
the state-of-the art. For encouragement, some alternative test designs have been mentioned in this document but
there are others that can be sought out or devised. In devising a strategy, the primary objective should be to detect
and bring to light any indication of toxicity to reproduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fine details of study design and technical procedures have been omitted from the text. Such decisions rightly belong
in the field of the investigator since a technique that may be suitable for one laboratory may not be suitable in another.
The investigator needs to utilize staff and resources to do the best he or she can achieve and should know how to do this
better than any outsider; human attributes of attitude, ability, and consistency are more important than material
facilities. For necessary compliance to good laboratory practices (GLP), reference is made to such regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Note 2 (1.2) Timing Conventions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In this guideline the convention for timing of pregnancy is to refer to the day that a sperm-positive vaginal smear
and/or plug is observed as day 0 of pregnancy even if mating occurs overnight. Unless shown otherwise it is assumed
that, for rats, mice and rabbits implantation occurs on day 6-7 of pregnancy, and closure of the hard palate on day 15-18
of pregnancy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other conventions are equally acceptable if defined in reports. Also, the investigator should be consistent in different
studies to ensure that no gaps in treatment occur. It is an advisable precaution to provide an overlap of at least 1 day
in the exposure period of related studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accuracy of the time of mating should be specified because this will affect the variability of fetal and neonatal
parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, for reared litters, the day offspring are born will be considered as postnatal or lactation day 0 unless
otherwise specified. However, particularly with regard to delays in, or prolongation of, parturition, reference
to a postcoital timeframe may be useful.

Note 3 (1.3) First Pass and Secondary Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To a greater or lesser degree, all first pass (guideline) tests are apical in nature, i.e., an effect on one endpoint
may have several different origins. A reduced litter size at birth may be due to a reduced ovulation rate (corpora lutea
count), higher rate of preimplantation deaths, higher rate of postimplantation deaths, or immediate postnatal
deaths. In turn, these deaths may be the consequence of an earlier physical malformation that can no longer be observed
due to subsequent secondary changes and so on. Particularly for effects with a natural low frequency among controls,
discrimination between treatment-induced and coincidental occurrence is dependent upon association with other
types of effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A toxicant usually induces more than one type of effect in a dose-dependent manner. For example, induction of malformation
is almost invariably associated with increased embryonic death and an increased incidence of less severe structural
changes. Given an effect on one endpoint, secondary investigations for possible associations should be considered,
i.e., the nature, scope, and origins of the substance's toxicity should be characterized. Characterization should
also include identification of dose-response relationships to facilitate risk assessment; this is different from
the situation in first pass tests where the presence or absence of a dose response assists discrimination between
treatment-related and coincidental differences.

Note 4 (1.3) Preliminary Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time most reproduction studies are planned or initiated there is usually information available from acute
and repeated dose toxicity studies of at least 1-month duration. This information can be expected to be sufficient
in identifying doses for reproductive studies. If adequate preliminary studies are performed, they are part of the
justification of the choice of dose for the main study. Such studies should be submitted regardless of their GLP-status
in principle. This may avoid unnecessary use of animals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Note 5 (2.1) Selection of Species and Strains
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In choosing an animal species and strain for reproductive toxicity testing, care should be given to select a relevant
model. Selection of the species and strain used in other toxicology studies may avoid the need for additional preliminary
studies. If it can be shown_by means of kinetic, pharmacological, and toxicological data_that the species selected
is a relevant model for the human, a single species can be sufficient. There is little value in using a second species
if it does not show the same similarities to humans. Advantages and disadvantages of species (strains) should be considered
in relation to the substance to be tested, the selected study design, and in the subsequent interpretation of the results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All species have their advantages. Rats, and to a lesser extent mice, are good general purpose models; the rabbit has
been somewhat neglected as a ``nonrodent'' species for repeated dose toxicity and other reproduction studies than
embryotoxicity testing. It has attributes that would make it a useful model for fertility studies, especially male
fertility. For both rabbits and dogs (which are often used as a second species for chronic toxicity studies) it is feasible
to obtain semen samples without resorting to painful techniques (electro ejaculation) for longitudinal semen analysis.
Most of the other species are not good, general purpose models and probably are best used for very specific investigations
only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All species have their disadvantages, for example:

Note 6 (2.2) Uses of Other Test Systems Than Whole Animals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Other tests systems have been developed and used in preliminary investigations (``prescreening'' or priority selection)
and secondary testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For preliminary investigation of a range of analogue series of substances, it is essential that the potential outcome
in whole animals is known for at east one member of the series to be studied (by inference, effects are expected). With
this strategy, substances can be selected for higher level testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For secondary testing or further substance characterization, other test systems offer the possibility to study
some of the observable developmental processes in detail, e.g., to reveal specific mechanisms of toxicity, to establish
concentration-response relationships, to select `sensitive periods,' or to detect effects of defined metabolites.

Note 7 (3.1) Selection of Dosages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Using similar doses in the reproductive toxicity studies as in the repeated dose toxicity studies will allow interpretation
of any potential effects on fertility in context with general systemic toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some minimal toxicity is expected to be induced in the high-dose dams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the specific compound, factors limiting the high dosage determined from repeat dose toxicity studies
or from preliminary reproduction studies could include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Reduction in bodyweight gain;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Increased bodyweight gain, particularly when related to perturbation of homeostatic mechanisms;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Specific target organ toxicity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Haematology, clinical chemistry;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Exaggerated pharmacological response, which may or may not be reflected as marked clinical reactions (e.g., sedation,
convulsions);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The physico-chemical properties of the test substance or dosage formulation which, allied to the route of administration,
may impose practical limitations in the amount that can be administered; under most circumstances 1 gram per kilogram
per day (g/kg/day) should be an adequate limit dose;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Kinetics can be useful in determining high-dose exposure for low toxicity compounds; there is, however, little point
in increasing administered dosage if it does not result in increased plasma or tissue concentration; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Marked increase in embryo-fetal lethality in preliminary studies.

Note 8 (3.1) Determination of Dose-Response Relationships
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For many of the variables in reproduction studies the power to discriminate between random variation and treatment
effect is poor and the presence or absence of a dosage-related trend can be a critical means of determining the probability
of a treatment effect. It has to be kept in mind that in these studies dose responses may be steep, and wide intervals
between doses would be inadvisable. If an analysis of dose-response relationships for the effects observed is attempted
in a single study, it is recommended to use at least three dose levels and appropriate control groups. If in doubt, a
fourth dose group should be added to avoid excessive dosage intervals. Such a strategy should provide a ``no observed
adverse effect level'' for reproductive aspects. If not, the implication is that the test substance merits a greater
depth of investigation and further studies.

Note 9 (3.2) Exposure by Different Routes of Administration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If it can be shown that one route provides a greater body burden, e.g., area under the curve (AUC), there seems little
reason to investigate routes that would provide a lesser body burden or which present severe practical difficulties
(e.g. inhalation). Before designing new studies for a new route of administration, existing data on kinetics should
be used to determine the necessity of another study.

Note 10 (3.3) Kinetics in Pregnant Animals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Kinetic investigations in pregnant and lactating animals may pose some problems due to the rapid changes in physiology.
It is best to consider this as a two- or three-phase approach. In planning studies kinetic data (often from nonpregnant
animals) provide information on the general suitability of the species, and can assist in deciding study designs
and choice of dosage. During a study kinetic investigations can provide assurance of accurate dosing or indicate
marked deviations from expected patterns.

Note 11 (4) Examples for Choosing Other Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For compounds causing no lethality at 2 g/kg and no evidence of repeated dose toxicity at 1 g/kg, conduct of a single
two-generation study with one control and two test groups (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) would seem sufficient. However, it might
pose the question as to whether the correct species had been chosen or whether the compound was an effective medicine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For compounds that may be given as a single dose, once in a lifetime (e.g., diagnostics, medicines used in operations),
it may be impossible to administer repeated dosages more than twice the human therapeutic dosage for any length of
time. A reduced period of treatment allowing a higher dose would seem more appropriate. For females, considerations
of human exposure suggest little or no need for exposures beyond the embryonic period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For dopamine agonists or compounds reducing circulating prolactin levels, female rats are poor models; the rabbit
would probably make a better choice for all the reproductive toxicity studies, but it does not appear to have been attempted.
This also applies to other types of compound when the rabbit shows a pattern of metabolism considerably closer to humans
than the rat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For drugs where alterations in plasma kinetics are seen following repeated administration, the potential for adverse
effects on embryo-fetal development may not be fully evaluated in studies according to 4.1.3. In such cases it may
be desirable to extend the period of drug administration to females in a 4.1.1 study to day 17. With sacrifice at term,
both fertility and embryo-fetal development can be assessed.

Note 12 (4.1.1) Premating Treatment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The design of the fertility study, especially the reduction in the premating period for males, is based on evidence
accumulated and reappraisal of the basic research on the process of spermatogenesis that originally prompted the
demand for a prolonged premating treatment period. Compounds inducing selective effects on male reproduction are
rare; mating with females is an insensitive means of detecting effects on spermatogenesis; good pathological and
histopathological examination (e.g., by employing Bouin's fixation, paraffine embedding, transverse sections
of 2 to 4 microns for testes, longitudinal sections for epididymides, PAS, and haematoxylin staining) of the male
reproductive organs provides a more sensitive and quicker means of detecting effects on spermatogenesis; compounds
affecting spermatogenesis almost invariably affect postmeiotic stages; there is no conclusive example of a male
reproductive toxicant the effects of which could be detected only by dosing males for 9 to 10 weeks and mating them with
females.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on potential effects on spermatogenesis can be derived from repeated dose toxicity studies. This allows
the investigations in the fertility study to be concentrated on other, more immediate, causes of effect. It is noted
that the full sequence of spermatogenesis (including sperm maturation) in rats lasts 63 days. When the available
evidence, or lack of it, suggests that the scope of investigations in the fertility study should be increased, or extended
from detection to characterization, appropriate studies should be designed to further characterize the effects.

Note 13 (4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3) Number of Animals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There is very little scientific basis underlying specified group sizes in past and existing guidelines nor in this
one. The numbers specified are educated guesses governed by the maximum study size that can be managed without undue
loss of overall study control. This is indicated by the fact that the more expensive the animal is to obtain or keep,
the smaller the group size proposed. Ideally, at least the same group size should be required for all species and there
is a case for using larger group sizes for less frequently used species such as primates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be made clear that the numbers required depend on whether or not the group is expected to demonstrate
an effect. For a high frequency effect few animals are required, to presume the absence of an effect the number required
varies according to the variable (endpoint) being considered, its prevalence in control populations (rare or categorical
events), or dispersion around the central tendency (continuous or semicontinuous variables). See also Note 23.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all but the rarest events (such as malformations, abortions, total litter loss), evaluation of between 16 to 20
litters for rodents and rabbits tends to provide a degree of consistency between studies. Below 16 litters per evaluation,
between study results become inconsistent, above 20 to 24 litters per group, consistency and precision are not greatly
enhanced. These numbers relate to evaluation. If groups are subdivided for different evaluations the number of animals
starting the study should be doubled. Similarly, in studies with 2 breeding generations, 16 to 20 litters would be
required for the final evaluation of the litters of the F1 generation. To allow for natural wastage, the starting group
size of the F0 generation must be larger.

Mating ratios
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: When both the sexes are being dosed or are of equal consideration in separate male and female studies, the preferred
mating ratio is 1:1 because this is the safest option in respect of obtaining good pregnancy rates and avoiding incorrect
analysis and interpretation of results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Mating period and practices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: Most laboratories would use a mating period of between 2 and 3 weeks, some remove females as soon as a positive vaginal
smear or plug is observed whilst others leave the pairs together. Most rats will mate within the first 5 days of cohabitation
(i.e., at the first available estrus), but in some cases females may become pseudopregnant. Leaving the female with
the male for about 20 days allows these females to restart estrus cycles and become pregnant.

Females
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When exposure of the females ceases at implantation, termination of females between days 13 and 15 of pregnancy in
general is adequate to assess effects on fertility or reproductive function, e.g., to differentiate between implantation
and resorption sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, for detection of adverse effects, it is not thought necessary, in a fertility study, to sacrifice females
at day 20/21 of pregnancy in order to gain information on late embryo loss, fetal death, and structural abnormalities.

It would be advisable to delay sacrifice of the males until the outcome of mating is known. In the event of an equivocal
result, males could be mated with untreated females to ascertain their fertility or infertility. The males treated
as part of study 4.1.1 may also be used for evaluation of toxicity to the male reproductive system if dosing is continued
beyond mating and sacrifice delayed.

Daily weighing of pregnant females during treatment can provide useful information. Weighing an animal more frequently
than twice weekly during periods other than pregnancy (premating, mating, lactation) may also be advisable for some
compounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For apparently nonpregnant rats or mice (but not rabbits), ammonium sulphide staining of the uterus might be useful

The guideline suggests selection of one male and one female per litter on the evidence that it is feasible to conduct
behavioral and other functional tests on the same F1 individuals that will be used for assessment of reproductive
function. This has the advantage of allowing cross referencing of performance in different tests at the individual
level. It is recognized, however, that some laboratories prefer to select separate sets of animals for behavior testing
and for assessment of reproductive function. Which is the most suitable for an individual laboratory will depend
upon the combination of tests used and the resources available.

Note 21 (4.1.2) Physical Development, Sensory Functions, Reflexes, and Behavior
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The best indicator of physical development is bodyweight. Achievement of preweaning landmarks of development such
as pinna unfolding, coat growth, incisor eruption, etc., is highly correlated with pup bodyweight. This weight is
better related to postcoital time than postnatal time, at least when significant differences in gestation length
occur. Reflexes, surface righting, auditory startle, air righting, and response to light are also dependent on physical
development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two postweaning landmarks of development that are advised are vaginal opening of females and cleavage of the balanopreputial
gland of males. The latter is associated with increasing testosterone levels whereas testis descent is not. These
landmarks indicate the onset of sexual maturity and it is advised that bodyweight be recorded at the time of attainment
to determine whether any differences from control are specific or related to general growth.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Functional tests
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: To date, functional tests have been directed almost exclusively to behavior. Even though a great deal of effort has
been expended in this direction it is not possible to recommend specific test methods. Investigators are encouraged
to find methods that will assess sensory functions, motor activity, learning, and memory.

Note 22 (4.1.3) Individual Identification and Evaluation of Fetuses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It must be possible to relate all findings by different techniques (i.e., body weight, external inspection, visceral,
and/or skeletal examinations) to single specimen in order to detect patterns of abnormalities. The examination
of mid- and low-dose fetuses for visceral and/or skeletal abnormalities may not be necessary where the evaluation
of the high-dose and the control groups did not reveal any relevant differences. It is advisable, however, to store
the fixed specimen for possible later examination. If fresh dissection techniques are normally used, difficulties
with later comparisons involving fixed fetuses should be anticipated.

Note 23 (5) Inferential Statistics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Significance'' tests (inferential statistics) can be used only as a support for the interpretation of results.
The interpretation itself is to be based on biological plausibility. It is unwise to assume that a difference from
control values is not biologically relevant simply because it is not ``statistically significant.'' To a lesser
extent it can be unwise to assume that a ``statistically significant'' difference must be biologically relevant.
Particularly for low frequency events (e.g., embryonic death, malformations) with one-sided distributions, the
statistical power of studies is low. Confidence intervals for relevant quantities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 can indicate the likely size of the effect. When using statistical procedures, experimental units of comparison
should be considered: the litter, not the individual conceptus, the mating pair, when both sexes are treated, the
mating pair of the parent generation in a two-generation study.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations
to promote international Harmonisation of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed
to enhance Harmonisation and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized regulatory requirements
for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of Harmonisation is to identify and then reduce differences in technical
requirements for drug development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite Harmonisation initiatives to be developed with input
from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others.
ICH is concerned with Harmonisation of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products
among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission,
the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare,
the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Researchers of America, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers
from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 At a meeting held on March 23 and 24, 1992, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that the draft tripartite guideline entitled
``Draft Tripartite Guideline for the Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products'' should be made available
for comment. Subsequently, the draft guideline was made available for comment by the European Union and Japan, as
well as by FDA (see 58 FR 21086, April 16, 1993), in accordance with their consultation procedures. The comments were
analyzed and the guideline was revised as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 With this notice, FDA is publishing a final guideline entitled ``Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.''
This guideline has been endorsed by all ICH sponsors. The guideline addresses the generation of stability information
for submission to FDA in NDA's for new molecular entities and associated drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This guideline may be useful immediately to applicants submitting NDA's to FDA. Sponsors submitting future applications
may be asked to explain any differences from the approach suggested in this guideline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Additional ICH stability documents will be appended to this harmonized guideline when they have been finalized.
FDA intends to update its 1987 guideline entitled ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of
Human Drugs and Biologics'' to incorporate the new elements arising from the ICH process and other changes in stability
testing that have occurred since 1987. For example, the updated guideline may include information and guidance on
stability issues for investigational new drug applications, stability parameters for different dosage forms,
recommendations for statistical analysis, stability testing for generic drugs, stability testing for biological
and biotechnological products, and stability data presentation formats. Certain aspects of the updated guideline
will also apply to products subject to licensing under the Public Health Service Act (biological products) and submitted
to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Until the 1987 guideline is updated as needed and ICH sections are incorporated, FDA intends to provide both the ICH
harmonized guideline, as contained in this notice, and the 1987 FDA guideline when information pertaining to stability
testing of human drug and biological products is requested. At a future date, FDA may issue a new guideline publication
that combines the guideline contained in this

 notice with a revised 1987 FDA guideline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the
use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that
are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not
being issued under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits
for or on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As with all of FDA's guidelines, the public is encouraged to submit written comments with new data or other new information
pertinent to this guideline. The comments in the docket will be periodically reviewed, and where appropriate, the
guideline will be amended. The public will be notified of any such amendments through a notice in the

 Interested persons may, at any time, submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address
above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to
be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Preamble
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following guideline sets out information on stability testing for a Registration Application within the three
areas of the EC, Japan, and the USA. It does not seek necessarily to cover the testing that may be required for registration
in or export to other areas of the world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline seeks to exemplify the core stability data package appropriate for new drug substances and products.
It is not always necessary to follow this when there are scientifically justifiable reasons for using alternative
approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline provides a general indication of the information on product stability to be generated, but leaves sufficient
flexibility to encompass the variety of different practical situations required for specific scientific situations
and characteristics of the materials being evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The principle that information on stability generated in any one of the three areas of the EC, Japan, and the USA would
be mutually acceptable in both of the other two areas has been established, provided it conforms to the elements of
this guideline and the labelling is in accord with national/regional requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Details of the specific requirements for sampling, test requirements for particular dosage forms/packaging, etc.,
are not covered in this guideline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
 Objective
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of stability testing is to provide evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or drug product varies
with time under the influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light, and
enables recommended storage conditions, retest periods, and shelf lives to be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The guideline primarily addresses the generation of stability information for submission in Registration Applications
for new molecular entities and associated drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This guideline does not currently seek to cover the generation of stability information for abbreviated or abridged
applications, variations, clinical trial applications, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of test conditions defined in this guideline is based on an analysis of the effects of climatic conditions
in the three areas of the EC, Japan, and the USA. The mean kinetic temperature in any region of the world can be derived
from climatic data (Grimm, W.,

General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Information on the stability of the drug substance is an integral part of the systematic approach to stability evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Stress Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Stress testing helps to determine the intrinsic stability of the molecule by establishing degradation pathways
in order to identify the likely degradation products and to validate the stability indicating power of the analytical
procedures used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Formal Studies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Primary stability studies are intended to show that the drug substance will remain within specification during the
retest period if stored under recommended storage conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection of Batches
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Stability information from accelerated and long-term testing is to be provided on at least three batches. The long-term
testing should cover a minimum of 12 months duration on at least three batches at the time of submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The batches manufactured to a minimum of pilot plant scale should be by the same synthetic route and use a method of manufacture
and procedure that simulates the final process to be used on a manufacturing scale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on stability should be representative of both the quality
of the material used in preclinical and clinical studies and the quality of material to be made on a manufacturing scale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supporting information may be provided using stability data on batches of drug substance made on a laboratory scale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The first three production batches of drug substance manufactured postapproval, if not submitted in the original
Registration Application, should be placed on long-term stability studies using the same stability protocol as
in the approved drug application.

Test Procedures and Test Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The testing should cover those features susceptible to change during storage and likely to influence quality, safety,
and/or efficacy. Stability information should cover as necessary the physical, chemical, and microbiological
test characteristics. Validated stability-indicating testing methods should be applied. The need for extent of
replication will depend on the results of validation studies.

Specification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Limits of acceptability should be derived from the profile of the material as used in the preclinical and clinical
batches. It will need to include individual and total upper limits for impurities and degradation products, the justification
for which should be influenced by the levels observed in material used in preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Storage Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The length of the studies and the storage conditions should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent
use. Application of the same storage conditions as applied to the drug product will facilitate comparative review
and assessment. Other storage conditions are allowable if justified. In particular, temperature sensitive drug
substances should be stored under an alternative, lower temperature condition which will then become the designated
long-term testing storage temperature. The 6 months accelerated testing should then be carried out at a temperature

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The design of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance
and evaluating the stability information (covering as necessary the physical, chemical, and microbiological test
characteristics), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the bulk drug substance manufactured under
similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production
batch will remain within specification until the retest date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 An acceptable approach for quantitative characteristics that are expected to decrease with time is to determine
the time at which the 95 percent one-sided confidence limit for the mean degradation curve intersects the acceptable
lower specification limit. If analysis shows that the batch to batch variability is small, it is advantageous to combine
the data into one overall estimate and this can be done by first applying appropriate statistical tests (for example,
p values for level of significance of rejection of more than 0.25) to the slopes of the regression lines and zero time
intercepts for the individual batches. If it is inappropriate to combine data from several batches, the overall retest
period may depend on the minimum time a batch may be expected to remain within acceptable and justified limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of any degradation relationship will determine the need for transformation of the data for linear regression
analysis. Usually the relationship can be represented by a linear, quadratic, or cubic function on an arithmetic
or logarithmic scale. Statistical methods should be employed to test the goodness of fit of the data on all batches
and combined batches (where appropriate) to the assumed degradation line or curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the
requested retest period will be granted. Under the circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal
statistical analysis but merely to provide a full justification for the omission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited extrapolation of the real time data beyond the observed range to extend expiration dating at approval time,
particularly where the accelerated data support this, may be undertaken. However, this assumes that the same degradation
relationship will continue to apply beyond the observed data and hence the use of extrapolation must be justified
in each application in terms of what is known about the mechanism of degradation, the goodness of fit of any mathematical
model, batch size, existence of supportive data, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any evaluation should cover not only the assay, but the levels of degradation products and other appropriate attributes.

 A storage temperature range may be used in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements. The range should
be based on the stability evaluation of the drug substance. Where applicable, specific requirements should be stated,
particularly for drug substances that cannot tolerate freezing. The use of terms such as ``ambient conditions''
or ``room temperature'' is unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A retest period should be derived from the stability information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Stability information from accelerated and long-term testing is to be provided on three batches of the same formulation
and dosage form in the containers and closure proposed for marketing. Two of the three batches should be at least pilot
scale. The third batch may be smaller (e.g., 25,000 to 50,000 tablets or capsules for solid oral dosage forms). The
long-term testing should cover at least 12 months duration at the time of submission. The manufacturing process to
be used should meaningfully simulate that which would be applied to large scale batches for marketing. The process
should provide product of the same quality intended for marketing, and meeting the same quality specification as
to be applied for release of material. Where possible, batches of the finished product should be manufactured using
identifiably different batches of drug substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on laboratory scale batches are not acceptable as primary stability information. Data on associated formulations
or packaging may be submitted as supportive information. The first three production batches manufactured postapproval,
if not submitted in the original Registration Application, should be placed on accelerated and long-term stability
studies using the same stability protocols as in the approved drug application.

Test Procedures and Test Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The testing should cover those features susceptible to change during storage and likely to influence quality, safety,
and/or efficacy. Analytical test procedures should be fully validated and the assays should be stability-indicating.
The need for the extent of replication will depend on the results of validation studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The range of testing should cover not only chemical and biological stability but also loss of preservative, physical
properties and characteristics, organoleptic properties, and, where required, microbiological attributes.
Preservative efficacy testing and assays on stored samples should be carried out to determine the content and efficacy
of antimicrobial preservatives.

Limits of acceptance should relate to the release limits (where applicable), to be derived from consideration of
all the available stability information. The shelf life specification could allow acceptable and justifiable derivations
from the release specification based on the stability evaluation and the changes observed on storage. It will need
to include specific upper limits for degradation products, the justification for which should be influenced by the
levels observed in material used in preclinical studies and clinical trials. The justification for the limits proposed
for certain other tests such as particle size and/or dissolution rate will require reference to the results observed
for batch(es) used in bioavailability and/or clinical studies. Any differences between the release and shelf life
specifications for antimicrobial preservatives should be supported by preservative efficacy testing.

Other storage conditions are allowable if justified. Heat sensitive drug products should be stored under an alternative
lower temperature condition which will eventually become the designated long-term storage temperature. Special
consideration may need to be given to products which change physically or even chemically at lower storage conditions,
e.g., suspensions or emulsions which may sediment or cream, oils, and semi-solid preparations which may show an increased
viscosity. Where a lower temperature condition is used, the 6 months accelerated testing should be carried out at
a temperature at least 15

Storage under conditions of high relative humidities applies particularly to solid dosage forms. For products such
as solutions, suspensions, etc., contained in packs designed to provide a permanent barrier to water loss, specific
storage under conditions of high relative humidity is not necessary but the same range of temperatures should be applied.
Low relative humidity (e.g., 10&hyph;20 percent RH) can adversely affect products packed in semi-permeable containers
(e.g., solutions in plastic bags, nose drops in small plastic containers, etc.) and consideration should be given
to appropriate testing under such conditions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A systematic approach should be adopted in the presentation and evaluation of the stability information which should
cover, as necessary, physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological quality characteristics, including
particular properties of the dosage form (for example, dissolution rate for oral solid dose forms). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The design of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug product, a
shelf- life and label storage instructions applicable to all future batches of the dosage form manufactured and packed
under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future
production batch will remain within specification until the expiration date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An acceptable approach for quantitative characteristics that are expected to decrease with time is to determine
the time at which the 95 percent one-sided confidence limit for the mean degradation curve intersects the acceptable
lower specification limit. If analysis shows that the batch to batch variability is small, it is advantageous to combine
the data into one overall estimate and this can be done by first applying appropriate statistical tests (for example,
p values for level of significance of rejection of more than 0.25) to the slopes of the regression lines and zero time
intercepts for the individual batches. If it is inappropriate to combine data from several batches, the overall shelf
life may depend on the minimum time a batch may be expected to remain within acceptable and justified limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the degradation relationship will determine the need for transformation of the data for linear regression
analysis. Usually the relationship can be represented by a linear, quadratic or cubic function on an arithmetic or
logarithmic scale. Statistical methods should be employed to test the goodness of fit on all batches and combined
batches (where appropriate) to the assumed degradation line or curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the data show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that
the requested shelf life will be granted, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis
but only to provide a justification for the omission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited extrapolation of the real time data beyond the observed range to extend expiration dating at approval time,
particularly where the accelerated data support this, may be undertaken. However, this assumes that the same degradation
relationship will continue to apply beyond the observed data and hence the use of extrapolation must be justified
in each application in terms of what is known about the mechanisms of degradation, the goodness of fit of any mathematical
model, batch size, existence of supportive data, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any evaluation should consider not only the assay, but the levels of degradation products and appropriate attributes.
Where appropriate, attention should be paid to reviewing the adequacy of the mass balance, different stability,
and degradation performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stability of the drug products after reconstituting or diluting according to labelling should be addressed to
provide appropriate and supportive information.

A storage temperature range may be used in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements. The range should
be based on the stability evaluation of the drug product. Where applicable, specific requirements should be stated
particularly for drug products that cannot tolerate freezing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of terms such as ``ambient conditions'' or ``room temperature'' is unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There should be a direct linkage between the label statement and the demonstrated stability characteristics of the
drug product.

Accelerated Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies designed to increase the rate of chemical degradation or physical change of an active drug substance or drug
product by using exaggerated storage conditions as part of the formal, definitive, storage programme.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These data, in addition to long-term stability studies, may also be used to assess longer term chemical effects at
nonaccelerated conditions and to evaluate the impact of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions
such as might occur during shipping. Results from accelerated testing results are not always predictive of physical
changes.

Bracketing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The design of a stability schedule so that at any time point only the samples on the extremes, for example, of container
size and/or dosage strengths, are tested. The design assumes that the stability of the intermediate condition samples
is represented by those at the extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a range of dosage strengths is to be tested, bracketing designs may be particularly applicable if the strengths
are very closely related in composition (e.g., for a tablet range made with different compression weights of a similar
basic granulation, or a capsule range made by filling different plug fill weights of the same basic composition into
different size capsule shells). Where a range of sizes of immediate containers is to be evaluated, bracketing designs
may be applicable if the material of composition of the container and the type of closure are the same throughout the
range.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This concept is a useful scientific guide for evaluating data but it is not achievable in all circumstances. The focus
may instead be on assuring the specificity of the assay, the completeness of the investigation of routes of degradation,
and the use, if necessary, of identified degradants as indicators of the extent of degradation via particular mechanisms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Matrixing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The statistical design of a stability schedule so that only a fraction of the total number of samples are tested at any
specified sampling point. At a subsequent sampling point, different sets of samples of the total number would be tested.
The design assumes that the stability of the samples tested represents the stability of all samples. The differences
in the samples for the same drug product should be identified as, for example, covering different batches, different
strengths, different sizes of the same container and closure, and, possibly, in some cases, different container/closure
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Matrixing can cover reduced testing when more than one variable is being evaluated. Thus the design of the matrix will
be dictated by the factors needing to be covered and evaluated. This potential complexity precludes inclusion of
specific details and examples, and it may be desirable to discuss design in advance with the Regulatory Authority,
where this is possible. In every case it is essential that all batches are tested initially and at the end of the long-term
testing.

These studies are undertaken to elucidate intrinsic stability characteristics. Such testing is part of the development
strategy and is normally carried out under more severe conditions than those used for accelerated tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stress testing is conducted to provide data on forced decomposition products and decomposition mechanisms for the
drug substance. The severe conditions that may be encountered during distribution can be covered by stress testing
of definitive batches of drug substance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies should establish the inherent stability characteristics of the molecule, such as the degradation
pathways, and lead to identification of degradation products and hence support the suitability of the proposed analytical
procedures. The detailed nature of the studies will depend on the individual drug substance and type of drug product.

Results from these studies will form an integral part of the information provided to regulatory authorities.

Light testing should be an integral part of stress testing. (The standard conditions for light testing are still under
discussion and will be considered in a further ICH document.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that some degradation pathways can be complex and that under forcing conditions decomposition products
may be observed which are unlikely to be formed under accelerated or long-term testing. This information may be useful
in developing and validating suitable analytical methods, but it may not always be necessary to examine specifically
for all degradation products, if it has been demonstrated that in practice these are not formed.

Data other than primary stability data, such as stability data on early synthetic route batches of drug substance,
small scale batches of materials, investigational formulations not proposed for marketing, related formulations,
product presented in containers and/or closures other than those proposed for marketing, information regarding
test results on containers, and other scientific rationale that support the analytical procedures, the proposed
retest period or shelf life and storage conditions.

This guideline has been developed within the Expert Working Group (Quality) of the International Conference on Harmonisation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussions are still being pursued within the Expert Working Group to define and standardize the conditions for
light stability testing of active substances and dosage forms and the requirements for biological/biotechnological
drug substances and products. Once agreed, these conditions will be the subject of a separate document.
