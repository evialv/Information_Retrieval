SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to govern the collection of debts owed to the
United States which arose from transactions involving OPM's administrative accounts. These regulations implement
the debt collection procedures provided under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act). The Act authorizes the Federal
Government to collect debts by means of administrative offset from other payments due the debtor from the United States,
without the debtor's consent, provided that the debtor is properly notified and given the opportunity to exercise
certain administrative rights. OPM's collection of debts due the Retirement and Insurance Group for payment to the
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Employees' Life Insurance Fund, the Retired Federal Employees Health
Benefits Fund, or the Employees' Health Benefits Fund is governed by other regulatory provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365) codified at 31 U.S.C. 3701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
makes several changes in the way Executive and Legislative agencies collect debts owed the Government. The purpose
of the Act is to improve the ability of the Government to collect monies owed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, administrative offset may be initiated when the head of an agency determines that an individual or entity
is indebted to the United States, or is notified by the head of another agency that a person or entity is indebted to the
United States and that the debtor is owed monies by the United States as a result of transactions with a Federal agency.
After the debtor has received certain due process rights, the debt may be collected by administratively offsetting
the debt against the amount due.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Act, before the Government may collect a debt by administrative offset, a debtor must be provided with notice
that a debt is owed, the opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt, the option to enter
into a written repayment agreement, and an opportunity for review of the agency's determination concerning the existence
of the amount of the debt, or the repayment terms. The debtor must notify the agency of his or her intent to exercise these
rights within time periods prescribed in these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act permits the agency to initiate an administrative offset prior to the completion of the due process requirements
if failure to do so would substantially jeopardize the agency's ability to collect the debt and if the time remaining
before payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of the due process procedures. Such prior offset
must be followed by completion of the due process procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires agencies to issue regulations for administrative offset. This final rule establishes the procedures
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will follow in making an administrative offset from funds paid to a debtor
from OPM's administrative accounts. These regulations apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States
arising from transactions with OPM other than those involving payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and
Disability Fund (the Fund) or where a request for an offset from OPM's administrative accounts_other than the Fund_is
received by OPM from another Federal Agency. Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance
Group to recover a debt from the Fund are provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations. These regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on administrative
offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR 102.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM has determined that this document is interpretative because it implements a definitive statutory scheme and
the requirements contained in regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office.
Accordingly, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). In addition, because this
rule relates to agency management and personnel, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
553(a)(2). For these reasons, a delayed effective date is not required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2).

Analysis and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interim Rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 60991). The comment period closed on January 18, 1994. Two labor organizations responded
with comments. OPM has fully considered all of their comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179.303&blank;General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter cited 28 U.S.C. 2415 to question the validity of the time allowed for commencing actions brought by the
United States (6 years rather than 10 years). Section (i) of 28 U.S.C. 2415 states: ``The provisions of this section
shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by
means of administrative offset, in accordance with section 3716 of title 31.'' That provision precludes agencies
from initiating offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued,
with certain exceptions explained in that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179.305&blank;Agency Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter expressed concern that the discretion allowed to suspend transactions in an alleged debtor's account
pending resolution of an appeal (179.305(c)) would have a ``chilling effect on such appeals by depriving appellants
of funds that would otherwise be available to them.'' The intent of the regulations is to suspend transactions in the
account(s) to the extent of the debt owed unless there is evidence of fraud. The language has been modified to clarify
that intent.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter requested that we add to the same section: ``Upon lifting the suspension *&blank;*&blank;* any
payments, removals, or transfers, as well as lost interest or discounts due to the debtor that had been precluded due
to temporary suspension of transactions in any of the debtor's accounts shall be applied retroactively to cover the
period of suspension.'' This authority is not stated in the Debt Collection Act, and without specific authority,
OPM is not authorized to take this action.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter requested an increase in the amount of time allowed for submission of a financial statement from 10 business
days to 30 business days (i.e., from 2 weeks to 6 weeks) ``to allow the debtor sufficient time to accurately prepare
the financial statement.'' OPM feels that 10 business days is adequate for the average debtor to present a statement
of his or her finances. An audited financial statement is not required. Exceptions will have to be considered on a case-by-case
basis.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter wished to add ``with interest'' at the end of the paragraph. The Debt Collection Act of 1982 requires the
assessment of interest, penalty fees, and administrative costs on delinquent debts as a means of strengthening enforcement
of collections; however, it makes no provision to pay interest to the debtor for erroneous collections. OPM is not
authorized to make such payments in the absence of a specific statute or authority permitting such payments.

Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance Group to recover a debt from the Fund are
provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations
are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on Administrative Offset issued jointly by the Department

(a) The Director or his or her designee, after attempting to collect a debt from a person under section 3(a) of the Federal
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset subject
to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The debt is certain in amount; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is in the best interest of the United States to collect the debt by administrative offset because it is less costly
and speeds payment of the debt;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Director, or his or her designee, may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to
another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency, or his or
her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process
rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Director, or his or her designee, may request another agency that holds funds payable to an OPM debtor to offset
the debt against the funds held and will provide certification that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The debt exists; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the 6-year period for bringing action on a debt provided in 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, then administrative offset
may be used to collect the debt only if the costs of bringing such action are likely to be less than the amount of the debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years
unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been
known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting such debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) These regulations do not apply to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another
statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Debts owed to OPM by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local government.

provide:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A description of the nature and amount of the debt and the intention of OPM to collect the debt through administrative
offset;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of OPM with respect to the debt;

opportunity to negotiate a written agreement for the repayment of the debt. If the financial condition of the debtor
does not support the ability to pay in one lump-sum, reasonable installments may be considered. No installment arrangement
will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting
the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within 10 business
days of OPM's request for the statement. At OPM's option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety
may be required for the installment agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or
compromise of a claim will be governed by 4 CFR part 103 and 31 U.S.C. 3711.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to govern the collection of debts owed to OPM's
administrative accounts by Federal employees. These regulations implement the debt collection procedures provided
under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act). The Act authorizes the Federal Government to collect debts by means of
offset from the salaries of Federal employees without the employee's consent, provided that the employee is properly
notified and given the opportunity to exercise certain administrative rights. OPM's collection of debts due the
Retirement and Insurance Group for payment to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Employees' Life
Insurance Fund, the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund, or the Employees' Health Benefits Fund is governed
by other regulatory provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act) Pub. L. 97&hyph;365) codified at 5 U.S.C. 5514, makes several changes
in the way Executive and Legislative agencies collect debts owed the Government. The purpose of the Act is to improve
the ability of the Government to collect monies owed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, when the head of an agency determines that an employee of any agency is indebted to the United States,
or is notified by the head of another agency that an agency employee is indebted to the United States, the employee's
debt may be offset against his/her pay. Before agencies may use the salary offset recovery procedure, certain due
process rights must be extended to the debtor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Government may collect a debt by salary offset, an employee-debtor must be provided with notice of the debt
and the opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt, enter into a written repayment agreement,
and request an impartial hearing on the determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt.
The employee must notify the agency of his/her intent to exercise these rights within the time period prescribed in
the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires agencies to issue regulations for salary offset. This final rule establishes the procedures the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will follow in making a salary offset. OPM has determined that this document
is interpretative; it implements a definitive statutory scheme and the requirements contained in regulations promulgated
by OPM, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Accordingly, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). In addition, because this rule relates to agency management and personnel, no Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). For these reasons, a delayed effective date is not required
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2).

Analysis and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interim Rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 60993). The comment period closed on January 18, 1994. Two labor organizations responded
with comments. OPM has fully considered all of their comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179.201&blank;Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentor requested that we change the 10 years in the second sentence (i.e., the time allowed for commencing actions
brought by the United States) to 6 years. They cited no basis for the request. Section 179.201 is based on 31 U.S.C. 3716
which precludes agencies from initiating offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right
to collect the debt first accrued, with certain exceptions explained in that section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a commenter, we corrected the reference ``Section 179.207, Notice Requirement'' to ``Section 179.207,
Hearing.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(16) One commenter wished to insert ``with interest'' after the word ``employee'' in this sentence. While the
Debt Collection Act of 1982 requires the assessment of interest, penalty fees, and administrative costs on delinquent
debts as a means of strengthening enforcement of collections, it makes no provision to pay interest to the debtor for
erroneous collections. OPM is not authorized to make such payments in the absence of a specific statute or authority.
This reasoning applies also to the same comment regarding section 179.215 Refunds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Both commenters objected to the perceived inequity in treatment of parties who fail to appear (&sect;179.207(j)).
We have inserted the following language:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

One commenter suggested several other changes to this section, &sect;&sect;179.208 and 179.209 but provided no
bases for the changes. Since the regulation as published complies with requirements of the Debt Collection Act of
1982, the suggested changes were not made.

Purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365), is to provide a comprehensive statutory approach
to the collection of debts due the Federal Government. These regulations implement section 5 of the Act which authorizes
the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset, except that
no claim may be collected by such means if outstanding for more than 10 years after the agency's right to collect the
debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known, and could not reasonably
have been known, by the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection
of such debts. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on July 3, 1984 (49 FR 27470) in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to
be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the
hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing
official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time
to submit documentation.

 An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that
the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity
is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing.
Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:

 In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for
the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. If the
representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled
and make his/her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by
both parties. With the agreement of both parties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date. Both parties
shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing.

Voluntary repayment agreement as alternative to salary offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt by making voluntary installment
payments as an alternative to salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit
in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement
must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Be in writing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Specify all the terms of the arrangement for payment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result
in a deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to
deduction of a greater amount (5 CFR 550.1104(i)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any proposal under paragraph (a) of this section must be received by the official designated in the notice of intent
within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The creditor agency will review a timely and properly submitted repayment proposal by the employee debtor and
notify the employee whether the proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the creditor
agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have
15 days from the date he or she received notice of that decision to file a petition for a hearing or a special review as
provided by &sect;179.210. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement
must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency designee and meet the other requirements of
this section for a voluntary repayment agreement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An OPM employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special
review by the Office of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances
such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (food,
housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting
documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Income from all sources;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
If an OPM employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset
or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents (&sect;179.210(b)), stating why the current salary
offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The Director shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset
or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Director shall notify the employee
in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the OPM salary offset coordinator shall
provide a new certification to the payroll office.

Installment deductions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment and, except
in rare circumstances, not to exceed 3 years. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable
relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The amount deducted for any period will not exceed
15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction
of a greater amount.

Lump-sum deductions from final check.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A lump-sum deduction exceeding the 15 percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lump-sum deductions from other sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When an employee subject to salary offset is separated from OPM and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset
of the final salary check, the Office, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the FCCS and OPM's implementing regulations, may
offset the balance of the debt against any financial payment due the employee from the U.S. Government.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple debts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single
creditor agency, OPM payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously
within the 15 percent limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Precedence of debts owed to OPM. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For OPM employees, debts owed to the Office generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. In the event
that a debt to the Office is certified while an employee is subject to a salary offset to repay another agency, the OPM
payroll office may decide whether to have that debt repaid in full before collecting its claim or whether changes should
be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed the Office can be collected in one pay period,
the payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the office
debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When an employee owes two or more debts, the best interests of the Government shall be the primary consideration
in determining the order of debt collection. The OPM payroll office, in making this determination, will be guided
primarily by the statute of limitations that affects the collection of the debt(s).

 Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Office must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Certify, in writing, to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date
on which payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the Office's
regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment and
the number and commencing date of the installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay period
is required);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) and action(s) was
taken (unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt
of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Submit a debt claim certification containing the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Submit the debt claim, as provided in &sect;179.208, to the employee's paying agency for collection if the employee
is in the process of separating, and has not received a final salary check, or other final payment(s) from the paying
agency. The paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and send a copy of the certification
to the employee and another copy to the creditor agency. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the
debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability
Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal Government sources, the paying
agency will provide written notification of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making such other
payments to the debtor employee. The written notification shall state that the employee owes a debt (including the
amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. The Office must submit a properly certified
claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, with modifications, the provisions of an

by broadening the scope of creditable advertising and promotion activities available to handlers and expanding
the Board's ability to engage in a significant generic advertising and promotion program to benefit the entire industry.
This action provides for more effective and efficient use of industry advertising and promotion funds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 981 [7 CFR Part 981], both as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order'' regulating the handling of almonds grown in California. The order is effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as
the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary will rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of
the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately
7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the almond handlers and producers may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action finalizes an interim final rule which revised &sect;981.441 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations
and is based on recommendations of the Board, comments received in response to the interim final rule, comments received
in response to the reopening of the comment period of the interim final rule, and other available information. The
interim final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 43500], on August 17, 1993. The rule amended &sect;981.441 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order.
It provided a 30 day comment period which ended September 16, 1993. During this period, one comment was received from
Cal-Almond, Inc., an independent almond handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 22, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California issued a ruling on a district
court order involving an action against the Department by three independent almond handlers wherein such handlers
alleged, among other things, that the Board's advertising program during the 1980's was unconstitutional because
the program violated the handlers' First Amendment Rights. The district court had ruled that the advertising program
was constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged the substantial public interest in designing
effective advertising and promotion programs to stimulate demand and to increase returns to growers but concluded
that the almond program in place during the 1980's was sufficiently flawed in that it did not meet the constitutional
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the potential effect of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's decision on the newly established Credit-Back
advertising and promotion program and on the almond industry as a whole, the Department determined that it was in the
public interest to reopen the comment period for the interim final rule. Accordingly, the comment period was reopened
on January 31, 1994, [59 FR 4247]. Reopening of the comment period provided interested persons an opportunity to review
the rules for the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program and to submit additional written opinions and
information regarding the potential effect of the Court's decision on that program. The Department also sought comments
on how to best address the issues raised in the Court's decision. The second comment period closed on March 2, 1994.
Seven additional comments were received. All of the comments received on the interim final rule will be discussed
herein.

Statutory and Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Almond Marketing Order is promulgated pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (``Act'').
Congress enacted this statute in 1937, a time of economic upheaval for many farmers, in order to stabilize market conditions
and ameliorate shortages and surpluses. Congress believed that ``establish[ing] and maintain[ing]'' such orderly
marketing conditions would be in the public interest, ultimately benefitting both farmers and consumers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 7 U.S.C. 602 (declarations of policy). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal means by which Congress sought to effectuate these goals is the promulgation of marketing orders under
7 U.S.C. &sect;608c. Marketing orders are regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, after notice and hearing,
and after a finding by the Secretary that the order's terms ``will tend to effectuate the declared policy of [the Act].''

Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the Secretary has promulgated a marketing order regulating the handlers of almonds
grown in California. The Order is administered by the Almond Board of California (``Board''), which is composed of
industry representatives, whose function it is to administer the Order and to recommend amendments to the Order.
The duties of the Board also include acting as intermediary between the Secretary and industry members; investigating
and collecting data on growing, shipping, and marketing conditions with respect to almonds; furnishing pertinent
information to the Secretary; and keeping record of its acts and transactions. Funds to cover the Board's expenses
are generated by levying assessments on each handler, in proportion to the kernel weight of almonds received.

Background of the California Almond Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Almond Marketing Order has been in effect since 1950. It provides a means for growers and handlers to
work together to address various problems which affect the marketing of California almonds, including varying weather
conditions which can lead to annual swings in production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One way in which the Almond Marketing Order has helped to address problems affecting the industry is by establishing
salable and reserve percentages for all almonds received by handlers during a given crop year. The establishment
of reserve percentages has allowed the Department to regulate the supply of almonds marketed and avoid dramatic price
drops during years of excess production. In years when the anticipated annual crop is large, a reserve percentage
may be established and handlers withhold a percentage of the almonds received from growers from the market. Conversely,
in years when the annual crop proves to be small, reserve almonds are released for sale. In addition, small quantities
of reserve almonds are sometimes used to develop new products or are disposed of in secondary markets such as oil or
livestock feed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has analyzed the production and sale of almonds since the inception of the Almond Marketing Order.
Over the past forty years, the production and sale of almonds, both in this country and abroad, have increased dramatically.
In the 1950's, almond production grew from 19 million to 84 million pounds per year and the value increased from $15
to $38 million. By 1969, production had reached 132 million pounds per year at a value of $74 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1950's and 1960's, the domestic market was the primary outlet for California almonds. Supplies which exceeded
the needs of the domestic market were exported or put to other ``non-competitive'' uses, such as sliced, diced and
slivered almonds. In 1969, shipments of almonds to export markets exceeded domestic shipments for the first time.
Most export shipments were of reserve almonds which were sold at prices below domestic levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Almond Marketing Order was amended in 1971 to provide for further market development through the establishment
of a creditable advertising and generic promotion program. These programs have been in effect since 1972. In recommending
that the Almond Marketing Order be amended to authorize advertising and promotion programs, proponents within the
almond industry believed that advertising almonds would tend to increase almond consumption and enhance grower
returns. The Department's analysis of sales figures for almonds during the last twenty-two years demonstrate that
this belief was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adoption of the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs has fostered a period of steady growth
in the demand for almonds, both domestically and abroad. From 1972 to 1992, domestic shipments of almonds increased
from 75 million pounds to 186 million pounds and their value increased from $63 million in 1972 to $318 million in 1992.
During these years, the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs fostered an even greater rate of growth
in the export market. Annual exports of almonds went from 69 million pounds in 1972 to 350 million pounds in 1992 and
the value increased from $58 million to $598 million. The industry has benefitted from increased production and sales
as consumption grew and almonds expanded into new markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the majority of almonds produced in the United States are sold abroad, with the largest markets in Germany
and Japan. The California almond industry has become an established supplier of high quality almonds to markets throughout
the world and has maintained a dominant share (over 60%) of the overall world almond market for the past ten years. Substantial
growth has also occurred in the demand for sliced, diced and slivered almonds, once considered a secondary almond
market. Due to market expansion, shipments of almonds for such uses are now considered normal commercial sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relative proportion of annual crop sold to ingredient manufacturers in bulk quantities has also increased substantially
during the last two decades. Currently, the majority of almonds sold in the United States are sold for use as ingredients
in candy, cereal, ice cream, baked goods, cookies, granola bars, prepared meals, and other manufactured products.
The Department's data on almond sales to export markets also indicates that the vast majority of almonds sold to European
countries are intended for use as ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the adoption of the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs there has been an increase in the
number of almond handlers operating in the United States. In 1971, there were 15 almond handlers in California and
the four largest handled about 95% of the annual crop. By 1991, there were 115 almond handlers in California and the
four largest handled 62% of the annual crop. The growth of the almond market has enabled small handlers to enter the
industry in greater numbers.

The Former Creditable Advertising Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time of its adoption in 1971, the almond Marketing Order's advertising and promotion program was structured
with a strong emphasis on individual handler advertising and promotion, with a complementary generic program conducted
by the Board. Since its implementation, the Secretary has instituted numerous rulemaking actions to revise and update
the creditable advertising and promotion program to address changing circumstances in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In revising the program, the Secretary relied, in part, on industry production and sales data and the Board's consistent
belief that the industry's advertising and promotion program provided an effective means of increasing almond sales.
The Board, on behalf of the industry, responds to changing industry practices and trends by recommending to the Secretary
modifications to the Order's implementing regulations and by redesigning its activities to better reflect these
changes, thereby ensuring further development of the almond industry. In addition, the Secretary also relied on
comments received from almond industry representatives and other interested persons prior to adopting certain
amendments to the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 981.41 of the Order provides the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, authority to credit a handler's
direct expenditures for marketing promotion, including paid advertising, against the applicable portion of their
assessment obligation. The requirements that a handler needed to fulfill before obtaining credit for promotion
are set forth in &sect;981.441 of the Administrative Rules and Regulations. The purpose of these requirements was
to ensure that creditable activities undertaken by handlers were forms of promotion recognized and accepted by advertising
and promotion industry norms, and could reasonably be expected to increase almond consumption. In addition, the
requirements were devised to ensure that creditable activities could be documented and costs could be measured in
conformance with industry standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the time of the program's inception, the list of handler activities for which credit could be obtained has frequently
been revised and expanded in order to meet the changing needs of the industry. In all, over twenty-five Board recommendations
have been made and adopted by the Secretary in an effort to improve the Order's advertising and promotion program.
Some examples of these revisions are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 16, 1982, [47 FR 40783], the creditable advertising and promotion program was revised in order to allow
handlers to receive credit against their creditable assessment obligations for distributing sample packages of
almonds to charitable and educational institutions (up to 150% credit allowed depending on volume), and for purchasing
almond promotional materials from the Board (100% credit allowed). The Board believed that these revisions would
provide handlers with additional opportunities to obtain credit for their promotion of almonds, especially for
handlers who did not market almonds under a specific brand name. These revisions were also intended to be advantageous
to small handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 23, 1987, [52 FR 13427], the program was revised to expand provisions already in place concerning the crediting
of certain handler marketing promotion expenditures related to mail order promotions. Specifically, the costs
of purchasing mailing lists to conduct mail order promotions and the costs of postage and envelopes to mail printed
promotional materials became creditable at a rate of up to $25,000 per crop year. The revision was intended to give
all handlers a new opportunity to take advantage of crediting. In 1990, [55 FR 41826] the creditable amount was further
relaxed to allow handlers to obtain credit for mail order promotions at a rate of up to $25,000 per crop year or 25 percent
of their creditable assessment obligations, whichever was greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 13, 1987, [52 FR 37926], the program was revised to increase the amount of credit that handlers could obtain
for media advertising in certain foreign markets. The revision was made because the export market for California
almonds was steadily increasing and the need for advertising in foreign countries was increasing accordingly. Under
this revised rule, handlers became eligible to receive a 100% credit for all qualified brand advertising media expenditures
conducted in designated foreign markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1989, [54 FR 6866], the program was again revised to allow handlers credit against their creditable
assessment obligations for payments for in-store supermarket generic or brand advertising using fixed position
(i.e. stationary) display advertisements, or video media. In addition, the provisions were further expanded to
allow handlers to receive a 150% credit for payments to the Board for the Board's generic advertising and promotion
program. These changes gave handlers additional flexibility in meeting their assessment obligations and particularly
benefited small handlers which did not have brand names and/or did not market their almonds in retail outlets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 16, 1990, [55 FR 41826], the program was further revised to provide handlers with additional opportunities
to receive credit against their creditable assessment obligations for their own branded or generic advertising
and promotional activities by (1) allowing credit for in-store supermarket advertisements using light emitting
diode (LED) signs (a new form of in-store supermarket advertising which was being offered by advertising firms at
that time); (2) expanding the provisions under which handlers could receive credit for in-store supermarket advertisements
using fixed position media; (3) allowing handlers credit for brand advertisements in all foreign countries where
California almonds were sold; and (4) increasing credit for certain mail order promotion costs. These revisions
were intended to better reflect current industry practices as they related to advertising and promotion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, other revisions to the program have been adopted in order to expand activities eligible for credit,
improve program administration and generally bring the program into line with industry practices. These numerous
revisions to the program demonstrate the Board's, as well as the industry's, recognition of changing conditions
within the market and their willingness and ability to adapt the almond advertising and promotional program to address
these changes.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reviewed the Almond Marketing Order's former creditable advertising
and promotion program in

 U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The case was brought by three independent almond handlers, each of which challenged the constitutionality of the
Almond Marketing Order's former creditable advertising program on the grounds that the mandatory nature of the program
violated their First Amendment rights. The Department's Judicial Officer upheld the validity of the Order. The handlers
sought review in the United States District Court, which affirmed the Secretary's decision. The handlers then appealed
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the District Court's decision, the Court of Appeals held that the former advertising and promotion program
imposed a burden on almond handlers' First Amendment rights, and, therefore, it was necessary to evaluate the nature
and scope of the burden imposed on those rights to determine whether the program was constitutional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ninth Circuit evaluated the constitutionality of the former almond advertising and promotion program under
a three-pronged test:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is the governmental interest in establishing and carrying out an advertising and promotion program substantial?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the program directly advance that interest?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the program no more extensive than necessary to achieve the government's purpose?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the almond program under this test, the Court held that there was in fact a substantial governmental
interest in establishing a program that would stimulate the demand for almonds and help maintain and expand markets
so as to enhance returns to almond growers. The Court went on to find, however, that there was insufficient record evidence
to establish that the former almond advertising and promotion program was effective enough to directly advance the
government's interest in increasing almond sales, and that the rules providing for credit against a handler's assessment
obligation for its own advertising were more extensive and cumbersome than necessary. Thus, it held that the advertising
regulations were an unconstitutional restriction on the handlers' First Amendment rights.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Ninth Circuit did not find inherent constitutional harm in the establishment of research and promotion programs
designed to increase sales and enhance grower returns. In fact, the Court acknowledged the substantial governmental
interest in establishing such programs in order to maintain and expand the markets for agricultural commodities.
The Court's complaint lay with the unique design of the former almond advertising and promotion program, with the
lack of record proof that it directly advanced the stated interests, and with the fact that the former creditable advertising
requirements seemed more extensive than necessary to achieve the approved goals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 17, 1993, [57 FR 43500] represents the most recent and extensive revision to the Order's advertising and
promotion program. Due to changes in the size and structure of the California almond industry during the 1980's and
1990's, as well as the fact that more handlers were beginning to sell almonds for use as ingredients in manufactured
products rather than for direct consumption, there was a general perception within the industry that a new and innovative
program needed to be implemented which would be even more effective than the former program in promoting the sale of
California almonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This prompted the Board and its Public Relations and Advertising Committee to seek to create a new and widely accepted
advertising and promotion program designed to aid the further development of the almond industry. On April 20, 1993,
by a vote of 9&hyph;1, the Board recommended the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program. The sole Board
member opposing the new program was generally opposed to the entire concept of creditable advertising and promotion.
This Board member asserted that all handlers should be required to fund a generic promotion program equally and that
any brand advertising done on their own should be carried out at their own expense without any type of Board oversight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program recognizes new marketing techniques which have been developed
by the industry over the years, and is intended to work with and complement a strong generic advertising and promotion
program which will be undertaken by the Board. The premise of the new program is that individual handlers will be most
effective in promoting their own portion of the almond crop while the Board will be the most effective vehicle through
which to enhance total demand for almonds through a generic advertising and promotion program. Some of the significant
features of the new program are as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new program, as modified in this final rule, handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional
activities will receive credit against their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment
installment due if they conduct and document their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior
to assessment billings. If handlers do not conduct any advertising and promotional activities prior to assessment
billings, they will be required to submit their advertising and promotional assessment when billed. If handlers
conduct advertising and promotional activities after assessment billings and file appropriate documentation,
they will be eligible for a refund or Credit-Back. Handlers will be billed in four equal installments during the crop
year. Handlers are not obligated to take part in the new program. Each handler must make an individual decision whether
or not to participate in the new program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back program substantially expands the list of advertising and promotional activities which will
be eligible for credit under the regulations. The range of activities eligible for credit cover virtually every sales
assistance, promotional, publicity and advertising area which a brand or individual company could use to aid in product
sales, with the exception of price reductions. In all, there are now fourteen advertising, promotion and public relations
categories of activities which will be eligible for credit. These include marketing research, paid media advertising
directed to end-users, trade or industrial users, in-store demonstrations, trade fairs, seminars and exhibits,
couponing, sponsorships, printing costs, trade and consumer product publicity, direct mailings, sales and marketing
presentation kits, and 50/50 advertising with retailers. Each of these activities are widely used and accepted forms
of marketing advertising and promotion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another aspect of the new program is the elimination of the 33% discount which was formerly allowed to handlers who
paid their assessments directly to the Board by a specified date. Under the former creditable advertising and promotion
program, handlers who paid their assessments to the Board by a specific date received a 150% credit against the advertising
and promotional portion of their assessments. These payments were then used by the Board for generic advertising
and promotion. In effect, this allowed handlers a 33% discount on a portion of their assessments. The purpose of the
discount at the time was to encourage smaller handlers which did not have individual advertising and promotional
programs to contribute to the Board's generic advertising and promotion program. Many members of the industry believed,
however, that handlers who received the benefit of the discount did not always pass it on to growers and thus achieved
a competitive advantage over handlers who engaged in individual advertising and promotional programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another feature of the new program is an appeals process whereby handlers have the option of anonymity in the event
a claim for a promotional activity is denied. Handlers may request that the Public Relations and Advertising Committee
review Board staff decisions concerning denied claims. If not satisfied with that committee's decision, handlers
may request that the Board review the issue. Handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before
the Board. Finally, handlers may request that the Department review the Board's decisions. The Department may review
all decisions at any point during the appeals process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back program also offers handlers more flexibility in getting credit against their assessments for
their own advertising and promotional activities compared with the former creditable advertising and promotion
program. Some examples of the ways in which the new Credit-Back program offers handlers more flexibility are as follows.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the former program, handlers were denied credit for individual advertisements if those advertisements directed
consumers to a specific retail store. Under the new program, this type of activity will be covered under the 14 broad
categories for which credit will be allowed. Thus, the new program eliminates previous restrictions on handlers
and will allow them greater flexibility in the promotion of their own products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, under the former program credit was denied for advertisements which also promoted competing nuts. Under the
new program, advertisements which contain references to almonds as well as competing nuts will be eligible for reimbursement.
Any reimbursement will, however, be limited to that percentage of the advertisement's cost which is equal to the percentage
of the advertisement which is devoted to almonds or the percentage of the product's weight which is almonds. The Board
believes that the percentage rule is logical and fair because the handler credit originates from assessments on almonds,
not on other products. The Board believes that to allow more credit than provided in the percentage rule would not serve
the best interests of the industry because handlers would receive credit for promoting products which have nothing
to do with the almond industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, handlers were not allowed credit for advertisements which promoted complementary branded products.
Under the new program, credit will be allowed for advertisements that promote both almonds and complementary branded
products. For the reasons described above, however, the amount of the reimbursement will be directly related to the
percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to the promotion of almonds. This will allow the almond industry
to operate under a system which is as unrestricted as possible without sacrificing the objectives of the Almond Marketing
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under the old program, credit was denied for advertisements which promoted products which were less than
50% almonds. Under the new program, credit will be granted for all advertisements of products which contain almonds,
regardless of the amount of almonds which are actually in the product. Again, the amount of the reimbursement will
be directly related to the percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to the promotion of almonds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recommending the new Credit-Back program, the Board concluded that because of the fundamental changes which have
occurred in the almond industry in recent years, it has become more difficult for individual handlers to directly
reach end consumers through their own advertising and promotion. Therefore, the importance of a collective industry
effort to generically promote the overall use of almonds has grown. For these reasons, the Board elected to strengthen
its generic promotion program while at the same time providing increased opportunities and incentives for handlers
who wished to continue to advertise their own brand products in order to receive Credit-Back against their assessments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the implementation of the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program will directly
advance the industry's collective goal of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. In addition, the
new program encourages and empowers handlers to protect their own interests by promoting their own brand of products
in order to get Credit-Back. The new program also recognizes that the collective interests of the industry are better
served if brand advertising and promotion is combined with the generic advertising and promotion of almonds. Both
generic and brand advertising and promotion are proven promotional tools which have fostered the growth of the almond
market over the last twenty years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new advertising and promotion program has been carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient
administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing
grower returns. Virtually all aspects of the former creditable advertising and promotion program have been modified
or eliminated so as to increase efficiency while at the same time imposing a minimum of restrictions on handlers. The
Board, the elective body composed of industry representatives, has carefully considered all aspects of this program
and believes that its implementation will lead to even greater strides in the development of the almond market.

The new advertising and promotion program is intended to enable the almond industry to have an advertising and promotion
program which better reflects its current needs. The Board believes that there is widespread industry support for
the new program. Overall, the new Credit-Back program is expected to foster the worldwide demand for California almonds
through the provision of a more efficient and effective program which will encompass both generic and brand advertising
and promotion.

Discussion of the Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was previously stated, USDA provided two comment periods for the new Credit-Back program. The first comment period
ended on September 16, 1993. One comment was received during this period from Cal-Almond, Inc., an independent almond
handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment period ended on March 2, 1994. During this period, seven comments were received. Five comments
were from independent almond handlers. They were Wiggin Farms, Arbuckle, CA; Western Nut Company, Chico, CA; Waterford
Nut Company, Waterford, CA; Rotteveel Orchards, Dixon, CA; and Cal-Almond, Inc., Hughson, CA. A sixth comment was
received from the U.S. Small Business Administration, Washington, DC. The seventh comment was received from Mr.
Rodger Wasson, President and CEO of the Almond Board of California. All of the comments will be discussed below. Because
many of the comments by the independent almond handlers contained similar concerns, they have been combined where
appropriate and are addressed collectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its first comment submitted on September 14, 1993, Cal-Almond, Inc., stated that the issuance of an interim final
rule rather than a proposed rule to establish the new Credit-Back program was arbitrary and capricious. The commenter
asserted that the former creditable advertising and promotion program has been substantially altered by the interim
final rule and the burden on handlers has been drastically increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's position that the issuance of the interim final rule met each of the requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) which pertain to the promulgation of regulations. The Board requested that the new regulations
for the Credit-Back program be effective for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. The only way to accomplish this was through
the utilization of interim final rulemaking procedures, as authorized by the APA. Also, the Department was advised
by the Board that the action was widely supported by the industry. While there was one dissenting vote among the ten
Board members who voted on the establishment of the new program, that person was opposed to the imposition of any advertising
assessments on members of the industry. The dissenting Board member had no specific criticisms of the new Credit-Back
program. Finally, contrary to the commenter's assertion, the interim final rule represented a relaxation of the
then-existing regulations. Moreover, the new Credit-Back program, as modified in this final rule, is further relaxed.
The new program is carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive
than necessary to meet the desired industry goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. The new
program substantially increases the advertising and promotional activities for which handlers can receive credit
against their assessment obligations. At the same time, it decreases the number of reporting deadlines and recordkeeping
requirements imposed on handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond further asserted that the Department does not have the authority to regulate how handlers pay growers
and that the new Credit-Back program's elimination of the provision which allowed handlers to receive a 150% credit
against the promotional advertising portion of their assessments because of concerns about grower returns was therefore
arbitrary and capricious. The commenter contended that: (1) the Almond Marketing Order does not permit the Department
to insure that growers receive a certain amount of returns on their products, and (2) the Order does not permit the Department
to become involved in contracts which handlers have with their growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the commenter's assertions, the interim final rule establishing the new Credit-Back program does not
specify how handlers should pay almond growers, nor does it seek to regulate the returns which growers receive for
their almonds. It is, however, the Act's intent that marketing orders help growers and handlers to work together to
solve problems which affect their industry. Thus, industry practices which have a potentially negative effect on
growers should be considered when making recommendations on changes to marketing order regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond and another independent almond handler, Western Nut Company, also commented that the new Credit-Back
program requires handlers to make expenditures of $3 in order to get back $1, thus placing an incredible financial
burden on handlers. Cal-Almond stated that this, in turn, will reduce handlers' initial payments to growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, independent almond handler, John Rotteveel on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, indicated that he did not
believe that the 50% return for creditable activities was enough to warrant any investment in the program. Grant Ecker
on behalf of Waterford Nut Company, stated the new Credit-Back program places a larger economic burden on small handlers
than the old program did.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the new Credit-Back program's imposition of a 50 percent Credit-Back limit for promotional
activities in foreign markets. Cal-Almond stated that this is not an expansion of the previous rule, but is instead
a restriction because the former rule allowed 100% credit for qualified promotional activities in foreign markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former creditable advertising and promotion program allowed for variable levels of credit for different activities,
between 50 percent and 150 percent depending on the activity. The new Credit-Back program is designed to be more equitable
because the credit allowed for all activities is the same. The amount of credit granted for foreign advertising expenditures
is identical to the amount given for domestic advertising. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that having the same credit amount for each activity provides equity for all handlers' advertising
and promotional activities. No preference is given in the new Credit-Back program for one type of advertising and
promotional activity over another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The range of Credit-Back activities has been expanded so that handlers will be able to receive credit for 13 additional
categories of promotion and advertising. This expansion could offset any increased outlays which handlers must
make for brand promotion and advertising projects due to the reduced rate of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back program is designed to provide handlers with more flexibility in conducting their advertising
and promotional activities. The commenters seem to be suggesting that it would be more desirable for the new program
to have an increased credit amount than what is currently allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 16, 1994, the Board met and discussed possible revisions that could be made to the new Credit-Back program. It
was expressed at this meeting that the 50 percent Credit-Back amount may impose a greater financial burden on handlers
than was anticipated. The Board unanimously recommended that the Credit-Back amount be modified from 50 percent
to 662/3 percent ($1.00 for every $1.50 spent). It was determined that this amount would provide incentive for handlers
to maintain their individual advertising and promotional efforts and still allow adequate funds for the generic
portion of the new advertising and promotion program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the new Credit-Back program's expanded activities along with an increased credit amount
will provide handlers with more incentive to maintain and more flexibility to conduct their individual advertising
and promotional efforts. Therefore, we are modifying the new Credit-Back program in this final rule by increasing
the amount of credit allowed for approved promotional activities from 50 percent to 662/3 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cal-Almond also claimed that the requirement that handlers file an application with the Board to obtain pre-approval
of creditable activities means that handlers cannot change their advertising plan for the entire year. Cal-Almond
also objected to the requirement that handlers submit proof of at least one approved advertising activity by January
15 of each year. Sharon Wiggin, on behalf of Wiggin Farms, also stated that the form filing requirements and deadlines
contained in the interim final rule are difficult to meet. The Department has determined that these comments have
merit. The purpose of the requirement that handlers file an application with the Board to obtain pre-approval of creditable
activities under the new program was to ensure that handlers were aware that the activity was eligible for Credit-Back
prior to expending funds for the activity. In the past, the Board occasionally had to reject claims for activities
that did not qualify after the promotional activity had already been conducted by the handler. The pre-approval provision
was only intended to assist handlers by helping them avoid any unnecessary outlays of funds for activities that did
not qualify for credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This aspect of the new program was also discussed at the recent Board meeting. The Board unanimously recommended that
the pre-approval provision was not essential to the successful administration of the program. As previously explained,
this provision was only intended to assist handlers. Handlers will no longer be required to obtain pre-approval of
creditable activities from the Board under the new program as modified in this final rule. The Board will continue
to assist any handler in determining whether an advertising and promotional activity is eligible for Credit-Back
under the new program prior to the handler expending funds for the activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the provision which allows Credit-Back payments only for the portion of product weight
represented by almonds or the handler's actual payment, whichever is less. The commenter claims that this provision
works against those handlers who apply for Credit-Back for advertising of processed products that contain only a
small percentage of almonds. The new Credit-Back program is, however, intended to allow Credit-Back only for money
actually spent for advertising California almonds, not for advertising another product. As discussed previously,
the Board believes that the percentage rule is logical and fair because the handler's credit originates from assessments
on almonds, not on other products. Without the percentage rule, the best interests of the entire industry would not
be served because handlers would receive credit for promoting products which have nothing to do with the almond industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the provision which requires a handler's name, brand, or the words ``California almonds,''
to appear on the product's primary face label in order for the handler to be eligible for Credit-Back. The commenter
contended that, because nearly all almonds produced in the United States are grown in California, the requirement
that the word ``California'' be placed on the label is unnecessary and may limit marketing opportunities for some
handlers in their negotiations with product manufacturers. The intent, however, of the new advertising and promotion
program is to promote the sale and consumption of ``California'' almonds, not other ingredients in products or almonds
not grown in California. This provision will help ensure that advertising generated by the new Credit-Back program
is, indeed, for almonds grown in California. In addition, the provision is not limited to the word ``California''
being placed on the product's primary face label in order for the handler to be eligible for Credit-Back. Handlers
can also negotiate with product manufacturers for the appearance of the handler's name or brand on the primary face
label in order to be eligible for Credit-Back. Handlers have three alternatives under the new program, all of which
ensure the promotion of ``California'' almonds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond, Thomas L. Motta, on behalf of Western Nut Company, Grant Ecker, and Sharon Wiggin objected to handlers
being required to expend advertising and promotion funds up-front in order to be eligible for a Credit-Back refund
at a later date. Cal-Almond also stated that handlers should not have to wait until February 15 of the crop year to begin
receiving Credit-Back refunds and that they should not have to wait 30 days after submission of claims to receive a
refund. The Department has determined that these comments have merit. Because payment practices have been changed
under the new Credit-Back program, the up-front payment may not provide some handlers with enough flexibility early
in the crop year to conduct their advertising and promotional activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This aspect of the new program was also discussed at the recent Board meeting. The Board unanimously recommended that
handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional activities may now receive credit against their Credit-Back
assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document their advertising
and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that in order to allow handlers more flexibility early in the crop year to conduct their
advertising and promotional activities, this final rule will be modified to allow handlers to receive credit against
their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document
their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the appeal process for determining whether a handler should receive Credit-Back for
a particular promotional activity. The commenter claimed that competitors of some handlers will determine the outcome
of their appeals. As previously discussed, handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before
the Board. In addition, the process allows for further appeal to the Department. The Department also has the right
to review all decisions at any point during the appeal process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the second comment period, Cal-Almond, as well as another independent almond handler, Rotteveel Orchards,
commented that under the new Credit-Back program there are many types of promotional and advertising activities
which handlers use to promote their products which will be ineligible for Credit-Back. John Rotteveel, on behalf
of Rotteveel Orchards, stated the best forms of advertising for his company_``word-of-mouth'' advertising and
personal contact with potential buyers_are not creditable activities under the new Credit-Back program. In addition,
Rotteveel indicated that he did not believe that the 50% return for creditable activities was enough to warrant any
investment in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As has already been pointed out, the range of promotional activities eligible for reimbursement under the new Credit-Back
program have been significantly expanded. The Department has also modified the new Credit-Back program in this final
rule by increasing the amount of credit allowed for approved promotional activities from 50 percent to 662/3 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the Board's television advertisements because it believes that they have a religious
connotation which should not be used to promote almonds. The advertising campaign referred to is not intended to be
offensive toward any religion, nor does it contain any negative connotations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the portion of the provision which requires individual handlers to determine and declare,
within 15 days after the start of the season, the extent to which they intend to use the advertising program. According
to the commenter, a handler should not be required to report a year in advance how he/she intends to advertise over an
entire year's period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this provision, in part, was to help the Board plan its finances for the upcoming crop year. With this information
available, the Board could determine who was participating and who was not participating in the new program for that
year. They would know at that time that all handlers who did not declare their intent would be paying the entire assessment
to the Board and that amount could be earmarked for the generic advertising and promotion program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision did not require handlers to give a dollar amount or an advertising plan to the Board, but merely an anticipated
percentage of their entire advertising assessment they believed would be used under the new program. The deadline
was not intended to limit a handler's use of the program. Handlers were not restricted to any types of advertising or
any specific amounts. However, the total Credit-Back amount could not exceed the original percentage reported to
the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Cal-Almond's interpretation of this provision is not accurate, the Department considered all aspects
of this provision to determine if there were other ways that the Board could obtain this information without requiring
handlers to declare their intent to utilize the program. The new Credit-Back program is intended to provide handlers
with more flexibility to conduct their own advertising and promotional activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the Board has other alternatives to accomplish the objectives discussed above, such
as reviewing handler participation during past years to obtain an estimate of participation in the new Credit-Back
program for the new crop year. The Department has determined that in order to allow handlers more flexibility to participate
in the new Credit-Back program, this provision should be eliminated from the regulations. Accordingly, this final
rule will be revised to reflect that change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the second comment period, another independent handler, Wiggin Farms, stated that a referendum should be
conducted every three years to offer growers an opportunity to vote on increasing or decreasing advertising expenditures
and for voting on continuation of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the Board currently has the authority to recommend annual changes in program expenditures.
Determining the merits of holding periodic continuance referenda is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The referenda
issue was addressed last year when the Board and other industry groups recommended, during a formal rulemaking hearing
in Modesto, California, that periodic referenda be held. The Department is in the process of reviewing and evaluating
the record of the formal rulemaking proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many comments, as requested, addressed the Ninth Circuit decision. These comments are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond stated that all of the rules and regulations contained in the interim final rule deprive handlers of their
First Amendment rights and suggested that the entire creditable program be eliminated. The commenter asserted that
a determination has never been made by the Board as to whether the Order or individual handlers are better at promoting
and advertising almonds. The commenter further stated that there have never been any studies conducted to indicate
whether the current advertising program is effective and contended that the Department is unable to show that the
regulations are required in order to advance the stated goal of selling more almonds and increasing returns to producers.
In addition, the commenter contended that the regulations contained in the interim final rule are more extensive
than necessary to serve the governmental interest of increasing almond sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One independent almond handler, Thomas Motta on behalf of Western Nut, stated that if the Marketing Order's advertising
program is deemed constitutional at some future date, the Secretary should evaluate what type of advertising program
best serves the almond industry. Motta further stated that the Ninth Circuit ruled that compelled advertising violates
a handler's First Amendment rights and that regardless of what the Board calls it, it is still forced collection. Motta
suggested that the advertising provisions of the order be put on hold until they are proven to be beneficial to the industry
and are determined to be legal by the appropriate Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another independent almond handler, Grant Ecker on behalf of Waterford Nut Company, stated that he agrees with the
Ninth Circuit Court ruling that the regulations hinder handler's efforts to increase sales and returns to growers.
He stated that the new Credit-Back program places a larger economic burden on small handlers than the old program did.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
John Rotteveel, on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, stated that the current and former advertising programs violate
his constitutional rights. He believes that the program is a waste of money and does nothing to increase the consumption
of almonds that almond handlers could not do themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Rotteveel stated that there is no way to prove that the advertising programs have increased world demand
for almonds. He believes that growers and handlers are expanding these markets without the help of the Order and does
not think that the increase in the number of handlers and growers in the United States can be attributed to the Order.
Rotteveel suggested phasing out the Order and letting the almond industry run itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's position that the former creditable advertising program and the new Credit-Back program meet
each of the criteria set forth in the Ninth Circuit decision which pertain to constitutionality. The Department believes
that both programs are authorized under the Act and that the regulations do not infringe upon the First Amendment rights
of any handler. Importantly, the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cal-Almond 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
did not hold that all advertising and promotion programs are unconstitutional or illegal on their face. Rather, the
court recognized the substantial government interest in promoting almond consumption in order to stimulate the
demand for almonds and enhance grower returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program has been carefully structured so
that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired
goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. Virtually all aspects of the former creditable advertising
and promotion program have been modified or eliminated so as to increase efficiency while at the same time imposing
a minimum of restrictions on handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional comment in the form of an exception to another comment was received from Cal-Almond well after the second
comment period closed. Because Cal-Almond's comment was received after the close of the comment period, it has not
been considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment was received from the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration
(SBA). The SBA contended that the Secretary did not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) in issuing the
interim final rule. It recommended that the Department perform a regulatory flexibility analysis, which would study
the impact of advertising programs on small handlers and would consider alternatives to the program. The SBA further
stated that the Secretary's assertion about small entity orientation and compatibility did not meet the requirements
of the RFA. The SBA stated that the RFA does not provide exceptions for statutes that are not compatible with its goals.
The SBA commented further that: (1) most small handlers sell to ``food processors'' and have no reason to promote fresh
consumption of almonds, and (2) advertising expenses designed to increase use by ingredient manufacturers were
not creditable under the old program and are not creditable under the new program. Finally, the SBA stated that the
Credit-Back program was promulgated with no evidence that it would advance the government's interest, or that it
is the least restrictive program needed to enhance almond sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the SBA indicated that the Secretary should consider alternatives to the current advertising
program, including no program at all, or, at a minimum, a program that imposes less restrictions on handlers. The SBA
also recommended that promotional efforts targeting ingredient manufacturers should be given the same credit as
those targeting fresh consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advertisements resulting from joint participation by a handler and manufacturers or sellers of two complementary
products or commodities were eligible for credit under the former advertising and promotion program provided that
the brand name was used.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the new Credit-Back program, advertising and promotion activities to trade, industrial or end users are specifically
eligible for Credit-Back, with no requirement for a brand name. In addition, the Board's generic program contains
consumer advertising designed to communicate the message that almonds enhance any product to which they are added.
Research has found such consumer advertising is successful in promoting consumption of products used as ingredients.
Increased consumption of almonds benefits the entire industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department disagrees with the SBA's assertion that this action fails to meet the requirements for the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. The SBA's concerns regarding the program's impact on small businesses have been properly addressed
in this document and the interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a comment was received from Rodger Wasson, CEO of the Almond Board, which supported the new Credit-Back program
and supplied documentation to substantiate the Board's position. Mr. Wasson discussed the history of the almond
industry and beneficial changes that have taken place since the implementation of the creditable advertising program.
He stated that the program has provided a variety of services designed to increase the demand for California almonds.
In addition, it has continually been revised to meet the needs of the industry. Mr. Wasson stated that the Credit-Back
provisions were recommended in order to more fully address the needs of the changing industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He stated there are major differences between the previous creditable advertising program and the new Credit-Back
program. Some examples are as follows: (1) The previous program allowed handler credit for paid media 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertisements only. There were separate systems for ``generic packs'' and ``150 percent credit''. The new Credit-Back
program adds 13 advertising, promotion and public relations categories (only travel is excluded across-the-board);
(2) The previous program contained many reporting periods, carryovers, and recordkeeping on different systems.
Credit-Back is simplified with one system, no carryovers, and a basic report-as-you-go reporting system; (3) The
previous program did not allow credit for almonds used as an ingredient if the product contained less than 50 percent
of almonds by weight. Credit-Back allows credit for the weight represented by almonds as an ingredient; (4) The previous
program did not allow credit for advertisements directing consumers to one or more named retail outlets, other than
handler-operated outlets. Credit-Back allows such advertisements if they include mention of almonds; (5) The previous
program did not allow credit for advertisements promoting ``competing nuts.'' Credit-Back allows credit for this
activity determined by the portion of the product represented by almonds and/or product weight, and (6) The previous
program did not allow credit for advertisements that promote more than two complementary products. Credit-Back
allows credit up to the portion represented by almonds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Mr. Wasson submitted materials on the benefits of generic advertising. A summary of the materials is
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Generic Advertising and Promotion Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generic advertising, i.e., advertising activities which focus on the general properties of a product such as flavor,
nutritional benefits and convenience, rather than touting specific brand names, is a proven promotional tool which
is often used to increase demand for agricultural commodities. When used in conjunction with brand name promotion,
generic advertising has proven to be highly successful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, generic advertising of agricultural commodities has grown steadily since the first commodity
board was created more than 50 years ago. In 1990, about 350 generic promotion programs were in effect at the federal
and state levels, covering more than 80 commodities at a cost of over $530 million annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the federal programs referred to above are overseen by USDA. The Agricultural Marketing Service (``AMS'')
of the USDA currently oversees promotional programs contained in various federal marketing orders authorized under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (the AMAA). These marketing orders cover fruits, vegetables, specialty
crops and milk. In addition, AMS has oversight responsibility for numerous federal statutes which authorize research
and promotion programs for a variety of commodities, including beef, cotton, dairy, eggs, honey, limes, mushrooms,
pork, potatoes, soybeans, milk, and watermelons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The success of many of these advertising and promotion programs has been well documented. For instance, an advertising
campaign conducted by the Potato Board has yielded dramatic results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Potato Board was founded in 1972 at a time when potato consumption was steadily declining. Many people had poor
images of potatoes, did not know of their nutritional value and believed that they were fattening. In the years after
its formation, the Board initiated numerous advertising campaigns designed to improve the potato's poor reputation
and increase consumer sales. As a result, potato consumption has increased by 12% and 96% of the public is now aware
that potatoes are a high fiber, low fat food which can be included in any healthy diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board to promote milk and milk products have also met with success.
The Board was founded in 1984 and since then has spent more than $75 million annually on the promotion of dairy products.
As a result, dairy product consumption rose by 12% between 1983 and 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another example of a successful generic program is provided by the California Prune Board. In the 1980's, prunes were
not a popular fruit and most members of the public had little knowledge of their nutritional value, specifically,
their high fiber content. In 1987, the prune Board began a campaign to highlight the link between consumption of high
fiber foods (such as prunes, which were marketed as a good tasting, high fiber fruit) and cancer prevention. The program
included direct mailings of product samples to physicians, publicity and media appearances by experts about the
health benefits of prunes, and sampling programs in shopping malls and on domestic airline flights. Combined with
generic advertising and promotion, the program resulted in a 12% increase in prune sales in 1987 alone. To date, the
sales of California prunes continue to rise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The success of certain commodity programs has also been measured through technical economic studies on the effects
of generic advertising on industry sales. The results are impressive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, in a recent study of the Washington apple industry (Olan D. Forker and Ronald W. Ward, 1991) it was estimated
that between 1988 and 1991, the industry received a rate of return of $6.63 for every dollar of assessments spent on
the promotion of apples. In all, this represented a $133.76 million dollar return on a $17.5 million investment and
the market price which Washington apple growers received for their apples between 1988 and 1991 was estimated to be
12.9% higher than it would have been without generic advertising. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a recent study sponsored by the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board (Ronald W. Ward, 1993) examined
the effects of generic advertising on the beef industry. Based on extensive economic analysis, it was estimated that
between 1987 and 1992, the beef industry realized an average return rate of $5.80 for every dollar spent on promotional
activities. By February 1992, the total economic return to the industry was estimated at $2.99 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study by Ronald Ward and Bruce Dixon in 1989 provides an economic analysis of the effects of generic advertising on
fluid milk consumption. The authors of this study found that such promotion, authorized under the National Dairy
and Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983, ``confirm[s] a statistically significant relationship between fluid milk consumption
and generic fluid milk advertising *&blank;*&blank;*'' Other research conducted by O.D. Forker and H.M. Kaiser
of Cornell University indicates that between 1984 and 1990, dairy farmers realized a farm level return rate of 4.6
to 1 on investments in generic advertising authorized under the National Dairy Promotion Program.

Mr. Wasson also submitted materials on the benefits of branded advertising. A summary of the materials is as follows.

Branded Advertising
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The usefulness of branded advertising to increase the sales of a particular product is also well documented. Within
the private sector, companies unfailingly recognize the importance of advertising and collectively spend billions
of dollars a year on advertising and promotion activities in order to generate sales. In 1992 alone, the nation's top
20 advertisers spent more than $500 million on advertising. (Advertising Age, August 29, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the agricultural field, brand advertising is also a useful tool which has been found to benefit not only the
actual brand advertiser, but the overall industry as well. Through brand advertising, handlers seek to move their
own products from the shelf to the consumer. A recent study conducted by an economist at the University of California
at Davis, Department of Agricultural Economics (Jason Christian, 1994) concluded that brand advertising has afforded
substantial benefits to all California almond growers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In his analysis, Christian examined the market effects of brand advertising by one large almond cooperative as well
as other independent handlers, between 1972 and 1992. Based on Christian's analysis, it was estimated that the average
rate of return to the industry as a result of brand advertising by the cooperative was substantial. During the 1980's
the average rate of return for each additional dollar spent on advertising expenditures was about $5.00. Aside from
the individual brand advertiser, other handlers in the industry also benefited from the advertising because it created
an increased demand for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 almonds. Between 1979 and 1990, the benefits received by other almond handlers actually exceeded the returns received
by the brand advertiser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wasson also submitted materials on the effects of almond promotion on the industry, including documentation
on imports and exports of almonds and statistical tables on the almond industry. A summary of the materials is as follows.

Effects of Almond Promotion on the Almond Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aside from the studies described above, there are numerous other indications that the combined creditable and generic
advertising program administered by the Almond Board has been highly successful. Statistics indicate that both
the supply and demand of California almonds have increased significantly since the inception of the Almond Marketing
Order's advertising and promotion program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the early 1980's the U.S. almond crop averaged about 300 million pounds. By the early 1990's the almond crop averaged
about 550 million pounds. Almonds have thus attained a level of market growth which few other agricultural commodities
can claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significantly, grower prices for almonds have remained relatively stable throughout these years of increased production.
One basic theory of economic analysis is that prices for a product will fall if supply increases without a corresponding
increase in demand. The relative stability of prices within the almond industry throughout the years of increased
production indicate that demand for California almonds has increased dramatically over the years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another measure of the growing popularity of almonds can be obtained through analysis of per capita consumption.
USDA figures indicate that the United States' per capita consumption of almonds is well ahead of that of any competing
nuts. In 1970&hyph;71, the average American's per capita consumption of almonds was about .34 pounds per person.
In 1987&hyph;88, the average per capita consumption of almonds was .58 pounds per person. By 1991&hyph;92, per capita
consumption had risen to .82 pounds per person. This represents a 40% increase in per capita consumption between 1987
and 1992. Importantly, no tree nut was promoted more aggressively than almonds during this period. Additionally,
the tree nut with the second largest per capita consumption between 1987 and 1992 was walnuts, at just .54 pounds per
person.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further evidence of the growth of the almond industry is provided by the fact that the use of almonds as ingredients
in new products continues to increase. In 1992, almonds were most often included in all new foods containing tree nuts
or peanuts which were introduced on the market. In all, 35% of all new products containing any type of nuts which were
introduced in 1992 contained almonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that economic studies of the almond industry also show that advertising is a good use of industry
funds. In his 1985 study of the relationship between advertising, risk and domestic sales of almonds, Dr. John Baritelle,
a research agricultural economist and a professor at the University of California-Riverside, concluded that advertising
has been a good investment for the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the basis for his study, Baritelle posed the initial question, ``What does the industry get for its advertising
dollar, and what would we get if we advertised even more?'' (Non-Technical Statement on Almond Advertising Model
and Domestic Sales, at p. 2) (July, 1985). Almond crops for the years 1981 through 1983 were analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study found that for the crop year 1981, when almond production was at an all time high of 408 million pounds and the
advertising budget was 10.86 million dollars, total estimated returns on advertising ranged from $1.21 to $4.51
for each dollar spent. This figure included the estimated returns that advertising dollars expended in 1981 would
yield in 1982 since the study found that advertising has an impact on per capita sales in the year of expenditure as well
as in the following year. Importantly, Baritelle found that even if the 1981 advertising budget had been increased
by 25% to $13.58 million, the industry would still have received a total return of at least $1.02 on every dollar spent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982, when almond production returned to more normal levels and the advertising budget was $8.85 million, total
estimated returns on advertising ranged from $1.75 to $6.26 for each dollar spent. Again, this figure included the
estimated returns that advertising dollars expended in 1982 would yield in 1983. Additionally, Baritelle noted
that even if the 1982 budget had been increased by 75% to $15.49 million, the return to the industry would have been at
least $1.04 for every dollar spent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department notes that in 1983, when almond production was low due to poor weather conditions and the advertising
budget was $6.10 million, estimated returns ranged from $2.34 to $8.37. Again, this figure took into account returns
that were expected to be realized in 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wasson went on to state that although investing in the advertisement of almonds is a proven way to increase sales,
it is significant that, when compared to other commodity boards, the Almond industry spends relatively little on
promotional activities. For instance, the Washington Apple and Almond industries have similar crop sizes_about
$1 billion_yet the Almond Board spends substantially less on advertising than the Washington Apple Commission.
The Almond Board's promotional budget for the year 1993&hyph;94 was $5.4 million. The Washington Apple Commissions'
advertising expenses for that same period was a little over $7.0 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also significant that the Almond Board's lengthy process of developing and implementing generic advertising
campaigns is consistent with advertising industry norms. Testing and monitoring is performed at various stages
in the development and airing of advertisements and follow-up research on their effectiveness is conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different concepts regarding the best method of promoting almonds are also explored. For example, focus group concept
testing was conducted prior to the 1993&hyph;94 advertising campaign, and a concept was chosen from four alternatives.
Advertisements were then developed, presented to a consumer audience for reaction, and adjustments and refinements
were made before a final product was developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After airing an advertisement, consumer awareness is measured since this is a basic measurement of an advertisement's
effectiveness. Results of these tests recently showed that the television advertisement approved for use by the
Almond Board during the 1993&hyph;94 campaign was very successful. In addition, based on the experience gained from
the 1993&hyph;94 campaign, the Board has conducted research to assist in developing a new program for 1994&hyph;95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order and its regulations were initiated by the industry for the benefit of the industry. Without majority industry
support, the Order, or any part of it, could have been suspended or terminated. Mr. Wasson concluded by stating that
the advertising and promotional programs instituted by the Board have received continual majority support since
their inception.

The Department's Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's experience has been that whenever a segment of any industry is ``required'' to do certain things
in order to make a program work for all, it is not unusual to find members of the industry who do not agree with any or all
aspects of the program. There are some who just do not want to participate in any advertising or promotion programs.
In order for a marketing order to be successful, however, participation by everyone is very important.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the decision of the Ninth Circuit, the Department's oversight responsibilities of the almond marketing order
were carefully analyzed and considered. It was determined that it is in the best interest of the majority of the almond
industry that the advertising and promotion program continue as modified herein.

(a) In order for a handler to receive credit for his/her own promotional activities from his/her pro rata portion of
advertising assessment payments, pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;981.41(c), the Board must determine that such expenditures meet the applicable requirements of this section.
Credit will be granted either in the form of a payment from the Board, or as an offset to the advertising assessment if
activities are conducted and documented to the satisfaction of the Board at least two weeks prior to assessment billings.
Credit, hereinafter termed ``Credit-Back'', will be granted in an amount not to exceed 662/3 percent of a handler's
proven expenditures for qualified activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The portion of the handler assessment for which credit may be received under this section will be billed, and is
due and payable, at the same time as the portion of the handler assessment used for the Board's administrative expenses,
unless the handler(s) conduct and document activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. In the latter
case, handlers' advertising assessment obligations will be reduced according to the amount of proven activities
approved by the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Board shall grant Credit-Back for qualifying activities only to the handler who performed such activities
and who filed a claim for Credit-Back in accordance with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Credit-Back shall be granted only for qualified promotional activities which are conducted and completed during
the crop year for which Credit-Back is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The following requirements shall apply to Credit-Back for all promotional activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Credit-Back granted by the Board shall be that which is appropriate when compared to accepted professional practices
and rates for the type of activity conducted. In the case of claims for Credit-Back activities not covered by specific
and established criteria, the Board shall grant the claim if it is consistent with practices and rates for similar
activities. To this end, the Board may issue guidelines for qualifying activities from time to time as warranted.
For activities in markets other than the United States and Canada, paragraph (e)(5) of this section shall also apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The clear and evident purpose of each activity shall be to promote the sale, consumption or use of California almonds,
and nothing therein shall detract from this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No Credit-Back will be given for advertising placed in publications that target the farming or grower trade. No
Credit-Back shall be given for any outdoor advertising or sponsorships in the California almond growing counties
of Butte, Colusa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Madera, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties,
except that, outdoor advertising in these counties which specifically directs consumers to a handler-operated
outlet offering direct purchase of almonds will be eligible for Credit-Back. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Credit-Back shall be granted for those qualified activities specified below, except that Credit-Back for travel
expenses will not be allowed in any case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Credit-Back for promotional activities in a foreign market shall be granted at 662/3 percent of a handler's unreimbursed
expenditures for qualified activities in any foreign market, if the handler is promoting pursuant to a contract with
the Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA (FAS) and/or the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Such
activities must also meet the requirements of paragraphs (e) (1), (2), (3), (4), and (6) of this section. Unless the
Board is administering the foreign marketing program, such activities shall not be eligible for Credit-Back unless
the handler certifies that he/she was not and will not be reimbursed by either FAS or the CDFA for the amount claimed
for Credit-Back, and has on record with the Board all claims for reimbursement made to FAS and/or the CDFA. Foreign
market expenses paid by third parties as part of a handler's contract with FAS or CDFA will not be eligible for Credit-Back.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A handler must file claims with the Board to obtain Credit-Back for promotional expenditures, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All claims submitted to the Board for any qualified activity must include:

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T (military
T&hyph;1A) airplanes, that requires an inspection of certain flap roller retention components to detect discrepant
or missing parts, and replacement of discrepant or missing parts; and installation of new washers on the roller attach
bolts. This amendment is prompted by reports of undersized tabs on some lock washers, and tabs or inner tangs missing
from the washers installed on the flap roller bolts. Such discrepancies defeat the locking function of the tab washer,
and could result in loss of the nut and flap roller. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the
main or aft flap surface and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11939). That action proposed to require an inspection of certain flap roller retention components
to detect discrepant or missing parts, and replacement of discrepant or missing parts with new or serviceable parts;
and installation of new washers, tab washers, and flat washers on the roller attach bolts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 122 Model Beech 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes of the affected design in the
worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 102 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take
approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55
per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,080, or $540 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes,
that requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual to require takeoff operation in accordance with revised performance
data. This amendment is prompted by a report of a change that had been incorporated into the propeller governor of these
airplanes during production, which altered the thrust decay characteristic of the propeller when operating in an
engine failure scenario. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that the airplane is operated at sufficient
speeds to mitigate the problems associated with a faster thrust decay and to prevent the airplane from departing the
side of the runway.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14124). That action proposed to require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to require takeoff
operation of the airplane in accordance with the revised performance data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 112 Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.
The FAA estimates that 18 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work
hour per airplane to accomplish the AFM change, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $55 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series
airplanes, that requires removal of the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer valve, and installation of a locking
device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve. This amendment is prompted by a report that the fuel-ballast transfer
valve on certain airplanes must be modified to ensure the valve is closed at all times. If the transfer valve is open
during flight, the fuel supply to the engines may be reduced during cross-feed operation to the extent that fuel starvation
could occur. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine flameout due to fuel starvation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14799). That action proposed to require removal of the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer
valve, and installation of a locking device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 5 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 0.5
work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $250 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $1,387.50, or $277.50 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D
series engines. This action requires initial and repetitive inspections of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly,
replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with a more leak-resistant configuration, and replacement
of aluminum oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings with steel fittings. This amendment is prompted by reports of
two engine fires initiated by fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly, ignition of that fuel,
melting of aluminum oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings that are in the proximity of the Number 7 nozzle, and augmentation
of that fire with the liberated oil. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage from the Number
7 fuel nozzle and support assembly, ignition of that leaking fuel, and liberation of oil from melted oil line fittings,
which can result in an uncontained engine fire and damage to the aircraft.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received two reports of uncontained engine fires on Pratt &amp; Whitney
(PW) JT8D series engines due to fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly, ignition of that fuel,
melting of aluminum oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings that are in the proximity of the Number 7 nozzle, and augmentation
of that fire with the liberated oil. The resulting fire burned through the engine diffuser case and fan ducts, causing
an aircraft engine cowl fire. The FAA has determined that the fuel nozzle and support assembly is susceptible to incomplete
or improper refurbishment or repair that could result in fuel leaks across the fuel nozzle seals, and that the aluminum
oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings have inadequate fire resistance capability. These oil line fittings are
in the path of the fuel leaking and associated fire from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly. Impingement
of the fire on these oil fittings causes them to melt, thus causing the oil contained in the oil tubes to escape and to
augment the fire. Therefore, this amendment will require the inspection of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly
for evidence of fuel leakage and burning until replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with a more
leak-resistant configuration. It also requires replacement of the aluminum oil tube fittings with steel fittings.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly,
ignition of that leaking fuel, and liberation of oil from melted oil line fittings, which can result in an uncontained
engine fire and damage to the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. A6153, Revision 1,
dated June 8, 1994, that describes procedures for initial and repetitive borescope inspections of the Number 7 fuel
nozzle and support assembly; and ASB No. A6169, Revision 1, dated June 15, 1994, and A6170, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 13, 1994, that describe procedures for replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with a more
leak-resistant configuration and replacement of the aluminum oil tube fittings with steel fittings, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other PW JT8D series engines of the
same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent uncontained engine fire and damage to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD requires inspection of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly for evidence of fuel leakage and burning
until replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with an improved sealing configuration. This AD
also requires replacement of the aluminum oil tube fittings with steel fittings. The actions are required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes, that requires a revision to the Flap Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit input wiring. This amendment is prompted by reports of disconnection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Landing Gear Module electrical connectors, which can result in the loss of the primary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary, and alternate control of the flaps. The actions specified by this AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent the possibility of an all-flaps-up landing due to the loss of control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all flap operations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes was published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Federal Register on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24671). That action proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a revision to the Flap Control Unit (FCU) input wiring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, Boeing, requests that the discussion of the addressed unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition that appeared in the preamble to the notice be clarified. In that preamble, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA stated that, if the landing gear module connectors become disconnected, all FCU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modes of flap operation (primary, secondary, and alternate control of flaps) could be lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter suggests that the discussion would have been more precise if it had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained information to indicate that the landing gear module includes the ALTN ARM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FLAPS switch and the ALTN FLAPS position selector used to control the leading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trailing edge flaps in the alternate mode. The FAA acknowledges this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter requests that the proposal be revised to cite the latest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346 as the source for modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346, dated May 19, 1994. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision contains a correction to a type of wire that had been called out in the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version of the service bulletin; this correction ensures that the wire and its associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solder sleeve are metalurgically compatible. In order to ensure that the correct wiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification assembly is installed on the affected airplanes, the FAA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised service bulletin should be cited as the appropriate source of service information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for complying with the requirements of this rule. The final rule has been revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. The FAA has confirmed that no U.S. operators have yet modified any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplane in accordance with the original service bulletin; therefore, by citing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised service bulletin, the final rule will impose no additional economic burden on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the compliance time be extended from the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days to 90 days, due to a possible parts availability problem. This commenter states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it does not normally stock the required parts and materials to accomplish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirements of the rule. This commenter has ordered these parts from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplier and is currently waiting to obtain them. Additionally, this commenter points out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the manufacturer's service bulletin, referenced in the proposal, recommends 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for modification. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. In developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not only the degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation as to an appropriate compliance time, the availability of required parts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. The FAA points out that the parts required for the wiring modification are readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available; therefore, obtaining them within the proposed compliance time should not pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a problem for any affected operator. Further, the FAA took into account the 60-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance time recommended by the manufacturer, as well as the number of days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for the rulemaking process; in consideration of these factors, the FAA finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days after the effective date of this final rule will fall approximately at the same time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance as recommended by the manufacturer. However, under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an acceptable level of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 300 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required parts will cost approximately $200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $25,500, or $750 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100
series airplanes. This action requires repetitive inspections of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the
rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. This
AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted by a report
of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a landing gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplane. The
actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear in the event of a low
voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes. Transport Canada advises
that it has received a report of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a landing gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7
series airplane. The cause of this leakage has been attributed to a faulty seal. Such leakage, if combined with a low
voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid, could result in inadvertent retraction of the landing gear.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the same selector valve that is used on Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes is installed on Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100
series airplanes, the FAA finds that the latter airplane model also is subject to the addressed unsafe condition.
The FAA may consider issuance of parallel rulemaking action to address this unsafe condition on Model DHC&hyph;7
series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;32&hyph;117, dated December 11, 1992, that describes
procedures for repetitive inspections of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic
fluid, and replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. Transport Canada Aviation classified
this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;05, dated March
16, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., also has developed a valve (Modification 8/0530) that incorporates several improvements to
minimize pilot valve leakage. This valve is equipped with an improved spring that keeps the valve firmly seated. The
improved valve incorporates a reduced rate of opening and further restricts the orifice leading to the landing gear
actuators. Replacement of certain valves with these improved valves will minimize the possibility of inadvertent
landing gear retraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear
in the event of a low voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid. This AD requires repetitive inspections
of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and replacement of certain valves
with serviceable valves, if necessary. This AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;76&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes. This action requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive inspections of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydraulic fluid, and replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment is prompted by a report of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplane. The actions specified in this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are intended to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear in the event of a low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes. Transport Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation advises that it has received a report of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplane. The cause of this leakage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been attributed to a faulty seal. Such leakage, if combined with a low voltage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition at the selector valve down solenoid, could result in inadvertent retraction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
De Havilland, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A7&hyph;32&hyph;97, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 10, 1992, that describes procedures for repetitive inspections of the hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. Transport Canada Aviation classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;04, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated March 16, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., also has developed a valve (Modification 7/2516) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporates several improvements to minimize pilot valve leakage. This valve is equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an improved spring that keeps the valve firmly seated. The improved valve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporates a reduced rate of opening and further restricts the orifice leading to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gear actuators. Replacement of certain valves with these improved valves will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the possibility of inadvertent landing gear retraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear in the event of a low voltage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition at the selector valve down solenoid. This AD requires repetitive inspections of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. This AD also provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is considering the issuance of parallel rulemaking action to address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same unsafe condition on Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes.

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;75&hyph;AD.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16
series airplanes, that requires inspection to detect chafing of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG),
modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This amendment is prompted by a report that the
wiring harness on certain airplanes was produced in a configuration that is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chafing and electrical shorting. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chafing or shorting of the wiring harness, which could result in loss of ADG power to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential bus when the ADG is deployed during an emergency situation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11735). That action proposed to require inspection to detect chafing and modification of the
wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work
hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modification and the
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350, or $694 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,725, or $749 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that
requires modification of the mounting structure of the elevator controls on the rear pressure bulkhead. This amendment
is prompted by the results of a structural analysis which indicate that certain structure in the elevator control
system may be subject to deformation when maximum load is exerted by the pilot(s) in the event of a jam in the elevator
control cables. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane
due to structural deformation in the elevator control system.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to all Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11947). That action proposed to require modification of the mounting structure of the elevator
control components on the rear pressure bulkhead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16.5
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $7,260, or $907.50 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA Form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents in unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedures before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of the Federal Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The large number of SIAPS, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of two supplemental
new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. One supplemental NADA provides for
use of fenbendazole granules, the other provides for use of a fenbendazole Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated
feed, both products for use as dewormers for zoo and wildlife animals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206, P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258, filed a supplement
to NADA 121&hyph;473 that provides for use of fenbendazole 22.2 percent granules to top dress feed, and a supplement
to NADA 131&hyph;675 that provides for use of a fenbendazole Type A medicated article (4 percent, 8 percent, and 20
percent) to make Type C medicated feed. The supplements provide for using 2.5 to 10 milligrams of fenbendazole per
kilogram of body weight per day for 3 days for removal and control of internal parasites in zoo and wildlife animals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Supplemental NADA 121&hyph;473 is approved as of May 31, 1994, supplemental NADA 131&hyph;675 is approved as of July
11, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.905b and 558.258 to reflect the approvals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of NADA 131&hyph;675 is for use of fenbendazole Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated feed. Fenbendazole
is a Category II drug which, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, use of fenbendazole Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds as in NADA 131&hyph;675
requires an approved form FDA 1900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of these applications may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these
supplemental approvals qualify for a 3-year period of marketing exclusivity, for supplemental NADA 121&hyph;473
for this use beginning May 31, 1994, and for supplemental NADA 131&hyph;675 for this use beginning July 11, 1994, because
new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) conducted by the sponsor were
required for the approvals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the establishment of tea standards for the year beginning May
1, 1994, and ending April 30, 1995. The tea standards are provided for under the Tea Importation Act (the Act). The Act
prohibits the importation of a tea that is inferior to the annual tea standard. Under the Act, the importation of a tea
may be withheld until FDA examines the tea and is sure that it complies with the annual standard.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the unique nature of the decisionmaking process for establishing annual standards for tea, the procedural
protections that are part of this process, and the short period within which standards must be set, FDA has never, since
the enactment in 1897 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 41), used notice and comment rulemaking for tea standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each final rule setting the standards is based on the recommendations of the Board of Tea Experts (the board), which
is comprised of tea experts who are representative of the tea trade. The board selects standards each year according
to the provisions of the Act. The board bases its selection on tea samples submitted by members of the tea trade to the
board. Relying primarily on organoleptic examination, the board selects one tea to represent the standard for each
major type of tea imported into the United States. In choosing a standard, the board tries to select one at least equal
in quality to that of the previous year. The Act prohibits the importation of a tea that is inferior to the annual tea
standard. Under the Act, the importation of a tea may be withheld until FDA examines the tea and is sure that it complies
with the annual standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual meeting of the board is open to the public and is announced in advance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. At the annual meeting any interested person may present data, information, or views orally or in writing regarding
new standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual tea standards are prepared and submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by the board (21 CFR
1220.41).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should a tea importer be dissatisfied with an FDA tea examiner's rejection of a shipment of tea, the importer can refer
its complaint to the U.S. Board of Tea Appeals and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals. FDA is unaware of any complaints
or arguments having ever occurred concerning a designated standard, despite the many years since the enactment of
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA concludes that notice and comment rulemaking to set tea standards is impracticable, contrary to the public interest,
and unnecessary by virtue of the factors discussed above, i.e., the unique, longstanding procedures that apply to
establishing a standard, the fact that standards are based principally on organoleptic examinations by tea experts,
the public participation opportunities already provided, and the timeframes required for issuing annual standards.
Hence, the agency is not following notice and comment rulemaking procedures in establishing the final tea standards
for 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of this rule on small entities, including small businesses, was reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) (5 U.S.C. 601). FDA has concluded that this action will not result in a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, FDA certifies, in accordance with section
605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
will derive from this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before August 10, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this regulation. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any changes in this regulation
justified by such comments will be the subject of a further amendment.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule further implements section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 1439(d), so as to maximize flexibility in the provision of the Headquarters Reserve authorized under section
213(d)(4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213(d)(4) permits the Secretary of HUD to retain not more than five percent of the financial assistance that
becomes available under all programs authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (except for public housing
operating subsidy under section 9 and modernization funding under section 14). However, the current regulation
implementing the Headquarters Reserve at &sect;791.407 is more delimited. It only permits a Headquarters Reserve
of five percent of the total amount of budget authority which is ``fair shared'' pursuant to Part 791, Subpart D. The
effect of the regulatory limitation is to narrow considerably the base upon which the five percent reserve is calculated,
as compared to what the statute permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this interim rule, the base would be expanded by including not only the amount of funding which is fair shared
pursuant to the formula at &sect;791.403(b)(2), but also all budget authority allocated for uses that the Secretary
determines are incapable of geographic formula, as spelled out at &sect;791.403(b)(1). Examples of the latter category
include amendments of existing contracts, renewals of assistance contracts, the section 8 loan management and property
disposition accounts, assistance earmarked by the Congress in appropriation law line items, and uses of budget authority
identified in the Department's Operating Plan submitted to the Appropriations Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the amount of funding available under the Headquarters Reserve will be increased by this interim rule, the
limited statutory purposes for which funding is permissible are maintained. Reserve funding can only be used for
unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies,
as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation;
and housing in support of desegregation efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tragedies of recent disasters are a highly visible predicate for this interim rule. The confluence in 1993 of Hurricane
Andrew, Hurricane Iniki, and Typhoon Omar and this year the Northridge earthquake in California have placed substantial
pressure on the Department to provide prompt, efficient assisted housing relief for disaster victims.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the Department finds itself involved in longstanding litigation for which equitable resolution frequently
requires the delivery of housing assistance in order to achieve fair, reasonable settlement. Expanding the ranging
of the Headquarters Reserve will facilitate handling these unpredictable pressures for disaster relief and litigation
settlements, as well as for emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Precisely because the incidence of these types of housing assistance funding are unpredictable, the availability
of readier resources through an increased Reserve is one which HUD will only call upon as needed. That is, although
a greater amount of budget authority will be made available under this interim rule than is the case under the current
regulation, this does not mean that HUD will use the full statutory maximum in this year or any year. The draw upon the
Reserve will be carefully tempered to exigencies and real, immediate need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD notes that the basis upon which the five percent can be calculated does not include the section 202 program of supportive
housing for the elderly. Section 801(b) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) removed
the section 202 program from coverage under section 213(d). However, NAHA did not repeal a previous amendment to section
213(d)(1)(A)(i) made by section 101 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989. This amendment
requires that section 202 assistance be allocated in a manner that ensures that awards of that assistance are made
for projects of sufficient size to accommodate facilities with supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail
elderly residents. Moreover, the Department has elected to continue the fair sharing of section 202 housing assistance
in order to promote fair and balanced geographic diversity. (The fair sharing formula for section 202 assistance
is specifically tailored at &sect;791.402(c)(1) to reflect relevant characteristics of the elderly population.)
Notwithstanding this retention of section 202 allocations in part 791, the statutory range for calculation of the
five percent Headquarters Reserve is now effectively limited to programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937
which are covered by section 213(d). Therefore, the revision to &sect;791.407 under this interim rule limits_for
calculation purposes_the Reserve to five percent under those 1937 Act programs.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
interim rule, and in so doing certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The interim rule revises existing procedures for the allocation of housing assistance
funds and for local government and HUD review of applications for housing assistance, but will make no change in the
economic impact of these procedures on small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this interim rule relate only to internal administrative
procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project
areas or building sites, and therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, this interim rule will not substantially
alter the established roles of HUD and the States and local governments, including PHAs, in administering the affected
programs. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
interim rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this interim rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

G. Justification for Interim Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR Part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from the general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this interim rule for effect without first soliciting public
comment, in that prior public comment is contrary to the public interest because immediate effectiveness of this
interim rule will permit the Department to respond immediately to housing assistance needs brought on by natural
and other disasters, housing needs resulting from emergencies arising from unpredictable and sudden circumstances
causing housing deprivation or causing an unforeseen and significant increase in lower income housing demands in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with an additional requirement, a proposed amendment to the Utah permanent regulatory program
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
Utah proposes revisions to its rules pertaining to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation of rules, petitions to
initiate rulemaking, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality
of coal exploration information, permit application requirements pertaining to blasting and hydrology, and mining
in special areas, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors. The amendment incorporates the additional
flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarifies ambiguities, and improves operational efficiency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated August 2, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;851), Utah submitted to OSM a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1201&hyph;1328, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Chapter VII (the
Federal regulations). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Utah proposed revisions to the
Utah Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) at Utah Administrative Rules (Utah
Admin. R.) 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, scope of rulemaking, and 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, promulgation of rules. Utah
also proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, petitions to initiate
rulemaking; 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, hearing requirement for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and
reclamation operations; 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, confidentiality of coal exploration information; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661,
permit application blasting level chart; 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, permit application cross sections and maps
showing hydrologic information; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 and 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, special areas
of mining, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposed to delete the scope of rulemaking provision at Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;100 that requires
the Board to promulgate such procedural and substantive rules it deems useful or necessary to implement statutory
duties, fulfill its statutory obligations, or interpret the statutory authority under which it operates. At Utah
Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, Utah proposed to revise the procedures for promulgation of rules to provide that
the Board will promulgate rules under the authority provided at Utah Code Annotated (UCA) Sections 40&hyph;6&hyph;5,
40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, Utah proposed that
persons other than the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) or the Board may petition to initiate rulemaking
pursuant to Utah Admin. R. 641 and the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, UCA 63&hyph;46&hyph;8. At Utah Admin.
R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposed that within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate
an area unsuitable for coal mining, the Board shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the area covered by the petition
``unless the petitioners and intervenors agree.'' At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposed to revise
its coal exploration confidentiality provision to require that the Division will not make information available
for public inspection, if the person submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed
and the information is classified as being protected, private, or controlled under the Utah Government Records Access
and Management Act (GRAMA) or confidential under other applicable State or Federal laws, rules, or regulations.
At Utah Admin. R 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661, Utah proposed to delete the reference to UCA 63&hyph;46a&hyph;3(7)(a)
and reference only Figure 1 in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.67, which shows the maximum allowable ground particle
velocity for blasting operations. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, Utah proposed to add to its hydrology
permit application requirements that the Division may, depending on the structures and facilities located in the
permit area, require other relevant cross sections and maps, in addition to those cross sections and maps already
specifically required by the State's existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed
to revise its prime farmland permit application content requirements to indicate that U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Soils Handbooks 436 (Soil Taxonomy) and 18 (Soil Survey Manual) are incorporated on the effective date, rather
than the date of adoption, of Utah Admin. R. 645. Also, at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed
to delete the statement that notices of changes made to the USDA handbooks will be periodically published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, Utah proposed to revise its alluvial valley floor water quality requirement
by adding language that incorporates by reference the specific publication by Maas and Hoffman, ``Crop Salt Tolerance_Current
Assessment,'' Table 1, ``Salt Tolerance of Agricultural Crops.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 27, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(58 FR 45305, administrative record No. UT&hyph;865), and in the same document, opened the public comment period
and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public
comment period closed on September 27, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for September 21, 1993, was not held because
no one requested an opportunity to testify.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, regarding the incorrect
reference to its rulemaking authority at UCA 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), which was repealed by Utah in 1993; (2) Utah
Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners and intervenors to change
the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200,
regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is confidential,'' which would impart a change
in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is or is not allowed to be held confidential under
the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's GRAMA in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found
to be less effective than the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions Utah's GRAMA imposes on the availability
of coal exploration information; and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, regarding the need to use the
prime farmland soil survey standards in USDA Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as
it existed on November 16, 1982. OSM notified Utah of these concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;878).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated January 7, 1994, Utah responded to OSM's concerns by submitting revisions to its proposed program
amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881). Utah proposed the following revisions to its existing rules.
At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Utah proposed to reference UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), which applies to rulemaking
authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposed that
(1) unless the petitioners and intervenors agree otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months
after receipt of a complete petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors
agree that a public hearing is not needed, the hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R.
645&hyph;103&hyph;441 will be held in the locality of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200,
Utah proposed to require that the Division will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person
submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential
under the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed to require
that USDA Soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982,
and November 16, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17,
finds, with an additional requirement, that the proposed program amendment as submitted by Utah on August 2, 1993,
and as revised on January 7, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to the following previously-approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 (30 CFR 764.17), hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for
coal mining and reclamation operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760 (30 CFR 779.24, 779.25, and 780.14 for surface mining, and 783.24, 783.25,
and 784.23 for underground mining), permit application cross sections and maps showing hydrologic information,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310 (30 CFR 785.19), special areas of mining, specifically alluvial valley
floors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved Utah rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director
finds that these proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these
proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Rules That Are Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the
Federal Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a parenthetical note, existing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 (1) incorporates by reference Figure
1 in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.67, which shows the maximum allowable ground vibration for blasting operations,
(2) cites its administrative procedures statute at UCA 63&hyph;46a&hyph;3(7)(a) as the authority for incorporating
this figure into its rules, and (3) indicates that the figure can be viewed in the Division's office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposed to delete the reference to its statutory authority for incorporating the figure from the Federal regulations
into its rules. This deletion does not render Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 less effective than the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 816.67(d)(4)(i). In fact, the proposed State rule includes requirements that are substantively
identical to the requirements of the Federal regulation. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Scope of Rulemaking and Promulgation of Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to delete Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, relating to scope of rulemaking. The effect of this
proposed deletion on the Utah program is nonsubstantive because (1) this rule only generally described Utah's authority
to promulgate rules for its statutes and (2) the concepts contained in this rule are repeated with more specificity
at Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, which Utah proposed to recodify as Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise recodified Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, to indicate that the Board will promulgate rules
under the authority of UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, a provision of the Utah Oil and Gas Conservation Act, provides the statutory authority for
jurisdiction of the Board over oil, gas, and mining operations. UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), a provision of the Utah
Mined Land Reclamation Act, provides that, in addition to the powers, functions, and duties provided to the Board
in UCA 40&hyph;6, the Board has the power, function, and duty ``to enact rules according to the procedures and requirements
of Title 63, Chapter 46a, that are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.'' UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1),
a provision of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, provides that, in addition to the powers, functions, and duties
of the Board and Division provided in UCA 40&hyph;8, the Board and Division have the power, function and duty ``to make
and promulgate in accordance with Title 63, Chapter 46a, the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, such rules as are
specifically necessary for the regulation of coal mining operations and reclamation operations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed references in Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112 to UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1),
which give the Board the necessary powers to enact rules regulating oil, gas and mining operations, are consistent
with the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 732.15(b), which requires a State regulatory authority to possess the authority,
under State law, to implement, administer, and enforce all of the applicable requirements of Subchapter K of the Federal
regulations. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed rule.

4. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, Petition to Initiate Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500 to provide that ``persons other than the Division or
Board'' may petition to initiate rulemaking pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board at Utah Admin.
R. 641 and the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act at UCA 63&hyph;46&hyph;8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah's definition of ``person'' at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(14) is substantively identical to the definition of ``person''
at section 701(19) of SMCRA. Also, Utah's definition of ``person'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 is substantively
identical to the definition of ``person'' in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.5. Both definitions include units
and instrumentalities ``of Federal, State, or local government,'' such as the Board and the Division.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12 provide that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 person may petition the Director to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any regulation
under SMCRA. Utah's proposed revision would appear to prohibit the Division or Board from petitioning to initiate
rulemaking. There is no similar prohibition provided in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12, which allow any
person, including groups, organizations, and other entities, regardless of affiliation, to petition to initiate
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1) (Powers, Functions, and Duties of the Board and Division), the Board and Division
have the authority to make and promulgate rules for the regulation of coal mining operations and reclamation operations.
Therefore, it is not necessary for either the Board or the Division to have the right to petition to initiate rulemaking.
Under UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1), the Board and Division, as the governmental entities entrusted with the regulation
of surface coal mining in Utah, are the initiators of rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM specifically interprets the proposed amendment, however, to allow an individual member of the Board or employee
of the Division, in his or her capacity as an individual, to petition the Board to initiate rulemaking. Section 102(i)
of SMCRA provides that one of its purposes is the protection of the right of the public to participate in the rulemaking
process. Utah may not deny any member of the Board or any employee of the Division the right to petition the Board for
rulemaking, as such a denial would render the State program inconsistent with section 102(i) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On this basis, the Director (1) finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500 is no less effective than the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 700.12 and (2) approves the proposed rule.

5. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Permit Application Contents for Prime Farmland
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 to provide that, with respect to prime farmland
soil survey standards, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they
respectively existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 785.17(c)(1)(i) provides that U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and
18 are incorporated by reference as they existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982. Therefore, the USDA handbooks
incorporated by reference into Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, and handbooks incorporated by reference
into the Federal regulation, are the same. On the basis, the Director (1) finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110
is no less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 785.17(c) (1)(i) and (2) approves the proposed rule.

6. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Confidentiality of Coal Exploration Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 to provide that the information submitted as part of
a coal exploration permit is confidential (1) if the person submitting it requests in writing at the time of submission
that it not be disclosed and (2) the information is confidential under the standards of the ``Federal Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, Utah defines the ``Federal Act'' to mean SMCRA. The Federal regulation
at 30 CFR 772.15(b), which implements SMCRA and corresponds to Utah's proposed rule, provides that information shall
be kept confidential if (1) the person submitting it requests in writing at the time of submission that it not be disclosed
and (2) the information concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to
the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reference to the ``Federal Act'' in proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 lacks specificity and could
be interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with the second part of 30 CFR 772.15(b), which requires that information
can be kept confidential only if it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating
to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, for the reasons stated above, approves proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, but requires
Utah to submit an additional amendment providing that coal exploration permit application information may not be
kept confidential unless it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating
to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.

1. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.

2. Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on Utah's proposed amendment from the Administrator
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various
other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_By letter dated October 7, 1993, MSHA raised a concern that in one area Utah's proposed rules may conflict with MSHA's
30 CFR part 77 regulations (administrative record No. UT&hyph;873). MSHA stated that the proposed rules refer to
tables and charts regarding allowable airblast, ground vibration, and particle velocity due to surface blasting
but that MSHA's regulations do not specify and/or limit these values for surface blasting. MSHA also stated that,
in addition, its regulation at 30 CFR 77.1303(j) provides for the protection of underground miners when surface blasting
occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to MSHA's statement that its regulations at 30 CFR part 77 do not limit surface mines for airblast, ground
vibration, and particle velocity, the Director, as discussed in finding No. 2, finds that Utah's surface mining blasting
limitations at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 are substantively identical to, and no less effective
than, OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 816.67(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to MSHA's statement that its regulation at 30 CFR 77.1303(j) provides for the protection of underground
miners when surface blasting occurs, the Director notes that existing rules in the Utah program, and the corresponding
Federal regulations, provide for such protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to MSHA's implication that Utah's surface mine blasting rules should also provide protection for underground
miners, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524 and 524.641, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.61(d)(1)(ii)
and 816.67(d)(1), require that (1) blasting operations conducted within 500 feet of active underground mines must
have MSHA approval and (2) underground mines must be protected from damage by establishment of a maximum allowable
limit for ground vibration before initiation of blasting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Director is not requiring Utah to modify its rules in response to MSHA's comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated February 28, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;896), MSHA responded to the revisions proposed
by Utah in its January 7, 1994, submittal (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881), by stating that ``it appears there
is no conflict with the requirements of 30 CFR.''

Other Agencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_By letters dated August 25, 1993, and January 27, 1994, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that it found the changes
to Utah's regulatory program to be satisfactory (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;863 and UT&hyph;890).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 26, 1993, the Bureau of Mines stated that it had no comment because the amendment would not affect
minerals other than coal (administrative record No. UT&hyph;864).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letters dated August 27, 1993, and February 1, 1994 (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;867 and UT&hyph;892),
EPA stated that it had no comments on the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated February 14, 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated it found nothing of significant concern
to the Fish and Wildlife Service (administrative record No. UT&hyph;895).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to solicit the written concurrence of the Administrator
of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;857).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), the Director provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and the ACHP for comment.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with an additional requirement, the proposed amendment that
Utah submitted on August 2, 1993, as subsequently revised on January 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the Director approves Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760,
645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661; 641&hyph;112; 645&hyph;100&hyph;500; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding No. 6, the Director approves Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 but requires Utah to revise
it to provide that coal exploration permit application information may not be kept confidential unless it concerns
trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the persons
intending to conduct coal exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director approves the rules as proposed by Utah with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical
form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 944, codifying decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1291(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the
``Regulations''), to add new entries to appendices A and B. Appendix A, Organizations Determined to be Within the
Term ``Government of Libya'' (Specially Designated Nationals of Libya), is a list of organizations determined by
the Director of FAC to be within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya,'' as set forth in &sect;550.304(a)
of the Regulations, because they are owned or controlled by or act or purport to act directly or indirectly on behalf
of the Government of Libya. Appendix B, Individuals Determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government
of Libya, lists individuals determined by the Director of FAC to be acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly
on behalf of the Government of Libya, and thus to fall within the term ``Government of Libya'' in &sect;550.304(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of the designation of Arab Turkish Bank, Libya Insurance
Company, Maghreban International Trade Company, Saving and Real Estate Investment Bank, and Societe Maghrebine
d'Investissement et de Participation as Specially Designated Nationals of Libya. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of nine individuals determined to be Specially Designated
Nationals of the Government of Libya: Yousef Abd&hyph;El&hyph;Razegh Abdelmulla, Ayad S. Dahaim, El Hadi M. El&hyph;Fighi,
Kamel El&hyph;Khallas, Mohammed Mustafa Ghadban, Mohammed Lahmar, Ragiab Saad Madi, Bashir M. Sharif, and Kassem
M. Sherlala. Six of these individuals are present or former directors or managers of Arab Turkish Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of Libya apply to the entities and individuals identified
in appendices A and B. All unlicensed transactions with such entities or persons, or transactions in property in which
they have an interest, are prohibited unless otherwise exempted or generally licensed in the Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determinations that persons fall within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya'' and are thus Specially
Designated Nationals are effective upon the date of determination by the Director of FAC, acting under authority
delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice of such a determination is effective upon the date of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication or upon earlier actual notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of Specially Designated Nationals in appendices A and B is a partial one, since FAC may not be aware of all agencies
and officers of the Government of Libya, or of all persons that might be owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of
the Government of Libya within the meaning of &sect;550.304(a). Therefore, one may not rely on the fact that a person
is not listed in appendix A or B as a Specially Designated National as evidence that it is not owned or controlled by,
or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the Government of Libya. The Treasury Department
regards it as incumbent upon all persons governed by the Regulations to take reasonable steps to ascertain for themselves
whether persons with whom they deal are owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act on behalf of, the Government
of Libya, or on behalf of other countries subject to blocking or transactional restrictions administered by FAC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1705, provides for civil penalties not
to exceed $10,000 for each violation of the Regulations. Criminal violations of the Regulations are punishable by
fines of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years per count, or both, for individuals and criminal fines of up
to $500,000 per count for organizations. See 50 U.S.C. 1705; 18 U.S.C. 3571.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning income exclusions
in death cases. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that secured debts cannot be considered ``just debts''
for purposes of the income exclusion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rates payable under VA's income-based benefit programs, pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation,
are affected by the claimant's income. As countable income goes up, the rate payable goes down. The law does, however,
provide certain exclusions from countable income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(3) excludes amounts paid by a surviving spouse or child of a deceased veteran for the veteran's just
debts from countable income; 38 U.S.C. 1315(f)(1)(H) provides a similar exclusion for a dependent parent of a deceased
veteran who pays a deceased spouse's just debts. The term ``just debts,'' however, is not currently defined by statute
or regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a precedent opinion dated August 5, 1993 (OGC Prec 5&hyph;93), VA's General Counsel held that amounts paid by a surviving
spouse on secured obligations incurred for the purchase of real or personal property could not be excluded as ``just
debts'' under 38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(3)(A). Based on the principles in OGC Prec 5&hyph;93, we have amended 38 CFR 3.262(m),
3.262(o), and 3.272(h) to state that the term ``just debts'' does not include secured debts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of section 603 and 604.

 Florida has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between
July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990, otherwise known as Non-HSWA Cluster VI. These requirements are listed in Section B
of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision,
subject to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions.
Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270.

B. Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908,
January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III,
IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program
revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program
revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written
comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until August 10, 1994. Copies of Florida's application for these program
revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective September 9, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice
containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision.

C. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Florida's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised, except where otherwise noted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this Notice. Florida also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Florida's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows:

under the agricultural land laws and location under the United States mining laws (30 U.S.C. Ch. 2 (1988)), but not
from leasing under the mineral leasing laws, to protect the land while the State of California conducts a study of the
area to determine the feasibility of locating the proposed Ward Valley Low-Level Radioactive Waste Facility at the
site, and for other purposes:

1. The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) filed a petition (RM&hyph;8008), Public Notice No. 1894, requesting
that the Commission amend Part 80 of the Rules, 47 CFR Part 80, to require registration of emergency position indicating
radiobeacons (EPIRBs) operating on the frequency 406.025 MHz with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). Additionally, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in PR Docket No. 92&hyph;125 (58 FR 30126, 5/26/93), the Commission stated that it would address separately the issue
of mandatory registration of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) operating on the frequency 406.025 MHz in the
Aviation Services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Beacon registration is essential to realize the full benefit of the 406 MHz satellite system. The Air Force, Coast
Guard, NOAA and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agree that having access to registration information
along with the improved location accuracy of the 406 MHz system can result in a reduction of the time needed to complete
a SAR operation. NOAA and NASA estimate that registration will save on average 6 hours per mission. Further, NOAA states
that its experience with voluntary registration of 406 EPIRBs shows that when 406 EPIRBs are registered in its database
the Coast Guard has been able to avoid unnecessarily using SAR resources by screening false distress signals through
telephone calls to registered owners. Typical mission costs of launching a single helicopter to locate and investigate
a distress signal are approximately $4,000. The potential savings to the Federal government and SAR forces are substantial
with no additional cost or burden to manufacturers and little burden to beacon users. The beacon user would be required
to mail to NOAA the pre-paid, pre-addressed post card that the manufacturers currently provide requesting registration
information. In view of the strong support, and because beacon registration can provide valuable distress information
to SAR personnel concerning the type and size of the aircraft/vessel as well as prevent launching potentially dangerous
missions on false distress signals, we will require that 406 MHz ELTs and 406 MHz EPIRBs be registered in NOAA's database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rule making proceeding because if the
proposed rule amendments are promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The change proposed herein
will have a beneficial effect on the marine and aviation community by enhancing information available to SAR personnel
for use in distress situations and will not have a significant economic impact on any entity. The Secretary shall send
a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the
Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No.
96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612 (1980).

 NMFS publishes this interpretive rule to clarify the definition of the landing requirement in Federal regulations
implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Crustacean Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The purpose
of this action is to remove an unintended barrier to fishermen who might have difficulty renewing their limited entry
permits because there was no quota in 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule implementing Amendment 7 (57 FR 10437, March 26, 1992) to the FMP established a limited entry program
for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Among the provisions implemented was the establishment of a landing requirement
for renewing permits each year. The Code of Federal Regulations at 50 CFR 681.30(c)(2) states that a permit will be
renewed for a subsequent year only if the permitted vessel was used to: (i) land the equivalent of at least four lobsters
for each trap normally used, calculated over 1 calendar year [the landing requirement] and (ii) make the landings
during at least one of the 2 years prior to the year for which the new permit would be valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a permit were not renewed or were revoked, others could apply for the unused permit. The purpose of the rule was to
ensure that only active fishermen held permits, thereby achieving the maximum benefit from the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit holders were notified by letter in December 1992 that the 1992 fishing year would be the first year to be considered
as a qualifying year. However, in 1993, the quota was set at zero lobsters because the resource was not of a sufficient
size to support a fishery. As a result, those fishermen who had not fished in 1992 would have been required by Federal
regulations to land a minimum number of lobsters in 1993 to obtain a permit for the 1994 fishing season, but also were
forbidden by Federal regulations to fish. Therefore, the rule is being amended to make the regulations clear that
the landing requirement: (1) will not apply until at least 2 years of lobster fishing has occurred beginning in 1992;
and (2) must be met in one of the 2 most recent years in which lobster fishing under the limited entry program was authorized.
Since lobster fishing under the limited entry program was authorized in 1992, and will be authorized in 1994, the landing
requirement will first be applied to permit renewals for the 1995 lobster season.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 523 of NAFTA amended section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) by enacting a new subsection (h)
authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the development and
implementation of an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system to be used for the collection of depository taxes. The
depository taxes are the taxes required to be deposited with an authorized financial institution or Federal Reserve
bank pursuant to any regulations prescribed by the Secretary (generally FICA and railroad retirement taxes, income
tax withheld, corporate income and estimated taxes, and various Federal excise taxes). The new system will be designed
to ensure that the depository taxes are credited to the Treasury's general account by the due date of the deposit.

A. Current Tax Deposit System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, taxpayers are required to deposit taxes with an authorized government depository (generally, a commercial
bank or savings institution or a Federal Reserve bank) by various dates specified in regulations. Each deposit must
be accompanied by Form 8109, Federal Tax Deposit Coupon, which contains the taxpayer's name, identification number,
the amount and type of tax being deposited, and the tax period for which the deposit is being made. The government depository
forwards the coupon to the appropriate IRS Service Center. The Service Center compares the information entered on
the coupon with the liabilities reported by the taxpayer on the return for the applicable tax period. The funds are
transferred by the depository to the Treasury on the business date following the date of the deposit.

B. An Electronic Tax Deposit System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6302(h) of the Code authorizes a new system which will allow for the transfer of tax deposit amounts electronically
from taxpayer accounts to the Treasury's general account. The new system will be phased in over a period of several
fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 1994 (October 1, 1993, to September 30, 1994), by gradually increasing the
percentage of the total depository taxes required to be collected by EFT. The temporary regulations implement this
phase-in by gradually increasing the number of taxpayers that must deposit all of their depository taxes by EFT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to deposit by EFT under these temporary regulations applies only to those taxpayers required to make
deposits pursuant to regulations under section 6302 of the Code, and only for those taxes required to be deposited.
At present, many small taxpayers are excluded from the various deposit requirements imposed by regulations under
section 6302. For example, filers of Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, are not required to make deposits
for any calendar quarter in which the net tax liability reported on the Form 720 does not exceed $2,000. Similarly,
filers of Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, are not required to make deposits for any calendar quarter
in which the liability reported on the Form 941 is less than $500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary regulations, with one exception, do not apply to taxes with respect to wages for domestic service in
the private home of an employer because these taxes are not required to be deposited but are remitted quarterly with
Form 942, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return for Household Employees. The sole exception is if the employer
is a sole proprietor filing Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, who chooses to report wages to household
employees on that form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to achieve an expedited and orderly conversion to an EFT system, NAFTA prescribed a schedule of minimum percentages
of taxes that must be deposited by EFT during a phase-in period. These percentages depend in part on whether the taxes
are: (a) The taxes imposed by chapters 21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), 22 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act),
and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the Code, or (b) ``other'' depository taxes (generally corporate
income taxes and various excise taxes). The statutorily prescribed minimum percentages for each year are as follows:

For the period prior to January 1, 1995, the first step of the phase-in of the EFT system will be carried out through binding
agreements entered into between the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and certain third party bulk data processors
(processors) under which the processors have committed to make deposits of Federal depository taxes of certain of
their customers by EFT in such a manner as to ensure that the amounts are credited to the general account of the Treasury
by the deposit due date. These agreements will take effect beginning in the latter part of fiscal year 1994 and will
continue for a period of time into fiscal year 1995. A taxpayer who is a customer of a processor that is a party to one of
these agreements may have its deposits that are subject to such an agreement made by the processor pursuant to the terms
of the agreement until the expiration or termination of the agreement. However, the taxpayer continues to be responsible
for the deposit of those depository taxes that are not subject to such agreement. If a taxpayer whose deposits are being
made by a processor pursuant to such an agreement becomes required to deposit by electronic funds transfer pursuant
to &sect;31.6302&hyph;1T(h)(1)(ii) of these temporary regulations, the taxpayer is responsible for making deposits
by electronic funds transfer of those depository taxes not subject to the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For periods after December 31, 1994, the temporary regulations require that deposits be made by EFT based on the taxpayer's
total deposits of taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during certain ``determination'' periods. If a taxpayer's
total deposits of the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during the determination period exceed a prescribed
dollar threshold, the taxpayer must begin depositing by EFT on and after the applicable effective date prescribed
in the regulations, unless otherwise exempted. (A taxpayer will become subject to the EFT requirement for the applicable
effective date ``January 1, 1996'' by exceeding the threshold amount during either calendar years 1993 or 1994).
The phase-in schedule is as follows:

The thresholds set forth in this phase-in schedule have been set by taking into account the minimum percentages prescribed
by NAFTA, the need for administrative convenience and simplicity, and the potential need for exemptions from the
EFT system for certain small businesses. Therefore, the thresholds for the January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996 effective
dates were specifically set to satisfy the statutory minimum percentages. The $50,000 threshold for the January
1, 1997 effective date will result in receipts of depository taxes somewhat in excess of the percentage prescribed
by NAFTA. For purposes of administrative convenience and simplicity, this threshold was adopted to require the participation
of an entire class of taxpayers, that is, those taxpayers that are classified as ``semi-weekly'' depositors of employment
taxes (the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24). Finally, the $20,000 threshold for the January 1, 1999 effective
date was set to satisfy the statutory percentage while allowing for the possibility that the smallest of depositors
will be exempted from the EFT system. As described in paragraph C of this preamble, the IRS solicits comments on the
impact of these regulations on small businesses. Based on those comments, the IRS will determine those categories
of small businesses, if any, that should be exempted from the EFT requirements, and may adjust the threshold for the
January 1, 1999 effective date to bring in additional taxpayers while at the same time accommodating any appropriate
exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although only the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 are used to determine whether a taxpayer is subject to the
EFT deposit requirement, the requirement, once triggered, applies to all federal taxes (not just the taxes imposed
by chapters 21, 22, and 24) that the taxpayer is required to deposit pursuant to regulations prescribed under section
6302 of the Code. Once a taxpayer becomes subject to the EFT deposit requirement, the taxpayer must continue to deposit
by EFT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present the IRS has in place a voluntary electronic funds transfer (EFT) system in which a taxpayer may by telephone
or computer effectuate an electronic funds transfer through the use of one of two payment options: debit and credit.
The debit option is effected by using a Financial Agent of the Department of Treasury. The taxpayer requests the Financial
Agent to initiate the transfer of funds from the taxpayer's bank account(s) to Treasury's general account and transmit
the related tax payment data, supplied by the taxpayer, to the IRS. The credit option is effected by using the taxpayer's
financial institution. The taxpayer requests the financial institution to initiate the transfer of funds to the
Treasury's general account and submit the related tax data, supplied by the taxpayer, to a Financial Agent for transmission
to the IRS. The EFT system required to be used in connection with these regulations will employ similar options and
procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6302(h)(1)(B) of the Code, as added by NAFTA, provides that the regulations may contain such exemptions as
the Secretary may deem appropriate. The Senate Report accompanying section 6302(h) strongly encourages the Secretary
of the Treasury to consider the impact of the regulations on small businesses. S. Rep. No. 103&hyph;189, 103d Cong.,
1st Sess., at 61 et. seq. (1993). The report recommends that the regulations should not create hardships for small
businesses and that no small business should be required to purchase computers or gain access to any electronic equipment
other than a touch-tone telephone. Further, the report urges the Secretary to take into account the specific needs
of small employers, including possible exemption for the very smallest businesses from the new electronic funds
transfer system. The phase-in schedule included in the temporary regulations defers use of the EFT system by the smallest
businesses until at least calendar year 2000. The IRS welcomes comments about the impact of the temporary regulations
on small businesses and will consider any suggestions regarding how small businesses should be treated under the
regulations in order to implement Congressional intent. Based on the comments and suggestions received, the IRS
will determine those categories of small businesses, if any, that should be exempted from the EFT requirements and
publish such determinations in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that these temporary regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866.
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, a copy of these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Internal Revenue Code requires the Secretary to prescribe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as may be necessary for the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of an electronic funds transfer system to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the collection of depository taxes as described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h)(2) of this section. Section 6302(h)(2) of the Code provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a phase-in schedule which sets forth escalating minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentages of those depository taxes to be deposited by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer, starting with the fiscal year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning October 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 1994. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section prescribes the rules necessary for implementing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer system for collection of depository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxes and for effecting an orderly and expeditious phase-in of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commissioner of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue has entered into binding agreements with third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party bulk data processors. These agreements require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third party bulk processors deposit certain depository taxes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain of their customers by electronic funds transfer in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner designed to ensure that those amounts are credited to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general account of the Treasury by the deposit due date. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer who is a customer of a third party bulk data processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is a party to such an agreement may have its deposits that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to such agreement made by the processor until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration or termination of the agreement. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer continues to be responsible for the deposit of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depository taxes that are not subject to such agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code during a 12-month determination period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the applicable threshold amount are required to deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all depository taxes (as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section) due on and after the applicable effective date by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section) unless exempted under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, each applicable effective date has one 12-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination period. However, for the applicable effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1996, there are two determination periods. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable threshold amount is exceeded in either of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination periods, the taxpayer becomes subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1996. The threshold amounts, determination periods, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and applicable effective dates are as follows:

funds transfer pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer will continue to deposit by electronic funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer. Until such time as a taxpayer is required by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section to deposit by electronic funds transfer, the taxpayer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily make deposits by electronic funds transfer, or must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is revising its regulations on inmate release preparation to provide for greater
standardization for institution programs and to make various editorial or organizational changes. As revised,
this program is intended to enhance the likelihood that sentenced inmates will successfully reintegrate into the
community upon their release from incarceration.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Pre-Release Program (28 CFR part 571, subpart A), which will now
be entitled Release Preparation Program. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 30, 1980 (45 FR 44234) and was amended on September 30, 1983 (48 FR 45053). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary change in these amendments is to provide for greater standardization in release preparation programming
at Bureau institutions. New section 571.13 contains the core curriculum of topics/courses to be offered. Other amendments
are primarily editorial in nature and make no change in the intent of the regulations. For ease of use, the entire subpart
is being revised. A summary of the changes follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the title of the program has been changed from ``pre-release program'' to ``release preparation program''.
This change is reflected in revised &sect;571.10, &sect;571.11 (b) and (d) (formerly &sect;571.11(a) (2) and (4)),
&sect;571.12 (a) and (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 571.10 is further amended to reflect the Bureau's recognition of the continuity of an inmate's needs for release
preparation and to standardize the release preparation program for all sentenced inmates reintegrating into the
community from Bureau facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 571.11 is further amended by adjusting the codification for the purpose of editorial consistency. Former
paragraph (a)(1) has been removed. This provision is addressed more completely in new &sect;571.13 (b). As revised,
the introductory text and paragraph (a) of new &sect;571.11 specify that a designated staff member has the responsibility
to determine the general release needs of the inmate population. These provisions replace the provisions of former
paragraphs (a) introductory text and (a)(2). Former paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) are revised as paragraphs (b) and (d),
and a new paragraph (c) is added specifying that the designated staff member chairs the institution's Release Preparation
Program Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;571.12, paragraph (b) has been revised to remove reference to requirements for inmate participation in
a specific number of sessions. The intent of the revised paragraph is that the inmate is responsible for registering
in recommended release preparation courses. Documentation of the inmate's participation in the program serves
to help staff measure the institutional adjustment of the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions in former paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of &sect;571.12 have been revised as paragraphs (c), (d), and
(e) of a new &sect;571.13 on the institution release preparation program. New paragraph (a) of &sect;571.13 specifies
that the institution's release preparation program shall be administered by the Release Preparation Program Committee.
New paragraph (b) of &sect;571.13 states the core curriculum of the institution program: health and nutrition, employment,
personal finance/consumer skills, information/community resources, release requirements and procedures, and
personal growth and development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these changes are administrative in nature and do not impose further restrictions on inmates, the Bureau
finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice
of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may
submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered
but will receive no response in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) An inmate who is not being released through a Community Corrections Center (CCC) may ask staff to request the assistance
of a United States Probation Officer in establishing a release plan. Bureau staff are to encourage the inmate to give
at least one employment lead or contact. Where the inmate or the inmate's family has already identified employment,
the case manager shall notify the United States Probation Officer so that the usual verification of release plans
may be made. Where employment has not been identified, the case manager shall notify the United States Probation Officer
of the employment need. This notification should ordinarily occur at least six weeks prior to the inmate's release.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 11, 1994, the Board requested comment on a proposal to amend Regulation DD (Truth in Savings) dealing with crediting
and compounding practices and having the effect of producing an annual percentage yield (APY) that reflects the time
value of money. The Board is extending the comment period for 60 days to give the public additional time to provide comments.
In addition, the Board is publishing for comment a further alternative for APY calculations that would allow institutions
to disclose an APY equal to the contract interest rate on time accounts with maturities greater than one year that do
not compound interest but pay interest at least annually. This alternative would provide the Board with a more modest
option as it considers a final resolution to problems with APY calculations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) requires depository institutions to provide disclosures to consumers
about their deposit accounts, including an annual percentage yield (APY) on interest-bearing accounts. The act
is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective June 21, 1993 (see 57 FR 43337
and 58 FR 15077). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the current formula for calculating the APY assumes that interest remains on deposit until maturity, the
resulting APY may_but does not always_reflect the time value of money. The formula produces an APY that is less than
the contract interest rate for long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) that are noncompounding but pay interest
periodically. On December 6, 1993, the Board published a proposal that called for an additional APY formula that would
have factored into the APY calculation the specific time intervals for interest paid on the account_that is, the time
value of money (58 FR 64190). The proposal was withdrawn on May 11, based on considerations of cost and regulatory burden
(59 FR 24376).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of deliberations about the December 1993 proposal, the Board considered related issues regarding
depository institutions' compounding and crediting practices. On May 11, 1994, the Board proposed amendments to
clarify the relationship between compounding and crediting and provide an alternative basis for eliminating anomalies
produced by the current APY formula (59 FR 24378). The Board has received requests for an extension of the proposal's
comment period, due to end on July 5, 1994; the Board is extending the comment period to September 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Alternative APY Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition to extending the comment period on the current proposal, the Board has decided to solicit comment on an
alternative approach for APY calculations. Under this alternative, the only institutions affected would be those
offering noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually. Those institutions would disclose
an APY equal to the interest rate, regardless of whether interest payments were made annually or more frequently.
The APY for all other accounts would reflect the interest rate paid and any compounding. Interest payments by check
or transfer would not be factored into the APY calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This alternative (called Approach B in the December 1993 proposal) was considered by the Board in its deliberations
on adding a new APY formula. The Board declined to adopt Approach B at that time, mainly based on concerns about the limited
resolution of anomalies associated with the APY and costs associated with its implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of factors have led the Board to reopen comments on this alternative. The Congress chose the APY as the primary
uniform measurement for comparison shopping among deposit accounts. The Board believes the APY formula should produce
a mathematical figure that is easily understood and readily reveals to consumers an account's comparative value.
The Board also believes that regulatory compliance should be as simple and cost-effective as possible, and that reductions
in product variety and consumer choice due to regulatory requirements should be minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking all these factors into account, and recognizing that all formulas contain assumptions that are valid in some
circumstances and not in others, the Board seeks comment on whether this limited approach would achieve a satisfactory
resolution of the competing interests for accuracy, consumer understanding, product flexibility, and ease of compliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also solicits comment on whether adoption of such an alternative would reduce the incentive for institutions
to offer compounding multi-year CDs. For example, assume two institutions offer a two-year CD with a 6.00% interest
rate; one mandates monthly interest checks, the other offers annual compounding. Both could advertise a 6.00% APY,
even though a consumer depositing $1,000 receives $120 if interest checks are paid annually and $123.60 if money is
left in the account.

(2) Proposed Regulatory Revisions: Section-by-Section Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A section-by-section description of proposed amendments follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 230.4_Account Disclosures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
Paragraph (b)(6)_Features of Time Accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulation requires a disclosure for institutions offering time accounts that compound interest and permit
a consumer to withdraw accrued interest during the account term. The disclosure states that the APY assumes interest
remains on deposit until maturity and that a withdrawal of interest will reduce earnings. The Board request comments
on whether a similar disclosure would be helpful to consumers purchasing noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay
interest at least annually and disclose an APY equal to the interest rate. For example, the disclosure would alert
consumers that dollar earnings will be less than for a multi-year CD with the same maturity (and disclosing the same
APY) that compounds annually. The Board solicits suggestions for text that would be most helpful to consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 230.8_Advertising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
Paragraph (c)(6)_Features of Time Accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulation requires institutions advertising APYs to disclose other key features about the account. The Board
solicits comment on whether institutions advertising an APY equal to the interest rate on noncompounding multi-year
accounts that make interest payments annually should be required also to make a disclosure like the one discussed
above. If so, the Board solicits suggestions for text that would be helpful to consumers and take into account the constraints
of advertising media.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes special conditions for the General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B
turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the requirements of Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) 14 CFR part 33, including the requirements of &sect;33.94, Blade Containment and Rotor Unbalance
Test, relative to the location of fan blade fracture for the containment test, do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for the certification of the GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines. This finding
is based on a novel or unusual design feature of the GE90 fan blade. Therefore, this document proposes special conditions
which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness
standards of part 33 of the FAR.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 16, 1991, General Electric Aircraft Engines applied for type certification of Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B
turbofan engines. These engines incorporate a first stage fan blade manufactured using carbon graphite composite
material. This unusual design feature results in the GE90 fan blade having significant difference in material property
characteristics when compared to conventionally designed fan blades using non-composite materials. For example,
the probability that a composite fan blade will fail below the inner flowpath diameter is highly improbable, making
inappropriate the requirement contained in &sect;33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph (1) to show blade containment
after a failure of the blade at the outermost retention feature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current requirements of &sect;33.94 are based on metallic blade characteristics and service history and are
not appropriate for the unusual design features of the composite fan blade found on the GE90 series turbofan engines.
The FAA has determined that a more realistic blade retention test will be achieved with a fan blade failure at the inner
flowpath diameter (complete airfoil) instead of the outermost retention feature as is currently required by &sect;33.94
paragraph (a) subparagraph (1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has also determined that the composite fan blade construction presents other factors that must be considered.
Tests and analyses must account for the effects of in-service deterioration of, manufacturing and materials variations
in, and environmental effects on the composite material. Further, tests and analyses must show that a lightning strike
on the composite fan blade will not result in a hazardous condition to the aircraft and that the engine will meet the
requirements of &sect;33.75. Therefore, these Special Conditions are proposed which define the additional requirements
which the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the
Airworthiness Standards of part 33.

Type Certification Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101, General Electric Aircraft Engines must show that the GE Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B
turbofan engines met the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those
Federal Aviation Regulations are &sect;21.21, as amended through Amendment 21&hyph;68, August 10, 1990, and part
33, as amended through Amendment 33&hyph;14, August 10, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for the GE90 series turbofan engine because of its novel or unusual design feature.
Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish
a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice and
opportunity for comment, as required by &sect;11.28 and &sect;11.29(b), and become part of the type certification
basis in accordance with &sect;21.101 paragraph (b) subparagraph (2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action affects only GE Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general
applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these engines containing this
novel or unusual design feature.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the General Electric Aircraft Engines GE90 series turbofan engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The following must be shown by tests and analyses, or other methods acceptable to the Administrator, that, in lieu
of the fan blade containment test with the fan blade failing at the point specified in &sect;33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph
(1), a fan blade containment test with the fan blade failing at the inner flowpart diameter demonstrates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the disk and fan blade retention system can withstand without failure a centrifugal load equal to two times
the maximum load which the engine could experience within approved operating limitations, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That by a procedure approved by the Administrator an operating limitation must be established which specifies
the maximum allowable number of start-stop stress cycles for the fan blade retention system. The fan blade retention
system includes the portion of the fan blade from the inner flowpath diameter inward to the blade dovetail, the blade
retention components, and the fan disk and fan blade attachment features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It must be shown that the probability of fan blade retention system failure, for any cause, during the service life
of the engine to be extremely improbable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) It must be shown by test or analysis that a lightning strike on the composite fan blade structure will not result
in a hazardous condition, and that the engine will meet the requirements of &sect;33.75. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The tests and analyses required by (a)(1) and (a)(2) of these special conditions must account for the effects of
in-service deterioration, manufacturing and materials variations, and environmental effects.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) seeks public comment on amending its regulations to establish
provisions concerning the recovery of wholesale and retail stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting
utilities under sections 205, 206, 211 and 212 of the Federal Power Act (FPA).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Wholesale stranded costs are defined as any legitimate, prudent and verifiable costs incurred by a public utility
or a transmitting utility to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer that subsequently becomes, in
whole or in part, an unbundled transmission services customer
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of that public utility or transmitting utility. Retail stranded costs are defined as any legitimate, prudent and
verifiable costs incurred by a public utility or transmitting utility to provide service to a retail franchise customer
that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, an unbundled transmission services customer
of that public utility or transmitting utility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A public utility is defined under section 201(e) of the FPA as ``any person who owns or operates facilities subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this Part (other than facilities subject to such jurisdiction solely
by reason of section 210, 211, or 212).'' A transmitting utility is defined under section 3(23) of the FPA as ``any electric
utility, qualifying cogeneration facility, qualifying small power production facility, or Federal power marketing
agency which owns or operates electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy
at wholesale.'' Not all transmitting utilities are public utilities. For instance, a municipally-owned electric
utility that owns transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale is a transmitting
utility, but is not a public utility.

An unbundled transmission services customer is one who purchases transmission as a product that is separate from
the purchase of generation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For recovery of wholesale stranded costs, the proposed rule distinguishes between stranded costs associated with
wholesale requirements contracts executed after the date the proposed rule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``new'' contracts) and stranded costs associated with wholesale requirements contracts executed on or before
that date (``existing'' contracts).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would not allow a public utility or transmitting utility to seek recovery of stranded costs associated
with ``new'' wholesale requirements contracts through transmission rates for section 205 or 211 transmission services.
Recovery of such costs will not be allowed except through explicit stranded cost provisions contained in new wholesale
requirements contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the seller under a new wholesale requirements contract is a public utility, and the new contract explicitly addresses
stranded cost recovery, the public utility may seek recovery, in accordance with the contract, under sections 205&hyph;206
of the FPA.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The public utility may not seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs through any transmission rate for section 205
or 211 transmission services. If the seller under a new wholesale requirements contract is a transmitting utility
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under section 211, but not also a public utility subject to the Commission's
section 205&hyph;206 jurisdiction,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 there will be no Commission forum for addressing wholesale stranded costs associated with the new contract. Such
utilities will not be able to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with such new contracts through
rates for transmission services ordered under section 211, and the Commission does not have jurisdiction over their
power sales contracts. Therefore, these utilities must address recovery of stranded costs through their new wholesale
requirements contracts subject to the appropriate regulatory authority approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, when a public utility files a new wholesale requirements contract that contains an explicit exit fee
amount, it may request that the Commission allow it to recover the fee, in accordance with the contract, without having
to make a subsequent section 205 filing, as long as the exit fee provision is sufficiently specific. Customers are
contractually obligated to pay such exit fees previously approved by the Commission, and such an exit fee is part of
the filed rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to stranded costs associated with ``existing'' wholesale requirements contracts, the proposed rule
provides a three-year transition period during which public utilities must attempt and non-public utilities are
encouraged to attempt to renegotiate certain existing contracts, and during which they may seek recovery of stranded
costs as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) If an existing wholesale requirements contract explicitly addresses stranded costs through an exit fee or other
stranded cost provision, no public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs associated

contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If an existing wholesale requirements contract does not explicitly address stranded costs through an exit fee
or other stranded cost provision, the parties to the contract, within a three-year transition period, must make a
good faith attempt to negotiate a stranded cost amendment to the contract. If the parties are able to negotiate an amendment,
and the selling utility under the contract is a public utility, the amendment should be filed for Commission approval
under section 205 or 206 of the FPA prior to the end of the three-year period. If the parties to the existing contract
are not able to negotiate an amendment, and the selling utility under the contract is a public utility, the public utility
may unilaterally file a proposed amendment, under section 205 or 206 of the FPA, prior to the end of the three-year period.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 If an amendment is not filed and the customer leaves the public utility's system after the end of the three-year transition
period, the Commission will deny any extra-contractual stranded cost claim in a section 205 or 206 requirements rate
proceeding arising under the contract in question.

If the selling utility is a transmitting utility that is not also a public utility, its wholesale requirements contracts
are not subject to this Commission's jurisdiction. Therefore, such transmitting utility should within the three-year
transition period take whatever steps are permitted or required under its regulatory requirements to unilaterally
propose to its regulatory authority a stranded cost provision as an amendment to its existing contract. Under this
proposal, it will not be permitted to seek stranded cost recovery from this Commission after the close of the three-year
transition period.

(c) If an existing wholesale requirements contract does not explicitly address stranded costs through an exit fee
or other stranded cost provision, and if, prior to the end of the three-year transition period, the customer gives
notice pursuant to the contract
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 that it will no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling utility but instead will purchase from
the selling utility unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 that will begin prior to the end of the three-year period, then the selling utility may seek to recover stranded costs
from that customer through jurisdictional transmission rates. This is the only circumstance in which the rule proposes
to allow wholesale stranded cost recovery through transmission rates.

(d) If a utility does seek recovery of stranded costs as permitted by the proposed rule, and the existing wholesale
requirements contract contains a notice provision, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no
legitimate expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the period provided for in the notice provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to retail stranded costs, the proposed rule adopts a strong policy preference that appropriate State
or local regulatory authorities address, in whatever manner they deem appropriate, stranded cost recovery. The
proposed rule provides alternative proposals for how the Commission will address retail stranded costs. The Commission
expresses no preference in favor of either alternative. Under the first alternative, the rule provides that if the
appropriate State or local authority does not explicitly address retail stranded costs,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 or if there is conflict among authorities within a State or among different States, the Commission will entertain
requests to recover stranded costs in section 205&hyph;206 rates for wholesale or retail transmission services
in interstate commerce,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 or in section 212 rates for wholesale transmission services ordered under section 211. Under the second alternative,
the rule provides that the Commission will not entertain any request for recovery of retail stranded costs. However,
the Commission solicits comments on whether there should be exceptions to this alternative rule.

II. Public Reporting Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule specifies filing requirements to be followed by public utilities seeking to recover stranded costs.
The information collection requirements of the proposed rule are attributable to FERC&hyph;516 ``Electric Rate
Filings''. The current total annual reporting burden for FERC&hyph;516 is 783,700 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule requires public utilities seeking to recover stranded costs to provide certain information to
the Commission. The public reporting burden for the information collection requirements contained in the proposed
rule is estimated to average 50 hours per response. This estimate includes time for reviewing the requirements of
the Commission's regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the necessary data,
completing and reviewing the collection of information, and filing the required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 public utilities. The Commission estimates that approximately ten of these utilities
will respond to the information collection annually. The respondents would be public utilities who seek to recover
stranded costs. The information will be collected on an annual basis. Accordingly, the public reporting burden is
estimated to be no more than 500 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of the Commission's collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415],

III. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, electric utilities entered into long-term contracts to make wholesale requirements sales (bundled
sales of generation and transmission) to municipal, cooperative and investor-owned utilities. Under these contracts,
utilities often committed to provide all (full requirements) or part (partial requirements) of a customer's power
needs for the contract period. Although these wholesale requirements contracts are typically for defined terms,
they often were rolled over or extended when the contract term expired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The historical supply relationship between utilities and their wholesale requirements customers, however, has
begun to undergo significant change as a result of increased competition in wholesale power generation and greater
customer access to transmission services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased competition in wholesale power generation began with the enactment of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act of 1978 (PURPA).
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 PURPA provided incentives for the development of alternative generation sources known as qualifying facilities
(QFs). In addition, state-approved competitive bidding programs paved the way for the growth of non-traditional
utility generators. Finally, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Policy Act)
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 provided regulatory exemptions to encourage a new class of wholesale power producers known as exempt wholesale generators
(EWGs).

As competition in wholesale power generation has increased, so has the ability of customers to gain access to the transmission
services necessary to reach competing suppliers. In earlier years, a few customers were able to obtain access as a
result of court proceedings, beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in Otter Tail Power Co.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 410 U.S. 366 (1973). In recent years, a growing number of public utilities voluntarily agreed to file transmission
tariffs of general applicability, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tariffs that permit transmission access for any entity that will be making sales for resale of electric energy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In most instances, access was provided in order to obtain Commission approval of a merger or consolidation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission, in many instances, conditioned its approval of certain mergers upon transmission access in order
to mitigate potential anticompetitive effects.

The trend toward greater transmission access has been accelerated by the passage of the Energy Policy Act, which substantially
expanded the Commission's authority to order transmission services. Under amended section 211 of the FPA, the Commission
may order wholesale transmission services, upon application, to any electric utility, Federal power marketing
agency, or any other person generating electric energy for sale for resale.

 Thus far, the Commission has granted requests for mandatory transmission services pursuant to section 211 in five
of the six cases it has acted on, including four proposed orders and one final order. In addition, several public utilities
have filed voluntary wholesale transmission tariffs subsequent to the passage of the Energy Policy Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the transition to a fully competitive wholesale power market, some utilities may incur stranded costs as wholesale
customers leave their systems to purchase power elsewhere. A utility may have built facilities or entered into long-term
fuel or purchased power supply contracts with the reasonable expectation, based on historical experience and the
behavior of its customer, that its wholesale requirements contract to sell electric energy to that customer would
be renewed, and that the customer would pay its proportionate share of long-term investments and other costs incurred.
If the customer is able to obtain unbundled transmission service from the utility in order to reach other power suppliers,
the utility may have ``stranded costs.'' If the utility does not have an alternative buyer for the power previously
sold to the departing wholesale requirements customer, or some other means of mitigating the stranded costs, the
costs must be recovered from either thedeparting customer or the remaining customers or borne by the utility's shareholders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes are also occurring in retail electric markets, which could also cause retail stranded costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For instance, as a result of recent action by the Massachusetts legislature, discussed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) changed from being a retail franchise customer to a wholesale transmission
customer of Massachusetts Electric Company. Another example is the California Public Utilities Commission's recent
initiation of a proceeding to consider the restructuring of California's retail electric industry to allow all consumers
to obtain direct access to competing generation service providers.

Retail stranded costs may occur when a retail franchise customer of a public utility or transmitting utility obtains
unbundled transmission service from the utility; the franchise customer may become a wholesale transmission customer
of the utility or a retail transmission customer of the utility. Retail stranded costs may also result from customer
``self-help'' actions such as customer self-generation, or a customer building its own transmission line, or a customer
relocating to another utility's service territory. These types of retail stranded costs have long been a fact of life
for utilities. This proceeding is not intended to address stranded costs resulting from customer ``self-help''
actions.

In summary, as a result of the transition to a competitive wholesale power market, we must be concerned with three ways
in which stranded costs are most likely to occur: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scenario 1: A wholesale requirements customer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a wholesale purchaser of bundled generation and transmission services) may obtain unbundled transmission services
from its existing supplier in order to reach an alternative generation supplier. It may obtain wholesale transmission
services either through a voluntary bilateral agreement or voluntary open-access tariff filed by a utility under
FPA section 205, or by obtaining a Commission order under FPA section 211; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scenario 2: A retail franchise customer (or a group of retail franchise customers) may, through State or local government
action, become a wholesale customer who obtains from its existing supplier either voluntary unbundled wholesale
transmission services under section 205 agreements or tariffs as described above, or obtains such services pursuant
to a Commission order under section 211; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scenario 3: A retail franchise customer may obtain unbundled retail transmission services from its existing supplier
in order to reach a new generation supplier, either through voluntary unbundled retail transmission services or
as a result of a State or local action requiring the existing supplier to provide such retail transmission services.

The Commission has always permitted public utilities to include reasonable cancellation provisions in power sales
contracts in order to protect themselves from stranded costs and to plan for the future needs of their systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reasonable cancellation provisions may include specified ``exit fees'' or ``termination charges'' that must be
paid by a purchaser if it terminates service prior to a contract's termination date. They may also include requirements
that customers provide sufficient prior notice of cancellation to allow utilities to avoid stranded costs.

Contracts negotiated prior to the recent movement toward increased transmission access and competitive bulk power
markets may not contain provisions requiring notice of termination and/or allocating responsibility for stranded
costs. Accordingly, the Commission has permitted public utilities to include wholesale stranded investment cost
recovery provisions in wholesale transmission rates when a public utility has filed a transmission tariff of general
applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entergy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

public utilities sought to include provisions for the recovery of wholesale stranded investment costs as part of
their proposed transmission tariff of general applicability. In that case, the Commission stated:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If Entergy has made investment decisions based on a contractual commitment or reasonable expectation at that time
that it would continue to serve these customers, it should be able to recover from them the legitimate and verifiable

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission reasoned that the existence of a transmission tariff of general applicability could increase a public
utility's risk of stranded investment far beyond what was contemplated when the public utility originally negotiated
its power supply contracts.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission further observed that public utilities may not voluntarily offer expanded transmission access if
doing so means becoming subject to an increased risk of stranded investment.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission stated that it would be appropriate for Entergy to seek to recover legitimate and verifiable
stranded investment costs through transmission rates, if such costs were associated with contracts entered into
before the date of the Commission's order. However, the Commission stated that it would not allow the Entergy utilities
to seek recovery of stranded costs associated with contracts entered into or extended after that date. The Commission
further indicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entergy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that while a public utility may seek to recover stranded costs, recovery is by no means guaranteed. The public utility
bears the heavy burden of showing, among other things, that it made relevant investment decisions based on a ``contractual
commitment or reasonable expectation'' that it would continue to serve its existing wholesale power customers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the policy objectives of Congress in enacting the electric provisions of the Energy Policy Act, the
Commission is committed to developing a competitive, open transmission access, wholesale bulk power market. Our
goal is to facilitate the development of competitively priced generation supply options, and to ensure that wholesale
purchasers of electric energy can reach alternative power suppliers and vice versa. We therefore believe it is important
at this stage of the evolution of the electric industry to address stranded costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial stability of the electric industry during the transition to a competitive wholesale generation market
will depend in large part on: (1) Whether the transition to a competitive environment, at either the wholesale or retail
level, will leave utility companies without an adequate opportunity to recover costs invested to serve customers
under less competitive circumstances; and (2) whether and how regulators address recovery of some or all of those
``stranded'' costs. While there is no universally accepted estimate of the potential magnitude of stranded costs,
some observers have suggested that stranded costs could total tens of billions of dollars, while others have suggested
$200 billion or more. These estimates are based, to a large degree, on the difference between the book value of generating
assets and their presumed market value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These estimates include both wholesale and retail stranded costs. It has been suggested that the potential amount
of retail stranded costs may be an order of magnitude larger than the potential amount of wholesale stranded costs,
given that only 10&hyph;15 percent of generating investment by investor-owned utilities is in wholesale rate base.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to concerns about the financial stability of the industry, we believe it is important to provide as much
regulatory certainty as possible, as early as possible, to buyers and sellers of electric energy and transmission,
regarding the recovery of these potentially significant costs. Buyers seeking competitive generation alternatives
need to know the costs associated with leaving their existing suppliers in order to make reasoned decisions. Likewise,
sellers need to know the extent, if any, to which they will be obligated to provide requirements service on an extra-contractual
basis so that they can plan their participation in competitive generation markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission believes it can best fulfill its regulatory responsibilities by addressing the issue
of stranded costs during the initial stages of the transition to a competitive wholesale generation market.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission therefore is proposing to establish generic policies and procedures covering the treatment of stranded
costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities.

Indeed, our experience during the regulatory restructuring of the gas pipeline industry, including the issue of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that stranded cost recovery is a transition problem. In the past, costs may have been incurred
by wholesale suppliers under an implicit regulatory ``bargain,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based on a reasonable expectation that captive customers would continue taking service beyond the term of their
contracts and that the utility would continue to plan for their needs.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 This regulatory ``bargain,'' particularly in the context of the recovery of extra-contractual stranded costs,
may not be sustainable in the face of wholesale market forces. The expectation is that market forces will ensure adequate
supply and wholesale customers will be able to contract for services from alternative suppliers.

Whereas any obligation to serve requirements customers at the wholesale level is a contractual one, the traditional
obligation to serve at the retail level arises through utility monopoly franchise rights. The traditional retail
regulatory compact has ensured the utility's financial integrity by granting it an opportunity to recover prudently
incurred costs plus a fair rate of return, in exchange for regulation by the State regulatory authority and the duty
to provide safe, reliable, reasonably priced electric service on demand. Some states have recently considered whether
the traditional franchise duty to serve all customers within the boundaries of the designated franchise area ought
to evolve and whether this duty should be modified by the State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that new generating capacity can be built and operated at costs that are less than many utilities'
current embedded generating costs. This simple fact of current economic conditions is encouraging many users to
seek access to the new lower cost sources of supply. Utilities traditionally have been obligated to serve all retail
customers within their franchise territory and all wholesale requirements customers to whom they have contractually
agreed to provide service. They have constructed or contracted for generating capacity sufficient to meet these
service obligations. If existing customers leave their current utility suppliers, the utilities may not be able
to recover all of their prudently incurred costs. In light of the utilities' status as regulated entities with retail
franchise service obligations and contractual (and perhaps extra-contractual) wholesale service commitments,
the Commission believes it is appropriate to provide a mechanism for utilities to seek to recover prudently incurred
costs that are stranded during the transition to a competitive electricity supply market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the amount of and responsibility for any costs stranded in the transition to competitive markets should
be resolved in as short a time as possible, so as not to inhibit customers from taking advantage of the competitive market
and so that sellers can restructure their marketing strategy to reflect competitive markets.

The Commission assumes that stranded costs will be dominated by generating capacity. However, we believe that it
is appropriate to consider stranded costs more broadly, including the possibility that fuel supply costs, purchased
power costs, nuclear decommissioning costs, regulatory assets and possibly other costs that the utility seller
is obligated to pay may be stranded. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission seeks public comment on what categories of costs, in addition to investment costs, should be eligible
for stranded cost recovery. The Commission also seeks comment concerning how stranded costs should be allocated

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations discussed below would allow utilities the opportunity to seek to directly assign stranded
costs to the departing wholesale and perhaps retail customers. However, an alternative policy might assign wholesale
or retail stranded costs more broadly. For example, some stranded cost proposals would require all transmission
customers (including native load which takes bundled service) to pay an access charge related to use of the transmission
system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission invites comments on the direct assignment and alternative methods of stranded cost recovery. The
Commission also invites comments on whether alternative methods, e.g., an access charge, might give customers reasonable
certainty on the scope of their stranded cost obligation more quickly than a direct assignment approach would, and
thus might expedite the transition to a more competitive wholesale market.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations are discussed in detail below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Recovery of Stranded Costs Associated With New Wholesale Power Sales Contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that future wholesale contracts should explicitly address the mutual obligations of the
seller and buyer, including the seller's obligation to continue to serve the buyer, if any, and the buyer's obligation,
if any, if it changes suppliers. Therefore, the proposed regulations regarding wholesale stranded costs encourage
the resolution of future stranded cost issues through negotiated agreement. At the same time, we are aware that many
existing contracts, entered into prior to the time that unbundled transmission access became more widely available,
may not have adequately addressed the potential for stranded costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations regarding wholesale stranded costs distinguish between new and existing wholesale requirements
contracts. New contracts are defined as contracts executed after the date that the proposed rule is published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Existing contracts are defined as contracts executed on or before the date that the proposed rule is published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would disallow extra-contractual recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with
any new requirements contract. That is, we will not allow any request for recovery unless the contract contains specific
provisions allowing stranded cost recovery when it is accepted by the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission will not allow any stranded costs associated with new requirements contracts to be recovered
through transmission rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed provisions to allow stranded cost recovery will, of course, be subject to the approval of the Commission
and must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, in the future, wholesale power suppliers and their customers must address stranded cost issues by including
appropriate notice and exit fee provisions, or any other explicit statement related to stranded cost recovery, in
their new requirements contracts. For example, sellers may wish to require adequate notice in contracts to reflect
the realities of supply planning, and may wish to include exit fees that buyers would be required to pay if the buyer
prematurely exits the system. Similarly, buyers may wish to preserve the rights to exit contracts when market conditions
warrant it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to encouraging parties to explicitly address their mutual obligations in new wholesale requirements
contracts, the Commission believes it is important to address any future regulatory obligation to serve at the wholesale
level. Competitive generation markets not only require that customers be able to freely shop for competitively priced
generation, but that sellers be free to enter new markets and to exit markets. Asymmetrical rights and obligations
that allow existing customers to leave their current suppliers consistent with their existing contractual obligations,
but that require sellers to continue to serve those customers beyond the terms of their existing contracts, would
not be efficient or fair. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that it is appropriate to impose on wholesale
requirements suppliers a regulatory obligation to continue to serve their existing requirements customers beyond
the end of the contract term. This means that a requirements customer is responsible for planning to meet its power
needs beyond the end of the contract term. It may re-contract with its existing supplier, or it may contract with new
suppliers, using its existing supplier's transmission system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission invites public comment on the extent to which there is or should be a regulatory obligation to continue
to serve wholesale requirements customers beyond the end of the contract term and the source of any such obligation.
The Commission also seeks comment concerning whether section 35.15 of the Commission's regulations, which concerns
notice of termination, should be deleted in its entirety, or only in certain circumstances (e.g., when the seller
provides transmission access on a comparable basis to the seller's own uses of its system).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Recovery of Stranded Costs Associated With Existing Wholesale Power Sales Contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because stranded costs are a transitional problem, and neglecting their recovery could delay the realization of
a fully competitive bulk power market, it is important to set a date beyond which the Commission will no longer permit
extra-contractual recovery of stranded costs that result from existing requirements contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would establish a three-year transition period during which utilities must make a good
faith effort to negotiate with their customers to add appropriate stranded cost provisions to their existing contracts
that do not already contain exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provisions. For purposes of this rule, if an existing
contract contains an exit fee provision, that provision will be deemed to be an explicit stranded cost provision which
cannot be renegotiated unless explicitly provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One purpose of setting a time limit for renegotiation is to provide an incentive for utilities and their customers
to attempt to promptly renegotiate existing requirements contracts that do not address stranded costs, so that the
contracts reflect the new realities of emerging competitive generating markets. In these situations, the Commission
expects utilities and their customers to make a good-faith effort to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. If the
parties negotiate such a provision and the seller is a public utility, the utility must file the provision as an amendment
to the existing power sales contract prior to the end of the three-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the parties to an existing wholesale requirements contract cannot negotiate a stranded cost provision, the selling
utility, if it is a public utility, may, before the end of the three-year transition period, unilaterally file under
FPA section 205 or 206 a proposed stranded cost provision as an amendment to the existing contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, as discussed in the following section, if the customer under the existing wholesale requirements
contract: (1) Gives notice pursuant to the contract, before the end of the three-year transition period, that it will
no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling utility, but instead will purchase unbundled section
205 or section 211 transmission services from the utility in order to reach a different supplier of electric energy;
and (2) the transmission services will commence prior to the end of the three-year transition period, the selling
utility may file before the end of the three-year transition period a proposal to recover stranded costs through rates
for the requested wholesale transmission services. This is the only circumstance under which the Commission will
allow utilities to seek wholesale stranded cost recovery through transmission rates.

We note that the rebuttable presumption we are proposing for contracts with notice provisions,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
infra,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 p. 30, also applies in this instance. We clarify further that, under this proposal, in order for utilities to protect
themselves against a customer exercising (inside or outside the three-year transition period) a notice of termination
provision which takes effect 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
outside
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the three-year transition period, utilities must propose to change their existing contracts 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
within
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 the three-year period. However, the rebuttable presumption will apply in this instance as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing requirements contracts are highly variable with respect to exit conditions. While some existing contracts
may have explicit exit fee or other stranded cost provisions, many others may be totally silent with respect to exit
conditions. Yet others may have notice provisions, but may not be explicit as to stranded cost recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a contract includes an explicit provision for payment of stranded costs or an exit fee, it will be assumed that the
parties fully intended the contract to cover the contingency of the buyer leaving the system. Therefore, as a matter
of policy announced here, the Commission proposes to reject stranded cost amendments to existing contracts that
already contain such provisions. If existing contracts permit renegotiation of existing stranded cost provisions,
the parties may renegotiate in accordance with the contract. However, if existing contracts prohibit stranded cost
recovery, or explicitly prohibit renegotiation of an existing stranded cost or exit fee provision, or prohibit renegotiation
until after the three-year period has expired, the parties will not be required to renegotiate within the three-year
period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission invites comments on what other types of contractual provisions, if any, might demonstrate a sufficient
``meeting of the minds'' between parties so that renegotiation should be barred. The Commission also solicits comments
on whether to apply these rules regarding existing contracts only to contracts between unaffiliated entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a contract does not include an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, but does contain a notice provision,
there will be a rebuttable presumption that the selling utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve
the customer beyond the period provided for in the notice provision. This presumption will apply when public utilities
propose unilateral amendments to requirements contracts, as described above, as well as when public utilities or
transmitting utilities seek stranded cost recovery through transmission rates, as described above. The Commission
solicits comment on whether the rebuttable presumption should also be applied to any contract entered into after
the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act, even though such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit
stranded cost provision, or a notice provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For existing contracts that do not contain specific exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provisions, the Commission
proposes to require parties to make a good faith attempt at renegotiation. This is because many of these contracts
were negotiated twenty years ago, or more, when the parties likely did not foresee the advent of competition in wholesale
generation markets and the ability of transmission-dependent utilities to gain access to their supplier's transmission
system to reach other sellers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that new requirements contracts and renegotiated existing requirements contracts may
contain contractual features that have heretofore not been included in requirements contracts. Buyers and sellers
will seek to protect themselves from contingencies made more likely as a result of increased competition in power
markets. The Commission will not impose a preconceived notion of what those contract provisions should look like,
and does not necessarily believe that a ``one size fits all'' approach is appropriate.

The Commission believes that a failure to permit public utilities to address stranded costs through negotiation
or unilateral rate changes could harm the public interest in at least two ways. First, the inability to seek recovery
of stranded costs could impair the financial ability of a utility to continue to provide reliable service. This will
depend on the magnitude of stranded costs and the prospect or lack thereof for recovering such costs from ratepayers.
The prospect of not recovering from ratepayers significant amounts of stranded costs could seriously erode a utility's
access to capital markets, or could drive the utility's cost of capital to unprecedented levels. This high cost of
capital could precipitate other customers leaving the system which, in turn, could cause others to leave. Such a spiral
could be difficult to stop once begun. Second, if some customers are permitted to leave their suppliers without paying
for stranded costs, this may cause an excessive burden on the remaining customers who for whatever reason cannot leave
and therefore may have to bear those costs. For these reasons, our preliminary view is that it is in the public interest
to permit public utilities with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mobile-Sierra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contracts a limited opportunity to unilaterally propose contract changes to address stranded costs, if those contracts

 contracts that do not explicitly address stranded costs may also file complaints under section 206 of the FPA, within

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We clarify that if a public utility unilaterally files a proposed stranded cost amendment under either section 205
or 206, this does not necessarily mean that the Commission ultimately will find it appropriate to allow any amendment.
The same is true for customer complaints under section 206. In addition, the Commission intends to allow the customer
to the contract to present any other proposed stranded cost amendment which it believes reasonable.

need to be amended.

The Commission invites public comment on the proposal to establish a transition period during which utilities may
renegotiate their existing contracts. The Commission also invites public comment on whether public utilities or
customers with Mobile-Sierra contracts should be able to make unilateral filings or file complaints. The Commission
also invites comments on whether the Commission should make a Mobile-Sierra public interest finding based on company-specific
findings instead of generic industry-wide findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is uncertain how long the proposed transition period should be. On the one hand, the renegotiation
process is likely to be time-consuming, since difficult issues are at stake and some utilities have multiple contracts
and may therefore be engaged in negotiations with a number of parties at the same time. On the other hand, we do not want
to extend the transition period more than is necessary, since the uncertainty concerning stranded cost recovery
may inhibit wholesale customers from pursuing more efficient or cheaper supply alternatives. The Commission's
preliminary view is that a transition period of three years strikes an appropriate balance. However, the Commission
invites comment on the appropriate length of the proposed transition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission requests that utility commenters include in their comments an estimate of the number of requirements
contracts that they would seek to renegotiate to address stranded cost issues. How many of these contracts are silent
on this question? How many have notice provisions, and of what duration? The Commission requests that responding
utilities estimate the amount of stranded costs associated with such contracts, the relationship of the estimated
stranded costs to the utility's total costs or revenues, and the potential cost shift to remaining customers.

3. Recovery of Wholesale Stranded Costs in Wholesale Transmission Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission has previously authorized provisions that permit public utilities to seek recovery of stranded costs
in wholesale transmission rates in the context of utilities filing transmission tariffs of general applicability,
e.g., Entergy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the prior section, during the transition period the proposed regulations would permit utilities
to file rates for transmission services that include stranded costs associated with existing wholesale requirements
contracts, but only if: (1) the wholesale requirements customer gives notice pursuant to the contract, prior to the
end of the three-year transition period, that it will no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling
utility, but instead will purchase unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services from the utility in
order to reach a different supplier of electric energy; and (2) the transmission services will begin prior to the end
of the three-year transition period. After the transition period, public utilities and transmitting utilities
would no longer be permitted to recover wholesale stranded costs in rates for transmission services under section
205 or 211 of the FPA.

Filings to recover stranded costs in transmission rates during the transition period will be permitted regardless
of whether the service is voluntarily provided (under section 205 of the FPA pursuant to an open-access tariff, a tariff
of general applicability or an individual contract) or mandated under section 211 of the FPA. However, the Commission
invites public comment on the issue of whether stranded cost recovery should be different depending on whether transmission
service is under section 205 or 211.

The Commission does not in this proposed rulemaking address who will bear the stranded costs caused by a departing
customer if the Commission finds that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve that customer.
Under the proposed rule, the costs cannot be recovered from the departing customer through transmission rates for
that customer or through a unilateral exit fee amendment in that customer's power sales contract. We anticipate that
in such a case a public utility will seek in subsequent requirements rate cases to have the costs reallocated among
the remaining customers on its system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that stranded costs can occur when a customer fails to renew its requirements contract
and, instead of obtaining unbundled transmission services from its former requirements supplier, obtains unbundled
transmission services from another utility. We anticipate that in such a case any prudent costs that are stranded
as a result of the customer's departure would be reallocated to remaining customers in the utility's next requirements
rate case. This results in the departing customer bearing none of the costs which it may have caused to be stranded.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

4. Filing Requirements for Wholesale Stranded Cost Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission proposes to amend Part 35, Chapter I, Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to establish filing requirements for public utilities (as defined in FPA section 201(e)) and transmitting utilities
(as defined in FPA section 3(23)) that seek stranded cost recovery. Our view is that the only circumstance in which
transmitting utilities that are not also public utilities may seek stranded cost recovery from this Commission is
through rates for transmission services under FPA sections 211 and 212. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations define ``wholesale stranded cost'' as ``any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred
by a public utility or transmitting utility to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer that subsequently
becomes, in whole or in part, an unbundled transmission customer of such public utility or transmitting utility.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In theory, a utility's stranded costs could include transmission and distribution facilities. However, when a customer
switches from being a requirements customer and becomes a transmission service-only customer, the public utility
or transmitting utility probably will continue to provide roughly equivalent amounts of transmission services
and, if relevant, distribution services. Thus, the Commission's preliminary view is that stranded costs will primarily
be related to power production, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 generation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would permit a public utility or transmitting utility to seek recovery of wholesale stranded
costs as follows. First, for stranded costs associated with new wholesale requirements contracts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 any wholesale requirements contract executed after the date that this order is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the proposed regulations would allow recovery of stranded costs only if the contract explicitly provides for recovery
of stranded costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, for existing wholesale requirements contracts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 any wholesale requirements contract executed on or before the date that this order is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the proposed regulations would specify that a utility may not recover stranded costs associated with such contract
if recovery is explicitly prohibited by the contract (including associated settlements) or by any power sales or
transmission tariff on file with the Commission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, for existing wholesale requirements contracts that do not address stranded costs through exit fee or other
explicit stranded cost provisions, the proposed rule would allow a public utility to seek recovery of stranded costs
only if: (1) The existing contract contains a specific provision allowing recovery of stranded costs; or (2) the parties
to the existing contract renegotiate the contract in accordance with this rule and file an amendment dealing with
stranded costs prior to the expiration of the three-year transition period; or (3) if the parties to the existing contract
do not renegotiate a stranded cost amendment, the selling utility unilaterally files, no later than the end of the
transition period, a proposed stranded cost amendment to the parties' existing contract; or (4) if the parties to
the existing contract do not renegotiate an amendment, the public utility files a request to recover stranded costs
in its transmission rates under FPA sections 205&hyph;206, or 211&hyph;212, under the limited circumstance described
in section III.C.(3) herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, if the selling utility under an existing wholesale requirements contract is a transmitting utility but not
also a public utility, and the contract does not address stranded costs through an explicit exit fee or other stranded
cost provision, the transmitting utility may file a request to recover stranded costs in transmission rates under
FPA sections 211&hyph;212, as described in section III.C.(3) herein.

 and subsequent cases, the Commission provided guidance concerning the evidentiary demonstration that utilities
must make to recover stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates. The Commission believes that this demonstration
is still relevant and appropriate. We therefore propose to apply it to any proposal for extra-contractual recovery
in accordance with this proposed rule.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This would include public utilities who unilaterally seek to amend an existing wholesale requirements contract
as described herein and public utilities and transmitting utilities that seek to recover stranded costs through
transmission rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is the proposed demonstration that a public utility or transmitting utility must satisfy in order to
recover stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, and that a public utility must satisfy if it proposes a unilateral
amendment to its wholesale requirements contract: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A utility must show that it incurred stranded costs based on an expectation that was reasonable when the costs were
incurred that the applicable contract would be extended; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A utility must show that the stranded costs it incurred are not more than the customer would have contributed to
the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A utility must show that it has taken and will take reasonable and prudent measures to mitigate stranded costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of whether a utility had a reasonable expectation of continuing to serve a customer is a factual matter
that will depend on the evidence produced in each case. Whether the utility's expectation was reasonable will depend
on the circumstances at the time that stranded costs were incurred, including, for instance, whether the customer
at that time had access to alternative suppliers. A utility also must offer evidence that its expectation was based
on the actual conduct or course of dealing of the two parties (the utility and its customer). However, the Commission
does not believe it is in the public interest to have prolonged litigation on these issues. Therefore, we will provide
general guidance as to the type of evidence that would tend to prove or disprove the existence of a reasonable expectation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a public utility seeks to include certain types of construction-work-in-progress (CWIP) in rate base for a particular
customer, the utility must use forward-looking cost allocators (estimates of the customer's cost responsibility
when the facility will be in service).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
49
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the fact that a utility has recovered CWIP from a particular customer (without the customer's objection)
may provide persuasive evidence of a reasonable expectation that it would continue to serve that customer for a certain
term. The Commission is aware, however, that few utilities have taken advantage of the CWIP rule, perhaps because
few utilities have been undertaking major construction projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A reasonable expectation that a contract would be extended could also be shown by communications between supplier
and customer concerning system planning. For example, if a buyer has indicated that the seller should continue to
include the buyer's load in the seller's resource planning beyond the contract term or has indicated to the seller
that it has not taken active steps to secure a new supplier, the seller may have legitimately had a reasonable expectation
of continuing the service, particularly if the parties have routinely extended the contract in the past. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, a utility very likely would have no reasonable expectation that a contract would be extended if the
contract includes a notice of cancellation provision. Therefore, there will be a rebuttable presumption that if
a contract contains a notice provision, the utility had no reasonable expectation of serving the customer beyond
the period provided for in the notice provision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission invites comments on all aspects of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a reasonable expectation.
We specifically request comments on our proposal that any notice provision creates a rebuttable presumption of no
reasonable expectation, or whether we should adopt a minimum notice period that would provide a presumption that
the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to provide service beyond the notice period, e.g., a five-year
notice period.

The second element described above concerns reasonable compensation for stranded costs. We request comments on
what is reasonable compensation:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the annual amount of stranded costs that a former requirements
customer must pay to be no more than what the customer would have contributed to the utility's capital (customer revenues
minus variable costs), or would some alternative concept be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the future time period over which a customer's liability for
stranded costs would be determined? That is, the present value of the customer's liability could be the discounted
value of an annual amount for a limited time period. This total amount could be paid in a lump sum or over any mutually
agreeable period. The limited time period over which the customer's liability is determined could be called the reasonable
compensation period. If so: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Would the Commission apply the reasonable compensation period to assess the reasonableness of an exit fee in a
revised requirements contract as well as a transmission surcharge? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) How long should such a time period be, e.g., five years or ten years or some other period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When should such a period begin, e.g., if five years is a reasonable time over which a customer is liable for stranded
costs, does the five-year period begin when the Commission adopts a final rule or when the utility files for stranded
cost recovery in the future? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Should the length of a reasonable compensation period be based on what would constitute a reasonable notice period
in requirements contracts or would some other concept be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Establishing a reasonable compensation period effectively would also establish a future date beyond which requirements
customers would no longer have any liability for stranded costs, either as an exit fee in revised requirements contracts
or as a surcharge on transmission rates. Would this be appropriate? In responding, commenters should keep in mind
that the concept of a reasonable time period for computing stranded cost liability is independent of the proposed
three-year recontracting period for which the Commission is also requesting separate comments.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third element described above concerns mitigation measures. Adequate mitigation measures might include: (1)
Evidence that the utility has tried to market the asset or assets, market the generating capacity, reconfigure or
delay investment in or purchase of new generating capacity, or reform fuel supply contracts that form the basis for
the stranded costs charge, and that such measures to mitigate stranded costs will continue for the entire period for
which the stranded costs charge will be paid; or (2) the utility has given the customer the option to market the generating
capacity or supply of fuel or purchased power that forms the basis for the stranded costs charge in order to afford the
customer an opportunity to lower its stranded costs charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects the utility to use its best efforts to market its existing generating capacity as one way of
mitigating costs. The Commission would expect to require revenues generated from sales of the capacity to be credited
against the stranded costs to be recovered through transmission rates to the departing customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission invites comment on the requirement that a utility must demonstrate reasonable measures to mitigate
stranded costs and what such measures may include. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also invites comment on how to determine the amount of stranded costs that the departing customer may
be liable to pay.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission said that stranded costs could be no more than the revenues the departing customer would pay to the
seller over the life of the contract. However, given that parties to requirements contracts are encouraged to include
exit conditions (including notice provisions) in new contracts and renegotiated existing requirements contracts,
it can be argued that stranded cost recovery should be capped at the revenues that the departing customer would pay
after having given notice to the seller that it wishes to end all or some portion of its purchase. The problem then becomes
what is a reasonable notice period, given the needs of sellers to adequately plan supply and the ability of sellers
to find alternative buyers for power not taken by existing buyers. This issue pertains not only to determining stranded
cost recovery in transmission rates but also to determining appropriate stranded cost provisions in new requirements
contracts.

As discussed earlier, there are two general ways in which retail stranded costs are likely to occur:

 (1) A retail franchise customer may, through State or local government action, become a wholesale customer who can
then obtain unbundled transmission services in order to reach a new power supplier;
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 (2) a retail franchise customer may obtain voluntary unbundled retail transmission services from its existing power
supplier in order to reach a new power supplier, or there may be a State or local action that results in the existing supplier
providing such retail transmission services.

In the first example (a retail franchise customer becomes an unbundled wholesale power and transmission customer),
the Commission clearly has exclusive jurisdiction under sections 201, 205 and 206, or section 212 of the FPA, over
the rate for the wholesale interstate transmission services
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 used by the new wholesale entity in order to reach its new generation supplier. In the second example, in which a retail
franchise customer becomes a retail unbundled transmission customer of its former franchise utility, and a retail
power customer of another utility, we conclude that we also have exclusive jurisdiction over the rates, terms and
conditions for the retail interstate transmission services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of transmission in interstate commerce derives
from Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce under the United States Constitution
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 and the FPA. When Congress enacted the FPA, it gave the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over the rates, terms and
conditions of transmission in interstate commerce by public utilities. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution
provides that federal laws enacted pursuant to the powers delegated to the federal government by the United States
Constitution are the supreme law of the land.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, to the extent that retail wheeling involves transmission in interstate commerce by public utilities,
the rates, terms and conditions of such service are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission, and the
rates for such service must be filed with the Commission.

While the provisions of section 201 reserving certain regulatory authority to the States have been interpreted narrowly,
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 the courts have construed ``in interstate commerce'' broadly. The term does not turn on whether the contract path
for a particular power or transmission sale crosses state lines, but rather follows the physical flow of electricity.
Because of the highly integrated nature of the electric system, this results in most transmission of electric energy
being ``in interstate commerce.''

It is impossible for us to conclude that this definition [of transmission in interstate commerce] means less than

In all of the above cases, the Court's decisions turned on whether energy flowed in interstate commerce as a technical
matter. The decisions did not turn on whether the energy flowing in interstate commerce was being sold for resale or
was being sold to an end user. However, under FPA section 201(b), the Commission does not have jurisdiction over facilities
used in local distribution. In

``carry no energy except extra-state energy.'' 324 U.S. at 531. The Court rejected the argument that transmission
and local distribution facilities could be distinguished by the proportion or amount of interstate energy that they
carried:

While the precise demarcation between transmission and local distribution remains unclear, and the Commission
has not yet definitively addressed this issue, there is nothing in the statute, its legislative history, or the case
law to indicate that the Commission's jurisdiction over rates, terms and conditions of transmission in interstate
commerce extends only to wholesale transmission and not retail transmission.

(ii) Treatment of Retail Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Commission has jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of both wholesale and retail transmission
services in interstate commerce by public utilities, arguably it may allow retail stranded cost recovery in rates
for either wholesale or retail transmission services. There nevertheless may be important legal or policy reasons
to exclude retail stranded costs from transmission rates. As noted earlier, however, the Commission has been presented
only with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek recovery in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
wholesale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transmission rates of stranded investment costs incurred to serve former retail customers (Scenario 2, section
III.A.). The Commission has not been presented with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek
recovery in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
retail 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transmission rates of stranded costs incurred to serve the customer when it was a retail customer (Scenario 3, section
III.A.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we believe the Commission has the authority to address retail stranded costs through its jurisdiction over
the rates, terms and conditions of interstate transmission services used by retail or newly-created wholesale customers,
we also believe that the recovery of the costs of transition to competition at the retail level is a matter that should
be addressed by State authorities. This is because retail stranded costs will occur primarily as a result of State
and local decisionmaking regarding retail franchise areas and the creation of new wholesale entities. In particular,
the Commission believes it is incumbent upon states to deal with the consequences of stranded costs that occur as a
result of retail wheeling. Our strong policy preference is that states explicitly address the issue. State and local
decisionmakers have a first-hand understanding of the regulatory bargain with respect to stranded costs incurred
to serve retail customers, and they are familiar with the planning, investment and purchase activities of the utilities
they regulate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of procedural mechanisms which we believe States can use to address retail stranded costs. For example,
a State that permits a retail franchise customer to become a wholesale entity may consider whether to impose an exit
fee prior to, or as a condition of, creating the wholesale entity. Similarly, a State may consider whether to require
payment of an exit fee prior to a franchise customer being permitted to obtain unbundled retail wheeling. In situations
in which local distribution facilities are used by a retail wheeling customer, the State may consider whether to allow
recovery of stranded costs through rates for local distribution services. If a State decides not to impose exit fees,
or a surcharge through distribution rates, it may consider whether to allow recovery of stranded costs from remaining
customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In situations in which a new wholesale entity obtains ownership or control of a franchise utility's transmission
or distribution facilities, it is possible that State condemnation proceedings will provide a forum for a utility
to seek recovery of any stranded costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What types of payments, if any, do new municipal utilities make to prior service providers? Do these reimbursements
allow for recovery of stranded generation costs? Is there variation among the States as to the legal ability of local
entities to municipalize? Is there variation among the States as to the payments made by new municipal utilities to
previous suppliers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may, of course, be other mechanisms which States can use to determine whether to allow stranded cost recovery,
and from whom to allow recovery. The Commission solicits comments on what other mechanisms might be used, and whether
these mechanisms are adequate to deal with retail stranded costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While our strong preference is for States to address retail stranded costs in whatever way they deem appropriate,
we are willing to explore whether there are circumstances under which this Commission should consider claims for
recovery of retail stranded costs. We will therefore present two proposed alternatives regarding retail stranded
costs, and seek comment on both. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, as noted above, we express no preference in favor of either alternative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the first alternative, the proposed rule provides that if in a specific circumstance an appropriate State authority
explicitly considers and deals with retail stranded costs and there is no conflict within or among State regulatory
bodies regarding a State's disposition of the issue, this Commission will not entertain a request for retail stranded
cost recovery. However, in the absence of a clear expression by an appropriate State authority that it has dealt with
the issue, or in the event of a conflict between States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
60
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or among State officials within a single state, the Commission proposes to entertain requests to recover retail stranded
costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, a conflict between States could result if State A's legislature allows a former retail customer to become
a wholesale entity and the wholesale entity obtains transmission services so that it now takes only one half of its
100 MW load from its current utility supplier, which is a multistate utility. As a result of State A's action, the utility
has retail stranded costs for 50 MW of generation. State A's commission allocates the utility's retail costs so that
State A's retail customers are responsible for only one half of the stranded costs. State B's commission, the other
State in which the utility operates, allocates the utility's retail costs so that none of the retail stranded costs
are allocated to State B's retail customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the second alternative, the proposed rule provides that the Commission will not entertain any request for recovery
of retail stranded costs. Under this proposal, State or local authorities will be the only forum for addressing the
issue. The aforementioned preference for States to address retail stranded costs in whatever way they deem appropriate,
the need for regulatory certainty, and the States' knowledge and expertise regarding utility planning, investment
and purchase activities arguably favors the second alterative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
However, we solicit comment on whether there should be limited exceptions to the second alternative rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to both alternatives, the Commission solicits comments on the following questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there circumstances under which it is not necessarily appropriate to defer to the States (e.g., where one State
takes an action regarding retail stranded costs which has adverse consequences for another State)? Are there circumstances
under which a State may not have an adequate mechanism for addressing retail stranded costs, and may want the Commission
to provide a forum? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not explicitly address stranded costs resulting from an action that allows retail customers to purchase
from a supplier other than the franchised utility, should this Commission entertain requests from the utilities
left with the stranded costs? Beyond silence from the State, are there other factors that the Commission should consider
before accepting requests for retail stranded cost recovery? Specifically, would financial health and possible
adverse impacts on reliability be sufficient reason for Federal action? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission further solicits comments on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for retail transmission service?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does FPA section 212 give the Commission legal authority to allow recovery of retail stranded costs in rates for
wholesale transmission services under FPA section 211? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are there legal or policy reasons why in Scenario 2 (p. 15), the Commission should entertain requests for recovery
of retail stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, but should not entertain requests for recovery of retail
stranded costs in retail transmission rates in Scenario 3 (section III.A.)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission determines that it will entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs through rates
for wholesale or retail transmission in interstate commerce, the Commission proposes not to apply the ``reasonable
expectation'' test used for wholesale stranded costs. To apply such a test would require a hearing on whether the franchise
utility had a reasonable expectation, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of having its franchise renewed, of municipalization occurring, or of a section 212(h) non-sham wholesale entity
being created by the State or local authority. No such test appears warranted because, in general, there is at the retail
level an obligation to serve which is much stronger than any contractual obligation to serve at the wholesale level.
The regulatory compact that has governed provision of retail service includes an implicit obligation to purchase
concomitant with the utility's obligation to serve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission requests comments on whether these assumptions are correct, i.e., is the reasonable expectation
test inapplicable to retail stranded costs? Are there situations, for instance, in which utilities could have expected
municipalization to occur based on an established course of dealing? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these assumptions, if the Commission determines that it will entertain requests for retail stranded costs,
the proposed regulations for retail stranded costs would require only a showing of the dollar amounts that have been
stranded as a result of the retail customer no longer taking bundled service from the franchise utility's system.
In essence, this results in direct assignment of retail stranded costs to the former franchise customer. The Commission
requests comments on how to determine retail stranded costs as a general matter. Is there a future time when a retail
customer's action of leaving a local franchise no longer has any adverse economic consequences on the franchise utility?
If so, what is an appropriate way to make such a determination?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires that rulemakings contain either a description and analysis of the effect the proposed rule will have on small
entities or a certification that the rule will not have a substantial economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities. Because the entities that would be required to comply with the proposed rule are public utilities and transmitting
utilities that do not fall within the RFA's definition of small entities,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
62
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small

V. Environmental Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commission regulations require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement
for any Commission action that may have a significant effect on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
63
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from this requirement as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgation of a rule that involves electric rate filings submitted
by public utilities under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
65
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule specifies the standards and procedures that public utilities must follow in a rate filing proceeding
in order to seek recovery of stranded costs. Accordingly, no environmental consideration of the proposed rule is
necessary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs if such recovery is explicitly
prohibited by a contract or settlement agreement, or by any power sales or transmission rate schedule or tariff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract containing an exit fee
or other explicit stranded cost provision, and the seller under the contract is a public utility, the public utility
may seek recovery of such costs, in accordance with the contract, through rates for electric energy under sections
205&hyph;206 of the FPA. The public utility may not seek recovery of such costs through any transmission rate for section
205 or 211 transmission services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract, and the seller under
the contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, the transmitting utility may not seek an order
from the Commission allowing recovery of such costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller
under such contract is a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded
cost provision, the parties to the contract must make a good faith attempt to negotiate an explicit stranded cost amendment
to the contract by [a date three years from the date a final rule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
]. If the parties negotiate a proposed amendment, the public utility seller under the contract must file the proposed
amendment under section 205 or 206 of the FPA no later than [the end of the three-year period]. If the parties do not negotiate
an explicit stranded cost amendment, the public utility seller may unilaterally file a proposed stranded cost amendment
no later than [the end of the three-year transition period]. In such case, the customer may propose an alternate amendment.
The filing or proposal of such amendment(s) will not affect any contractual rights the customer may have to continue
taking service beyond [the end of the three-year transition period]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If a customer under an existing wholesale requirements contract, prior to [the end of the three-year period],
gives notice pursuant to the contract that it will no longer purchase requirements service under the contract but
will purchase unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services from the selling utility in order to reach
a different supplier of electric energy, and the transmission services will commence prior to [the end of the transition
period], a public utility or transmitting utility may file by [the end of the transition period] a proposal to recover
stranded costs in rates for the wholesale transmission services.

 If a public utility or transmitting utility seeks recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with an existing
contract, as permitted in paragraph(c)(1) of this section, and the existing contract contains a notice provision,
there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer
beyond the term of the notice provision.

retail transmission services only if: (i) an appropriate State or local regulatory body has not explicitly considered
and addressed retail stranded costs; or (ii) an appropriate State or local regulatory body has explicitly addressed
stranded costs, but there is a conflict within or among State regulatory bodies regarding the State or local authority's
disposition of the issue.

For the ease of those submitting comments, the following is a compendium of the questions contained in the proposed
rule:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Index of Questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. What categories of costs, in addition to investment costs, should be eligible for stranded cost recovery? How should
stranded costs be allocated to specific customers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission invites comments on the direct assignment and alternative methods of stranded cost recovery. Would
alternative methods, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, an access charge, give customers reasonable certainty on the scope of their stranded cost obligation more quickly
than a direct assignment approach would, and thus expedite the transition to a more competitive wholesale market?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To what extent is there or should there be a regulatory obligation to continue to serve requirements customers beyond
the end of the contract term and the source of any such obligation? Should section 35.15 of the Commission's regulations,
which concerns notice of termination, be deleted in its entirety, or only in certain circumstances (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, when the seller provides transmission access on a comparable basis to the seller's own uses of its system)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What types of contractual provisions (in addition to notice provisions), if any, might demonstrate a sufficient
``meeting of the minds'' between parties so that renegotiation of existing contracts should be barred? Should the
proposed rules regarding existing contracts apply only to contracts between unaffiliated entities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should the rebuttable presumption which would apply to contracts containing notice provisions also be applied
to any contract entered into after the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act, even though such contract does not
contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, or a notice provision? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Should there be a transition period during which utilities may renegotiate their existing contracts? Should utilities
or customers with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Mobile-Sierra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 contracts be able to make unilateral filings or file complaints? Should the Commission make a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Mobile-Sierra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 public interest finding based on company-specific findings instead of generic industry-wide findings? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. What is the appropriate length for a transition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

8. The Commission requests that utility commenters include in their comments an estimate of the number of power sales
contracts that they would seek to renegotiate to address stranded cost issues. How many of these contracts are silent
on this question? How many have notice provisions, and of what duration? The Commission requests that responding
utilities estimate the amount of stranded costs associated with such contracts, the relationship of the estimated
stranded costs to the utility's total costs or revenues, and the potential cost shift to remaining customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Should the limitations on recovery of stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates apply to all utilities, whether
or not they currently have on file transmission tariffs containing stranded cost provisions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Should stranded cost recovery be different depending on whether transmission service is under section 205 or
211? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. In lieu of direct assignment, should utilities be able to seek a general surcharge to all of their transmission
customers to cover the costs stranded by a departing customer? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Commission recognizes that stranded costs can occur when a customer fails to renew its requirements contract
and, instead of obtaining unbundled transmission service from its former requirements supplier, obtains unbundled
transmission service from another utility. We anticipate that in such a case any prudent costs that are stranded as
a result of the customer's departure would be reallocated to remaining customers in the utility's next requirements
rate case. This results in the departing customer bearing none of the costs which it may have caused to be stranded.
How should the Commission deal with such costs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Commission invites comments on all aspects of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a reasonable expectation
of continuing to serve a customer beyond the period provided for in a notice provision. Should there be a rebuttable
presumption that the existence of a notice provision means the utility had no reasonable expectation of serving the
customer beyond the end of that notice period? Should we adopt a minimum notice period that would provide a presumption
that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to provide service beyond the notice period, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a five-year notice period? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. In seeking stranded cost recovery, a utility must show that the stranded costs it incurred are not more than the
customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the
utility. This required evidentiary demonstration concerns the reasonable compensation for stranded costs. We
request comments on what is reasonable compensation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the annual amount of stranded costs that a power customer must
pay to be no more than what the customer would have contributed to the utility's capital (customer revenues minus variable
costs), or would some alternative concept be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the future time period over which a customer's liability for
stranded costs would be determined? That is, the present value of the customer's liability could be the discounted
value of an annual amount for a limited time period. This total amount could be paid in a lump sum or over any mutually
agreeable period. The limited time period over which the customer's liability is determined could be called the reasonable
compensation period. If so: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would the Commission apply the reasonable compensation period to assess the reasonableness of an exit fee in a
revised power contract as well as a transmission surcharge? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) How long should such a time period be, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 five years or ten years or some other period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When should such a period begin, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 if five years is a reasonable time over which a customer is liable for stranded costs, does the five-year period begin
when the Commission adopts a final rule or when the utility files for stranded cost recovery in the future? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Should the length of a reasonable compensation period be based on what would constitute a reasonable notice period
in power contracts or would some other concept be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Establishing a reasonable compensation period effectively would also establish a future date beyond which existing
power customers would no longer have any liability for stranded costs, either as an exit fee in revised power contracts
or as a surcharge on transmission rates. Would this be appropriate? In responding, commenters should keep in mind
that the concept of a reasonable time period for computing stranded cost liability is independent of the proposed
three year recontracting period for which the Commission is also requesting separate comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Should the Commission require that a public utility demonstrate reasonable measures to mitigate stranded costs?
What should such measures include? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. How should the Commission determine the amount of stranded costs that the departing customer may be liable to pay?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. What are reasonable notice periods for requirements contracts? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. What types of payments, if any, do new municipal utilities make to prior service providers? Do these reimbursements
allow for recovery of stranded generation costs? Is there variation among the States as to the legal ability of local
entities to municipalize? Is there variation among the States as to the payments made by new municipal utilities to
previous suppliers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. What mechanisms can States use to allow retail stranded cost recovery? Are these mechanisms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
adequate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to deal with retail stranded costs?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
20. The Commission solicits comments on the two proposed alternatives regarding retail stranded costs. The first
proposed alternative provides that if in a specific circumstance an appropriate State authority explicitly considers
and deals with retail stranded costs and there is no conflict within or among State regulatory bodies regarding a State's
disposition of the issue, this Commission will not entertain a request for retail stranded cost recovery. However,
in the absence of a clear expression by an appropriate State authority that it has dealt with the issue, or in the event
of a conflict between States or among State officials within a single State, the Commission proposes to entertain
requests to recover retail stranded costs. Is this proposal reasonable? Is it preferable to the second alternative
proposal? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Should there be limited exceptions to the second alternative rule? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. As to both alternatives, the Commission further solicits comments on the following questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there circumstances under which it is not necessarily appropriate to defer to the States (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
where one State takes an action regarding retail stranded costs which has adverse consequences for another State)?
Are there circumstances under which a State may not have an adequate mechanism for addressing retail stranded costs,
and may want the Commission to provide a forum? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State does not explicitly address stranded costs resulting from an action that allows retail customers to purchase
from a supplier other than the franchised utility, should this Commission entertain requests from the utilities
left with the stranded costs? Beyond silence from the State, are there other factors that the Commission should consider
before accepting requests for retail stranded cost recovery? Specifically, would financial health and possible
adverse impacts on reliability be sufficient reason for Federal action? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission further solicits comments on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for retail transmission service?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does FPA section 212 give the Commission legal authority to allow recovery of retail stranded costs in rates for
wholesale transmission services under FPA section 211? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are there legal or policy reasons why in Scenario 2, the Commission should entertain requests for recovery of retail
stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, but should not entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded
costs in retail transmission rates in Scenario 3? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. Are the Commission's assumptions concerning the reasonable expectations of utilities with respect to retail
customers correct, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
is the reasonable expectation test inapplicable to retail stranded costs? Are there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations, for instance, in which utilities could have expected municipalization to occur based on an established
course of dealing? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. The Commission requests comments on how to determine retail stranded costs as a general matter. Is there a future
time when a retail customer's action of leaving a local franchise no longer has any adverse economic consequences
on the franchise utility? If so, what is an appropriate way to make such a determination?

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Maryland regulatory program (hereinafter the ``Maryland
program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment establishes
minimum engineering design standards to provide the 1.3 minimum static safety factor for a normal pool with steady
state seepage conditions in lieu of engineering tests for small impoundments that are not a safety hazard. The amendment
will provide an optional approach to determine the 1.3 minimum static factor for small, non-hazardous impoundments
not built of or impounding coal mine waste. The amendment is intended to revise the Maryland program to be consistent
with the corresponding Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Maryland Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On February 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Maryland program. Background information on the
Maryland program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the February 18, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 7214). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR
920.15 and 920.16.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Description of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 22, 1993, OSM published a final rule (58 FR 33910) for Maryland program amendment (Administrative Record Numbers
MD&hyph;549.00 and MD&hyph;539.16) concerning hydrologic balance, ponds and sediment control measures, and civil
penalties. The Director approved the program amendment except for COMAR 08.09.13.24H(3)(c). The intent of proposed
08.09.13.24H(3)(c) was to establish engineering design standards in lieu of engineering tests to ensure a 1.3 minimum
safety factor for small non-hazardous impoundments that are not constructed with or impound coal mine waste and not
subject to the requirements of 30 CFR 77.216(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director found that COMAR 08.13.09.24H(3)(c) was deficient in two areas. First, the soil strength values used
in the stability analysis defined dry density and optimum moisture content values associated with them but did not
specify the moisture content of the fill material necessary to achieve the required density through compaction.
Secondly, the phreatic surface defined in the analysis did not reflect normal pool conditions under a ``worst case''
scenario.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letters dated May 16, 1994, and June 23, 1994 (Administrative Record Number MD&hyph;569.00), Maryland submitted
a program amendment to satisfy OSM's concerns delineated in the June 22, 1993, final rule. The amendment adds COMAR
08.13.09.24h(1)(q) requiring the material used in the construction of the impoundment to have sufficient moisture
content to achieve proper compaction. The amendment also revises the stability analysis to support COMAR 08.13.09.24H(3)(c)
to represent normal pool conditions under a worst case scenario.

III. Public Comment Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Maryland program.

This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 26, 1994, the sponsor, Mr. Ronald Feldstein, Westhampton Beach, NY requested that a fireworks display be permitted
in the port of Westhampton Beach in the vicinity of Moneybogue Bay, Westhampton Beach, NY, from 9:45 p.m. through 10:45
p.m. on August 20, 1994. The safety zone will cover all waters of Moneybogue Bay within a 1200 foot radius of the Marine
Towing Company fireworks barge, which will be located approximately in the center of Moneybogue Bay. This zone is
required to protect the maritime community from the dangers and potential hazards to navigation associated with
the fireworks display. Entry into or movement within this zone will be prohibited unless authorized by the Captain
of the Port or his on scene representative. Good cause exists for providing a comment period of less than 60 days. Due
to the date the application was received, only a 30 day comment period can be provided.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be minimal due to the limited duration of the fireworks display, the
small size of the safety zone, the low level or nonexistent commercial vessel traffic expected in the area during the
effective time of the zone, and the broadcast of marine safety advisories the day of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document reopens the public comment period for the proposed rule published on April 26, 1994. The proposal addressed
the issues EPA is considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove
a recommendation by the Ozone Transportation Committee (OTC) that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3021(a) of Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) requires that DOE, to the extent practicable,
provide that the obligation of not less than 10 percent of the total combined amounts obligated for contracts and subcontracts
pursuant to competitive procedures be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals or by women, historically Black colleges and universities, or colleges
and universities having a student body in which more than 20 percent of the students are Hispanic Americans or Native
Americans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE today proposes to amend the DEAR to establish DOE policies and procedures for implementing section 3021 of the
Energy Policy Act. The proposed amendments would add a new Part 926, Other Socioeconomic Programs, as the primary
regulatory coverage concerning section 3021 requirements. Part 952 would also be amended to add solicitation provisions
and contract clauses needed to effect section 3021 requirements in procurement actions. Finally, Part 970 would
be amended to address the application of section 3021 to DOE management and operating (M&amp;O) contracts. The specific
amendments to the DEAR needed to implement the requirements of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act are described
below. This rulemaking provides changes to the DEAR that will supersede an earlier internal DOE directive that provided
guidance to DOE employees on the implementation of section 3021. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policies implementing the legislation are tailored to achieve the intent of Congress in enacting section 3021,
but they go beyond previous contracting and subcontracting mechanisms which have been used to meet participation
goals for small disadvantaged business DOE contracts and subcontracts. DOE interprets section 3021 of EPACT as requiring
the accomplishment of expanded contracting and subcontracting goals and as providing DOE with the discretion to
find appropriate methods to do this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes that its approach to implementing the requirements of section 3021 is consistent with both the intent
of the Congress in passing the legislation and the long-standing policies of the Government to place a fair proportion
of contracts with small businesses and small disadvantaged business and to offer maximum practicable opportunity
to those organizations to participate as subcontractors.

The regulations at 48 CFR Part 9 are proposed to be amended to add a new part 926, Other Socioeconomic Programs, consisting
of Subpart 926.70, Implementation of Section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A section 926.7001 is proposed to state DOE policy, as set forth in section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act, concerning
the award of contracts and subcontracts to organizations meeting the three target group designations. In addition,
this section would establish the primary mechanisms that DOE would use in meeting its Energy Policy Act 10 percent
goal through the competitive procurement process, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Competitive Energy Policy Act requirements set aside for small disadvantaged businesses, including women-owned
businesses, under the Section 8(a) program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Competitive awards that provide an evaluation preference to offerors from among one of the three Energy Policy
Act target groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A section 926.7002 is proposed to establish that the requesting organization has the principal obligation to identify
which procurements are subject to the Energy Policy Act. In that determination, a program office would use as its standard
whether the instant requirement directly satisfies an Energy Policy Act program or requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A section 926.7003 is proposed to direct the use of DOE Small Business/Labor Surplus Area Set-Aside and 8(a) Program
Review Procedures as a mechanism to ensure that full consideration be given to identifying entities from among the
Energy Policy Act target groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A section 926.7004 is proposed to recognize the statutory change (as set forth in section 3021(b) of the Energy Policy
Act) to the size standard for engineering services under Energy Policy Act procurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A section 926.7005 is proposed to create an evaluation preference to be used in competitive procurements for Energy
Policy Act requirements, where such procurements have not been conducted under Section 8(a) competitive procedures.
The evaluation preference would take the form of an evaluation criterion providing that award shall be made to an entity
from among the Energy Policy Act target groups where such entity is among those under consideration for final selection
and is ranked as essentially equal to the best other proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, at section 926.7005 it is proposed to provide consideration of the proposer's subcontracting opportunities
to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups as part of the business management proposal evaluation
and, in Energy Policy Act requirements valued at more than $500,000, as part of the evaluation of the Small Business
and Small Business Subcontracting Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A section 926.7006 is proposed to provide guidance on reporting requirements needed to measure DOE performance in
meeting the 10 percent Energy Policy Act goal. In addition, this section identifies the types of contract awards that
will be counted toward the DOE goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instructions pertaining to the use of solicitation provisions and contract clauses relating to DOE section 3021
implementation are proposed to be contained in section 926.7007. The text of the solicitation provisions and contract
clauses relating to DOE implementation of section 3021 are provided in Subpart 952.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A solicitation provision is proposed at 952.226&hyph;70, entitled Subcontracting goals under section 3021(a)
of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486), to set out the subcontracting evaluation preference. Most
importantly, the provision requires offerors, that are not one of the three section 3021 target groups, to propose
individual subcontracting goals for each of the three target groups. In addition, the provision explains how the
evaluation preference will be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A contract clause at 952.226&hyph;72 is proposed to be added to facilitate implementation of the subcontracting
program goals and reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A clause is proposed to be added at section 952.226&hyph;73, entitled Energy Policy Act Target Group Certification,
establishing the certification to be used by entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups to clearly establish
their qualification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the clause at FAR 52.219&hyph;14 in all awards to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups would
place a contractual limitation on the amount of subcontracting that can be used by a minority college or university
or a woman-owned business in performance of a contract for an Energy Policy Act requirement. The limitation, which
restricts subcontracted effort to less than 50 percent of the cost incurred for personnel, mirrors a similar provision
now applied to small disadvantaged business under the Federal acquisition system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy has determined that today's regulatory action is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this
action was not subject to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. This proposed rule would, when adopted as a final rule, have no preemptive effect; will not have any effect on
existing Federal laws; and would only clarify the existing regulations on this subject. The revised clauses would
apply only to contracts which would be awarded after the effective date of the final rule, and, thus, would have no retroactive
effect. Therefore, DOE certifies that this proposed rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive
Order 12778.

preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will require only an insignificant addition to the data collection required for the Standard Forms 294 and
295. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

E. Review Under Executive Order 12612
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, and in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism
assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule, when finalized, will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. However, DOE has
determined that none of the revisions will have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional
functions of States.

F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has concluded that this rule falls into a class of actions (categorical exclusion A5) that are categorically excluded
from NEPA review because they would not individually or cumulatively have significant impact on the human environment,
as determined by the Department's regulations (10 CFR Part 1021, Subpart D) implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 4331&hyph;4335, 4341&hyph;4347 (1976)). Therefore, this rule does not require
an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.

A. Public Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the
rule should not have a substantial impact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses. Therefore,
pursuant to Pub. L. 95&hyph;91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the
Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.

(b) These three groups are collectively referred to in this section as ``Energy Policy Act target groups.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) DOE shall vigorously pursue the objectives of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act in the award of contracts and
subcontracts to the Energy Policy Act target groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The DOE implementation of the requirements of section 3021 with regard to the award of Energy Policy Act procurements
consists of the following, ranked in descending order of preference: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice responds to a petition submitted by John Kourik. The notice proposes to amend the requirements in Standard
No. 121, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Air Brake Systems,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include a definition of air-over-hydraulic brake subsystems. The agency believes that this proposed definition
would clarify the classification of vehicles equipped with these subsystems and thus eliminate the need for manufacturers
to request, and the agency to respond to, interpretations about them.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Air-over-hydraulic brake systems typically consist of an air brake system from the treadle valve to an air brake chamber
that provides the mechanical force to actuate a hydraulic-operated master cylinder. In turn, the hydraulic master
cylinder actuates the brake shoes or pads. The air brake chamber unit combined with the hydraulic-operated master
cylinder is called the ``power cluster'' and generally serves as the separating point between the air- and hydraulic-actuated
portions of the air-over-hydraulic brake system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air-over-hydraulic brake systems are installed on about one percent of medium and heavy trucks sold in the United
States. This percentage represents about 2,000 vehicles, most of which are Class 6 vehicles with gross vehicle weight
ratings (GVWRs) between 19,501 and 26,000 pounds.

a system that uses air as a medium for transmitting pressure or force from the driver control to the service brake, but

a subsystem of the air brake 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The italic portion of the definition of air-over-hydraulic subsystem explicitly states that an air-over-hydraulic
brake subsystem means a subsystem of the air brake system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In initially issuing Standard No. 121, NHTSA stated that ``it should be noted that the term `air brake system' as defined
in the standard applies to the brake configuration commonly referred to as `air-over-hydraulic,' in which failure
of either medium can result in complete loss of braking ability.'' (36 FR 3817, February 27, 1971). The agency reiterated
its position that an air-over-hydraulic brake system is subject to Standard No. 121, stating that ``Standard No.
105a [Hydraulic Brake Systems] does not apply to vehicles equipped with `air-over-hydraulic' systems, which remain
within the purview of Standard No. 121*&blank;*&blank;*.'' (37 FR 17970, September 2, 1972.) Moreover, NHTSA has
issued several interpretations stating that a vehicle equipped with an air-over-hydraulic brake system must comply
with the requirements in Standard No. 121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received a petition from Mr. John Kourik, requesting that the agency amend Standard No. 121 to specify that an
air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem is subject to that Standard. The petitioner stated that such an amendment would
avoid the need for manufacturers to request interpretations about air-over-hydraulic brake systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 121 by expanding the current definition
of air brake system to incorporate the definition of air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem. The agency notes that even
though the definition of an air brake system currently includes a description of an air-over-hydraulic subsystem,
it is not explicitly clear on the face of the standard that such a subsystem is classified as an air-braked system and
that a vehicle equipped with such a subsystem would thus have to comply with the requirements in Standard No. 121. NHTSA
believes that it would be appropriate to clarify the classification of air-over-hydraulic brake systems. By amending
the definition of an air brake system to state explicitly that an air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem is classified
as an air brake system, the agency would eliminate the need felt by some manufacturers to request interpretations
regarding the standard's applicability to vehicles equipped with air-over-hydraulic brake subsystems.

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is not ``significant''
within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. A full regulatory
evaluation is not required because the rule, if adopted, would have no mandatory effects. Instead, the proposal would
only codify a longstanding agency interpretation. Therefore, this rulemaking would not have any cost impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this action on small entities.
Based upon this evaluation, I certify that the proposed amendment would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle and brake manufacturers typically would not qualify as small entities.
This amendment would affect small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units to the extent that
these entities purchase vehicles. However, this amendment would have no significant cost impact on vehicles. For
these reasons, vehicle manufacturers, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which
purchase motor vehicles would not be significantly affected by the proposed requirements. Accordingly, no regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by the Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird), NHTSA has decided to propose
amending Standard No. 111, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Rearview Mirrors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, with respect to the field-of-view around school buses. Specifically, the agency is proposing to rescind a provision
in the Standard so that certain driving mirrors would no longer be required to provide a field-of-view of the ground
forward of cylinders by the bus's rear wheels to areas directly beneath the mirror surface. The agency is concerned
that the current requirement may compromise safety either by making it more difficult for the driver to use the driving
mirror when the bus is in motion as the result of having a more distorted image from a more convex mirror or by reducing
the driver's direct line of sight as the result of creating a larger blind spot near the bus.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Previous Agency Rulemakings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 111, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rear-View Mirrors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to ensure that a school bus provides an adequate field-of-view around a stopped school bus, thus reducing the risk
of school buses striking students as the students are approaching the buses in order to board them or as they are leaving
the buses. (57 FR 57015) The final rule requires each school bus to be equipped with two mirror systems on each side of
the bus: (1) ``System A,'' which consists of a flat driving mirror of unit magnification and typically a convex driving
mirror; and (2) ``System B,'' which consists of convex cross view mirrors for spotting students during the loading
and unloading of students. The System A mirror system must provide, among other things, a view of the area of the ground
extending rearward from the area below the mirror surface. The System B convex cross view mirrors must provide, among
other things, a view of the ground that overlaps with the view of the ground provided by System A. System A and System
B mirrors in combination are required to provide the driver with a view of the ground in front of and along both sides
of the bus and extending at least 200 feet rearward from the driving mirror. This final rule took effect on December
2, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA again evaluated the field-of-view requirements for System A mirrors in response to a petition for reconsideration
of the final rule submitted by Ford Motor Company (Ford). (58 FR 60399, November 16, 1993) Ford stated that requiring
System A mirrors to provide a view of the ground immediately beneath them fails to meet the need for safety and may make
impracticable the use of currently designed flat unit magnification mirrors. Ford requested that NHTSA amend the
requirement in Standard No. 111 that System A mirrors provide an extended rearward view of the ground starting from
the area beneath the mirror (S9.2(b)(1), (2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA decided not to adopt Ford's requested revision, because the agency was concerned that Ford's suggested System
A mirrors might have had blind spots in the area of the ground directly below the driver's mirrors and forward of the
rear edge of the side windows. The agency explained that it is permissible to use a combination of convex and flat mirrors
to meet the System A requirements, and that the convex portion of the mirror system can be used for the view beneath the
System A mirror. 57 FR at 57005.

II. Blue Bird Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) petitioned the agency to amend Standard No. 111 with respect to the field-of-view
requirements for System A mirrors. Blue Bird stated that to comply with the final rule's requirements, either a small
radius of curvature convex mirror or a second convex mirror would have to be attached to the System A mirror. Blue Bird
argued that either approach would be impracticable and inconsistent with motor vehicle safety. According to the
petitioner, a small radius of curvature mirror would provide unreasonably small and distorted images that would
be unsafe for driving, while a second convex mirror would create a larger blind spot for the driver. Blue Bird also stated
that any convex mirror added to a system A mirror should have a radius of curvature of at least 35 inches, since convex
mirrors with low radii of curvature would provide unreasonably small and distorted images thus causing problems
for the school bus driver, while the vehicle is in motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Blue Bird stated that the requirement, as adopted, is inconsistent with previous agency statements about problems
associated with using highly convex mirrors for driving. Blue Bird further stated that none of the discussions in
the NPRM explaining the requirements for System A mirrors implies the need for driving mirrors to see the area directly
below them. Blue Bird requested the agency immediately amend the wording of S9.2(b)(1) and S9.2(b)(2) to require
that System A mirrors provide views of the area of the ground that extend rearward from the test cylinders near the rear
axles to not less than 200 feet measured from the rear surface of the mirrors. As the result of such an amendment, the
System A mirrors would no longer be required to provide a view of the ground between those cylinders and the ground beneath
the mirror.

On January 13, 1994, agency personnel met with representatives of Blue Bird and Mirror Lite Company, a mirror manufacturer,
to evaluate the field-of-view provided by various mirror configurations on school buses. At that meeting, Blue Bird
stated that the installation and use of a driving mirror with a small radius of curvature may result in unsafe driving
practices since it distorts images, thus making it difficult for a driver to judge the distance between his or her bus
and following vehicles when the driver is attempting to change lanes. Similarly, Blue Bird alleged that, with a small
radius of curvature mirror, other vehicles appear to approach suddenly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, images of oncoming vehicles at the rear of the bus that are very small and difficult to recognize suddenly appear greatly
distorted as the vehicles get closer to the mirror).

Thomas Built Bus, another manufacturer of school buses, has contacted the agency to express its opposition to Blue
Bird's petition. After spending significant amounts of time and money reconfiguring and retesting its buses and
mirrors to comply with the final rule, Thomas Built believes that it would be inappropriate for the agency now to amend
the standard to accommodate a specific school bus or mirror design of another manufacturer. Memoranda memorializing
these contacts have been placed in the docket.

III. Agency Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 111 so that System A mirrors would
no longer be required to provide a field-of-view of the ground forward of cylinders by the bus's rear wheels to areas
directly beneath the mirror surface. The agency tentatively believes that the current requirement makes it necessary
for school bus manufacturers to install either a small radius of curvature convex mirror or a second convex mirror.
NHTSA is concerned that the current requirement may compromise safety either by making it more difficult for the driver
to use the driving mirror when the bus is in motion as the result of having a more distorted image from a more convex mirror
or by reducing the driver's direct line of sight as the result of creating a larger blind spot near the bus, based on Blue
Bird's demonstration and other available information. The agency has tentatively concluded that the driveability
problems resulting from requiring System A mirrors to have a view of the ground directly beneath them outweigh the
safety benefits obtained by having a redundant view of this area. Specifically, the agency believes that the proposed
amendment would not adversely affect pedestrian safety because System B mirrors would still be required to have a
view of the ground directly below the System A mirrors, as well as the areas alongside the bus to the rear axles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA did not anticipate that there would be a driveability problem associated with the System A mirror requirements
when it issued the final rule. The requirement that the driving mirrors provide a view of the ground from beneath the
mirror surface to 200 feet rearward was considered necessary because several pedestrian fatalities have occurred
near the front entrance doors and the rear tires. In issuing the final rule, NHTSA was aware that the System B convex
crossview mirror already provides a view of these areas. The agency's intention was to reduce the number of pedestrian
fatalities by providing the school bus driver with the largest field-of-view possible. Redundant views of these
areas seemed logical and the view of the test grid was comprehensive. However, the school buses with complying System
A mirrors were not actually driven as part of the agency evaluation of the new mirror system requirements in connection
with the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA requests comments about the potential safety problems discussed in this notice. To what extent does adding
a second convex mirror to a System A mirror increase the blind spot? How significant a safety problem is caused by the
increase in the blind spot? How significant a safety problem is caused by the driver's inability to use the entire mirror
system, particularly with mirrors with a radius of curvature less than 35 inches, while operating a moving bus? If
a manufacturer added a second convex mirror to a System A mirror system, couldn't the driver use the preexisting high
radius of curvature driving mirror? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to Blue Bird's request for the agency to ``immediately issue'' its requested change to the Standard, NHTSA has determined
that it cannot legally accommodate Blue Bird's request. The Administrative Procedure Act generally requires an
agency to issue a notice for public comment before issuing a final rule such as a rescission of a requirement. (5 U.S.C
553) There is one narrow exception to this requirement which provides that an agency may forego notice-and-comment
procedures upon a finding that such procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.''
( 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) However, the courts have construed this exception very narrowly, emphasizing that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
circumstances justifying reliance on this exception are ``indeed rare'' and will be accepted only after the court
has ``examine[d]'' closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice was not reviewed under E.Q. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' NHTSA has considered the impact
of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency
believes that a full regulatory evaluation is not required because the rule would have only minimal economic impacts.
The proposal, if adopted, would not result in any cost savings or cost increases since to comply, the small radius of
curvature mirrors would be replaced by larger radius of curvature mirrors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. School bus manufacturers
are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Small governmental units
and small organizations are generally affected by amendments to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards as purchasers
of new school buses. However, any impact on small entities from this action would be minimal since it would make a minimal
change that would not impose additional costs. Accordingly, the agency has determined that preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis is unnecessary.

This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State
may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the
Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies
only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires the Service to make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial
scientific or commercial information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent
practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and notice of the finding is to be published
promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service is also required to promptly commence a status review of the species involved.
Section 4(b)(3)(B) requires that the Service make a further finding as to whether or not a petition presenting substantial
information in support of listing, delisting, or reclassification of a species is (i) warranted, (ii) not warranted,
or (iii) warranted but precluded by work on other pending listing actions of higher priority on which expeditious
progress is being made. This finding is to be made within 12 months of receipt of the petition. Depending upon the conclusion
of the finding, the Service must promptly publish in the

), from threatened to endangered. On November 10, 1993, the Service informed the petitioners that their correspondence
had been accepted as a valid petition.

These 90-day and 12-month findings are based on published and unpublished biological and commercial information,
inter- and intra-agency communications, and communications with experts. All information used in these findings
is on file in the Service's Arizona Ecological Services State Office in Phoenix.

Spikedace and loach minnow are two small minnows which inhabit isolated stretches of stream in the upper reaches of
the Gila River basin in Arizona and New Mexico (Minckley 1973, Propst

 1988, Propst and Bestgen 1991, Rinne 1991). Their historic range included most of the Gila River basin; however, both
species have undergone dramatic declines since the late 1800's. These declines were due to water developments such
as impoundment, diversion, channelization, and groundwater pumping; to watershed degradation and erosion caused
by activities such as livestock grazing, timber harvest, road building, and recreation; and to effects of the introduction
and spread of nonnative fish species. Both species live in relatively fast flowing water in perennial stream stretches.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spikedace are presently known only from isolated stretches of the Gila River, Grant and Catron Counties, New Mexico;
Aravaipa Creek, Graham and Pinal Counties, Arizona; Eagle Creek, Greenlee County, Arizona; and the Verde River,
Yavapai County, Arizona. Loach minnow are presently known only from isolated stretches of the Gila River, Grant and
Catron Counties, New Mexico; Aravaipa Creek, Graham and Pinal Counties, Arizona; the East Fork and mainstem White
Rivers, Navajo and Gila Counties, Arizona; the San Francisco and Tularosa Rivers and Dry Blue Creek, Catron County,
New Mexico; and the Blue and San Francisco Rivers and Campbell Blue Creek, Greenlee County, Arizona. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spikedace was listed as a threatened species on July 1, 1986, and the loach minnow was listed as a threatened species
on October 28, 1986. Critical habitat was designated for both species on March 8, 1994. A threatened species is defined
by the Act as a species ``which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout
all or a significant portion of its range.'' An endangered species is defined by the Act as one ``which is in danger of
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the status of spikedace and loach minnow were reviewed as part of the 5-year review of the status of listed species
as required by section 4(c)(2) of the Act. That review showed that the status of the two species had become more precarious
over the previous five years due to substantial increases in threats. As a result, the Service found that both species
met the requirements for endangered status. The Desert Fishes Recovery Team and the Arizona Game and Fish Department
have recommended reclassification to endangered for both species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time that threats to the species are increasing, new genetic information suggests a need to preserve each
of the fragmented populations of spikedace and loach minnow in order to maintain as much genetic diversity in the species
as possible (Tibbets 1992). Four of the five remaining loach minnow populations have been subjected to genetic analyses
and each appears to be distinctive. Genetic analyses on the four remaining spikedace populations indicate that each
of the four populations is quite different, with the Verde River population being most distinct.

Petition Findings

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the petition and all other pertinent information, the Service finds that the petition presents substantial
information to indicate that reclassification to endangered may be warranted for spikedace and loach minnow. A positive
90-day finding generally requires that a status review be conducted on the petitioned species. However, as previously
mentioned, a status review was conducted in 1991, resulting in a finding that endangered status is appropriate, but
that higher-priority listing actions precluded the rulemaking process to reclassify the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benefits to the spikedace and loach minnow from reclassification to endangered status would include recognition
of the more precarious status of the species and increased penalties for conducting activities prohibited under
section 9 of the Act. However, these benefits would be incremental to the protection under the Act already applied
to these threatened species. This incremental protective increase is of lesser priority than providing protection
to species with no current legal protection under the Act.

After reviewing all available scientific and commercial information on the spikedace and loach minnow and their
status and after consideration of other listing actions and their priorities, the Service finds that the reclassification
of spikedace and loach minnow to endangered is warranted, but is precluded by work on pending listing actions of higher
priority on which expeditious progress is being made.

), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding
is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This finding is based on information contained in the petition and otherwise available to the Service at the time
the finding is made. If the finding is that substantial information was presented, the Service also is required to
promptly commence a review of the status of the species involved, if one has not already been initiated under the Service's
internal candidate assessment process.

On May 19, 1993, the Service received a petition dated May 10, 1993, from Ms. Mary Pat Matheson, Director of the University
of Utah's Red Butte Garden and Arboretum, to list 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lathyrus grimesii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

is a prostrate perennial herb. The distribution and habitat of the species are limited. It is an endemic species, known
only from the central portion of the Independence Mountains of Elko County, Nevada. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lathyrus grimesii

is generally restricted to steep, barren slopes with stony-clay talus substrates at high (7,000 to 8,000 foot) elevations.
The species was originally collected in vegetative condition in 1941, but was not recognized as a previously undescribed
species until it was collected in reproductive condition in 1980. The technical description of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. grimesii

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was known from a 1-square mile area in the Dorsey Creek drainage of the Independence Mountains. More recent information
indicates that the species' distribution is more extensive. Aerial surveys conducted in August 1993 resulted in
new findings north of the Dorsey Creek drainage, in the following drainages and tributaries: Deep Creek, Ott Creek,
Sheep Creek, Frost Creek, and Cap Winn Creek; and in the Bull Run Mountains, located west of the Independence Mountains
(John C. Parks, Independence Mining Company, Elko, Nevada, in litt.).

The petition and accompanying documentation state that the species is subject to impacts by proposed mineral exploration
and potential open pit heap leach gold mine development. Mine exploration roads have been constructed through existing
populations. With plants occurring on steep, barren slopes at high elevations, disturbance due to further mining
exploration and potential development could produce long term destabilization and erosion of slope habitat which
would reduce or eliminate populations of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. grimesii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The toxic effects of open pit heap leach gold mine development also have the potential to further reduce populations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lathyrus grimesii

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is not currently protected by any regulatory mechanism, as it is not included on the U.S. Forest Service ``Sensitive''
or State of Nevada ``Critically Endangered'' species lists. The available information suggests that the species'
restricted range and small population size increase the chance of extirpation resulting from stochastic (i.e. random)
or localized events such as rock slides, erosion, disease, toxic effects of contaminant spills, or predation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has reviewed the petition and other information available in the Service's files. On the basis of the best
scientific and commercial information available, the Service finds that substantial information has been presented
indicating that listing of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lathyrus grimesii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
may be warranted. This species was included as a category 2 candidate for listing in the notice of review published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51144). Although a status review of this species was initiated upon its inclusion in category
2, the Service hereby announces its formal review of the species' status pursuant to this 90-day petition finding.
The Service requests any additional data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested parties concerning the status of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. grimesii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of particular interest is information regarding (1) The existence and status of additional populations, (2) environmental
factors determining distribution, (3) pollinators, (4) toxic effects of cyanide on the species, and (5) genetic
variability in known populations.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces 90-day and 12-month findings on a petition to list 83 mollusc
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After careful assessment of the best scientific
and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the petitioned species, the
Service either finds that the petition did not present substantial information indicating that the requested action
may be warranted (90-day finding) or determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time (12-month
finding).

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service make a
finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. The finding is to be based on all information
available to the Service at the time the finding is made. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made
within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the Service finds that a petition presents substantial information indicating the requested action may be warranted,
then the Service initiates a status review on that species. Section 4 (b)(3)(b) of the Act requires that for any petition
that presents substantial scientific and commercial information, a finding be made within 12 months of the date of
receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but
precluded from immediate proposal by other pending proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species. Such 12-month
findings are to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has made a negative 90-day finding for 75 noncandidate species referenced in a petition to list 83 mollusc
species as threatened or endangered. The Service has made a positive 90-day finding, but not warranted 12-month finding
for the eight category 2 candidate species contained in the petition to list 83 mollusc species as threatened or endangered.
The Service has been assessing the status of these eight species since their designation as category 2 candidates.
Minimal new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign these species to category
2. As a result, the Service determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. These eight species
will be retained in category 2. This notice also serves to announce a negative 90-day finding on a previous petition
to list the giant Columbia River limpet (short-faced lanx) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fisherola nuttalli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as threatened or endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1993, the Service received a petition from the Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC) to list 83 mollusc
species as threatened or endangered. The petition was dated August 16, 1993. The document used to support the petition
was the report ``Mollusc Species of Special Concern within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl'' (Frest and Johannes
1993) prepared for the President's Proposed Forest Plan. On November 6, 1987 the Service received a petition from
Dr. Peter Bowler of Laguna Beach, California, to list the giant Columbia River limpet as endangered. The giant Columbia
River limpet, or short-faced lanx, was one of the species included in the ONRC petition and was evaluated along with
the other petitioned species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition involves 36 land snails, 7 slugs, 37 freshwater snails, and 3 freshwater clams. The species are found
primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho. Most of these species are associated with late-successional
forests or riparian areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service's finding is based on information in the petition, references in the petition, Service files, and consultations
with malacologists, Service, and other Federal and State personnel. All documents are on file in the Service's Regional
Office in Portland, Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate rangewide surveys have not been completed for any of the species, except for the Trinity bristlesnail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Monadenia setosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (a category 2 candidate). The Service also lacks evidence of specific threats throughout the ranges of any of the
petitioned taxa, especially any threat associated with a population decline. Many of the species covered by this
petition may be sensitive to ecological perturbations resulting from the impacts of human activities. However,
information was not presented to show correlations between the species' ecological sensitivity and any declines
in population numbers. The taxonomic distinctiveness or validity of many of the species has not been determined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service encourages all interested parties to investigate the population status of and threats to all the species
considered in this petition. The Service also encourages all interested parties to submit information that may provide
additional specific information on the status of these species or specific threats to their survival.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a threatened species is being extended to allow time for additional field surveys and data analysis. This species
now persists in isolated populations in southern Michigan and adjacent Indiana and Ohio, as well as southern Indiana,
southeastern Illinois, and adjacent Kentucky. It occurs in lowland swamps and adjacent woodland and upland areas.
During prior comment periods, new questions were raised by herpetologists and State conservation departments as
to the merits of including intergrades in the listing and the sufficiency of information on the boundaries between
intergrade and pure populations. The comment period on the proposal is reopened.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The northern copperbelly water snake was proposed for listing as a threatened species due to strong evidence that
its range and numbers have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat, and that
the threats to the habitat and to the snakes are continuing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice proposing the northern copperbelly water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snake for classification as a threatened species was published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43860). During the subsequent
comment period, the Service received several letters from herpetologists and State conservation departments regarding
intergradation between 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. neglecta 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. flavigaster 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(yellow-bellied water snake). The latter subspecies occurs in southwestern Illinois and in the western portions
of Kentucky and Tennessee, and also is widespread in the Gulf Coast States and the southern Atlantic Coast States.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the ranges of the two subspecies come into contact there are numerous individuals having characteristics intermediate
between the two subspecies. These individuals are referred to as intergrades. There are also localized populations
which are largely composed of intergrades known as intergrade populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the concerns that were expressed during the comment period dealt with two inter-related issues: (1) the merits
of including intergrade populations and/or intergrade individuals in the listing and thus giving them protection
as threatened, and (2) the insufficiency of currently available information on the locations of boundaries between
intergrade populations and ``pure'' populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. neglecta. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These concerns are particularly acute in southern Illinois where the Department of Conservation believes that additional
surveys are critical to an adequate understanding of the status of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. neglecta 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and its relationship to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. flavigaster. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Results from these surveys are expected to be placed on review at the Service Office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section, when they become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act allows an extension of the normal 1-year deadline for taking final actions on a proposal
to list a species for up to 6 months when there is a ``substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency or accuracy
of the available data relevant to the determination.'' The Service believes that there is substantial disagreement
regarding the status of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. neglecta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to collect additional data on the extent and locations of intergrade populations, to resolve questions regarding
the most appropriate taxonomic entity to protect under the Act, and to obtain current data on the status of N. e. neglecta

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Illinois, the Service is extending the deadline for the listing determination until February 18, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the proposed rule originally closed October 18, 1993. It was reopened March 22 and closed April
22, 1994. The Service is reopening the comment period until November 1, 1994. Written comments should be submitted
to the Service office in the Addresses section.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The temporary regulations (TD 8553) published in the Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Regulations section of this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regulations on Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the Source (26 CFR part 31), and the Excise Tax Procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 40). These amendments relate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits of taxes by electronic funds transfer. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that will result from the regulations proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this notice would be based on the text of the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and would provide rules for the gradual phase-in of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirement for taxpayers to deposit certain taxes by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
text of these proposed regulations. The preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary regulations explains these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these rules and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code, a copy of this notice of proposed rulemaking will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business Administration for comment on its impact on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely submitted to the IRS. All comments will be available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for October 3, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning at 10:00 a.m. at the IRS Auditorium. Because of access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must submit written comments by September 12, 1994, and submit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to each topic by September 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NAFTA Implementation Act authorizes the imposition of a temporary duty (snapback) for Mexican frozen concentrated
orange juice when certain conditions exist. Mexican articles falling under subheading 2009.11.00 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are subject to the snapback duty provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 309(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, certain price conditions must exist before the United States
can apply a snapback duty on imports of Mexican frozen concentrated orange juice. In addition, such imports must exceed
specified quantities before the snapback duty can be applied. The price conditions exist when for each period of 5
consecutive business days the daily price for frozen concentrated orange juice is less than the trigger price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this provision, the term ``daily price'' means the daily closing price of the New York Cotton Exchange,
or any successor as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture (the ``Exchange''), for the closest month in which
contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice are being traded on the Exchange. The term ``business day'' means
a day in which contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice are being traded on the Exchange. The term ``trigger
price'' means the average daily closing price of the Exchange for the corresponding month during the previous 5-year
period, excluding the year with the highest average price for the corresponding month and the year with the lowest
average price for the corresponding month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Price conditions no longer exist when the Secretary determines that for a period of 5 consecutive business days the
daily price for frozen concentrated orange juice has exceeded the trigger price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever the price conditions are determined to exist or to cease to exist the Secretary is required to immediately
notify the Commissioner of Customs of such determination. Whenever the determination is that the price conditions
exist and the quantity of Mexican articles of frozen concentrated orange juice entered exceeds (1) 264,978,000 liters
(single strength equivalent) in any of calendar years 1994 through 2002, or (2) 340,560,000 liters (single strength
equivalent) in any of calendar years 2003 through 2007, the rate of duty on Mexican articles of frozen concentrated
orange juice that are entered after the date on which the applicable quantity limitation is reached and before the
date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the determination that the price conditions have ceased to exist shall be the lower of_(1) the column 1_General
rate of duty in effect for such articles on July 1, 1991; or (2) the column 1_General rate of duty in effect on that day.
For the purpose of this provision, the term ``entered'' means entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption
in the customs territory of the United States.

Needs and Uses:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A critical component in conducting a census is a current and accurate address list of all living quarters. The Census
Bureau will use two primary methods to create and update its address files: precanvass in urban areas (enumerators
systematically canvass census blocks to verify or update addresses on the census address list) and prelist in rural
areas (enumerators systematically canvass census blocks to obtain the physical location address and/or the mailing
address of all structures where people live or could live). In addition to these methods the Census Bureau will receive
additional address update information from outside sources including the United States Postal Service, local governments,
and the ``Be Counted!'' campaign. The added addresses from these outside sources will be field verified to confirm
their existence before being added to the census address list. The 1995 Census Test &hyph; Field Verification Operation
will help verify the accuracy and completeness of the Census Bureau's address control file that we will use for the
delivery of census test questionnaires.

Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be,
sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Act).

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the notice of initiation on February 22, 1994 (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994), the following events have occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 17, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Departmental Efforts to Obtain Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During March and April 1994, the Department requested information relating to producers/exporters of the subject
merchandise in the PRC, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On March 3, 1994, we sent an abbreviated section A questionnaire to China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On March 4, 1994, we sent a cable to the American Embassy in Beijing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On March 11, 1994, we sent a cable to the American Embassy in Tokyo, and to the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On April 7, 1994, we sent an abbreviated section A questionnaire to the China Chamber of Commerce of Imports
&amp; Exports of Foodstuffs, Native Produce, and Animal By-Products (China Chamber) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having received no response to our initial inquiries, follow-up requests for information were made as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On April 7, 1994, to MOFTEC; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On April 15, 1994, to the American Embassies in Beijing and Tokyo, and to the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents and Status of Questionnaires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 11 and 12, 1994, the Department received information from MOFTEC and the American Embassy in Beijing, respectively,
containing the names and addresses of 40 producers/exporters of the subject merchandise in the PRC. Based on an analysis
of ships' manifest data (PIERS), the Department estimated that the named respondents accounted for approximately
40 percent of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation. Consequently,
on May 18, 1994, the Department sent 40 antidumping questionnaires to the named firms, with additional copies sent
to MOFTEC and the China Chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following an entry of appearance by counsel for a previously unnamed producer/exporter, the Department sent a questionnaire
to this additional firm on May 31, 1994. Finally, at the request of a second previously unnamed producer/exporter,
the Department sent a questionnaire to this additional firm on June 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 2, 1994, the Department issued a decision memorandum which stated that we would not postpone our preliminary
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on reasonably supported allegations submitted by petitioner on June 10, 1994, the Department initiated an
investigation on June 14, 1994, of whether critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from
the PRC. On June 14 and 21, 1994, the Department requested monthly shipment data for exports to the United States from
questionnaire recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves,
whether or not peeled, fresh, chilled, frozen, provisionally preserved, or packed in water or other neutral substance,
but not prepared or preserved by the addition of other ingredients or heat processing. The differences between grades
are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subject merchandise is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. The subject garlic is currently classifiable
under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, 0710.80.9750, 0711.90.6000, and 2005.90.9500 of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope description provided above differs from the scope description used by the Department in its notice of initiation
of this investigation (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994). Changes to the scope include (a) the addition of more concise
language (and additional HTS subheadings) related to the packing of the subject merchandise, and (b) additional
language to exclude further processed products. The revisions are a result of comments received from the Customs
Service on March 17 and June 30, 1994, and from counsel for petitioner on June 29 and 30, 1994.

Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation (POI) is August 1, 1993, to January 31, 1994.

Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA)
is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise in this investigation. In deciding whether to use BIA, section
776(c) provides that the Department may take into account whether the respondent was able to produce information
requested in a timely manner and in the form required. In this case, exporters of fresh garlic from the PRC did not respond
to our requests for information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As outlined in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, the Department made several attempts to obtain information
from a number of sources. We have not received any responses to our questionnaire with which to perform our antidumping
analysis. Consequently, we based our preliminary determination in this investigation on BIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperate in an investigation, and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who do not cooperate in an investigation. Since the potential respondents in this case have
not cooperated, we assigned a BIA margin based on the most adverse assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, BIA is the highest margin contained in the petition (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994), and is listed below for all manufacturers, producers and exporters of fresh garlic
in the PRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. Section
733(e)(1) of the Act provides that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist
if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of investigation at less than its fair value, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding criterion (A) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more as sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping. Since the preliminary estimated dumping margin for all exporters of fresh garlic in the PRC is in excess
of 25 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping under section 733(e)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding criterion (B) above, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f), we generally consider the following factors in determining
whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) the volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal
trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. If imports during
the period immediately following the petition increase by 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately
preceding the filing of a petition, we consider them massive. Respondents have failed to respond to the Department's
questionnaire, as well as to our request for monthly export data. As a result, the Department has assumed, as BIA, that
there have been massive imports over a relatively short period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, because the dumping margin is sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping, and because we have determined
that imports of fresh garlic have been massive, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances do exist
in this investigation.

Suspension of Liquidation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of fresh garlic from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date 90 days before the date of publication of
this notice in the

the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 21&hyph;3, COBOL, which adopts ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985,
and ANSI X3.23a 1989, is being proposed for Federal use. This revision will adopt the forthcoming amendment (ANSI
X3.23b&hyph;1993) to American National Standard for COBOL which adds corrections and clarification to the language.
The proposed amendment is upwardly compatible with the current standard except for the reserved word FUNCTION.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard COBOL, as specified in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985,
X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23b&hyph;1993, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) This revision
supersedes FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 and reflects corrections and clarifications to the COBOL specifications. The American
National Standards define the elements of the COBOL programming language and the rules for their use. The purpose
of the standards is to promote portability of COBOL programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standards
are used by implementors as the reference authority in developing processors and by users who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard language.

Objectives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more
effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary
objectives of Federal programming language standards are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.

Applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications and programs
that are either developed or acquired for government use. FIPS COBOL is one of the high level programming language
standards provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS COBOL is especially suited for applications
that emphasize the manipulation of characters, records, files, and input/output (in contrast to those primarily
concerned with scientific and numeric computations).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. The use of FIPS high level programming languages is strongly recommended when one or more of the following situations
exist:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
_It is anticipated that the life of the program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of
different makes, models and configurations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program will or might be run on equipment other than for which the program is initially written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through
the use of this high level language regardless of interchange potential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (i.e., State and local governments,
and others).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Nonstandard language features should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot reasonably be implemented
with the standard features alone. Although nonstandard language features can be very useful, it should be recognized
that their use may make the interchange of programs and future conversion to a revised standard or replacement processor
more difficult and costly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. It is recognized that programmatic requirements may be more economically and efficiently satisfied through the
use of report generation, database management, or text processing languages. The use of any facility should be considered
in the context of system life, system cost, data integrity, and the potential for data sharing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Programmatic requirements may be also more economically and efficiently satisfied by the use of automatic program
generators. However, if the final output of a program generator is a COBOL source program, then the resulting program
should conform to the conditions and specifications of FIPS COBOL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. When it is determined that a programming language that has been adopted as a FIPS is to be used for an application or
program, a processor conforming to the FIPS programming language shall be used, if available. It is not intended that
existing programs be rewritten solely for the purpose of conforming to a FIPS programming language. If a program is
to be part of an existing application written in a programming language not conforming to a FIPS, the language processor
used for the existing application may be used for the new program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FIPS COBOL specifications are the same as American National Standard COBOL as specified in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985,
ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23b&hyph;1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985, ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1989 and ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1993 specify the form of a program written in
COBOL, formats for data, and rules for program and data interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards do not specify limits on the size of programs, minimum system requirements, the means of supervisory
control of programs, or the means of transforming programs internally for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the following requirements apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For purposes of FIPS COBOL, the modules defined in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985 and ANSI X3.23a&hyph;1989 are combined
into three subsets and four optional modules. The three subsets are identified as Minimum, Intermediate, and High.
The four optional modules are Report Writer, Communication, Debug, and Segmentation. These four optional modules
may be associated with any of the subsets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The high subset is composed of all language elements of the highest level of all required modules. The intermediate
subset is composed of all language elements of level 1 of all required modules except the Intrinsic Function module.
The minimum subset is composed of all language elements of level 1 of the Nucleus, Sequential I&hyph;O, and Inter-Program
Communication modules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following table reflects the composition of the required subsets and the relationship of the subsets and the optional
modules. The numbers in the table refer to the level within a module as designated in ANSI X3.23&hyph;1985 and ANSI
X3.23A&hyph;1989, and a dash denotes the corresponding module is omitted or may be omitted.

b. A facility must be available in the processor for the user to optionally specify monitoring of the source program
at compile time. The monitoring may be specified for a FIPS COBOL subset, for any of the optional modules, for all of
the obsolete language elements included in the processor, or for a combination of a FIPS COBOL subset, optional modules,
and all obsolete elements. The monitoring may be specified for any FIPS COBOL subset at or below the highest subset
for which the processor is implemented and for a level of an optional module at or below the level of the optional module
for which the processor is implemented. The monitoring is an analysis of the syntax used in the source program against
the syntax included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules. Any syntax used in the source program
that does not conform to that included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules will be diagnosed
and identified to the user through a message on the source program listing. Any syntax for an obsolete language element
included in the processor and used in the source program will also be diagnosed and identified through a message on
the source program listing. The determination of the need to flag any given source program syntax in accordance with
these requirements cannot be logically resolved until the syntactic correctness of the source program has been established.
The message provided will identify:

_The syntax as ``nonconforming standard'' if the nonconforming syntax is included in the processor but is not within
the user selected FIPS COBOL subset or optional modules unless monitoring is selected for the obsolete category;
in that case obsolete language elements are only flagged as ``obsolete''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The syntax as ``nonconforming nonstandard'' if the nonconforming syntax is a nonstandard extension included in
the processor.

Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The implementation of FIPS COBOL involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of COBOL processors, interpretation
of FIPS COBOL, and validation of COBOL processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acquisition of COBOL Processors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This publication is effective [insert a date 90 days after the approval date]. COBOL processors acquired for Federal
use after this date should implement at least one of the required subsets of FIPS COBOL. If the functionality of one
or more of the optional modules meets programmatic requirements, then those optional modules also should be acquired.
Each optional module that is needed to meet programmatic requirements should be explicitly cited as a requirement
in the order for the processor. Conformance to FIPS COBOL should be considered whether COBOL processors are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transition period provides time for industry to produce COBOL processors conforming to the standard. The transition
period begins on the effective date and continues for one (1) year thereafter. The following apply during the transition
period:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The provisions of FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 apply to processors ordered before the effective date but delivered subsequent
to the effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The provisions of this publication apply to orders placed after the effective date; however, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 21&hyph;4, if available, may be acquired for use prior to the effective date. If a conforming processor
is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 21&hyph;3 may be acquired for interim use during the transition
period.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 119, Ada, will adopt the revised voluntary
industry specifications, American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization
Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, as a Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS). American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference
Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, specifies the form and meaning of programs written
in Ada. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of Ada programs for use on a variety of data processing
systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters,
or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

8. Objectives. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies
to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources.
The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard language specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications that are either
developed or acquired for government use. FIPS Ada is one of the high level programming language standards provided
for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS Ada is suitable for use in programming and any applications for
which there is no specific language available specifically targeted to that application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The use of FIPS Ada is recommended for the following applications and situations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Those involving control of real-time or parallel processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Very large systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Systems with requirements for very high reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Systems which are to be developed with reusable software packages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_When it is anticipated that the life of an application will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of
different makes, models and configurations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

10. Specifications. FIPS Ada specifications are the language specifications contained in American National Standard
and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC
8652:1994 standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the
Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994 standard document specifies the form of a program written in Ada,
the effect of translating and executing a program, predefined library entities that must be supplied, and detection
of compilation and/or link errors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard does not specify limits on the size or complexity of programs, the results when the rules of the standard
fail to establish an interpretation, the means of supervisory control of programs, or the means of transforming programs
for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Implementation. The implementation of FIPS Ada involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition
of Ada processors, interpretation of FIPS Ada, and validation of processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.1&blank;Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective ninety (90) days after the publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Ada Processors acquired for Federal use after this date should
conform to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transition period provides time for industry to produce Ada language processors conforming to the standard. The
transition period begins on the effective date and ends March 1, 1997. The provisions of FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1 apply
to orders placed after the effective date of this publication. If, during the transition period, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1 is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 119 may be acquired for interim use during
the transition period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This transition period is intended to give implementations that conform to FIPS PUB 119 time to make the enhancements
necessary to enable conformance to FIPS PUB 119&hyph;1. No further transitional period is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.2&blank;Acquisition of Ada Processors. Conformance to FIPS Ada should be considered whether Ada processors
are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used
under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology
for procurement of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp;
Telecommunications Standards Index, Chapter 4 Part 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.3&blank;Interpretation of FIPS Ada. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution
of questions (see FIPS PUB 29&hyph;3, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 29 October 1992) regarding the
specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation
of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS Ada Interpretation,
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, FAX:
301&hyph;948&hyph;6213, e-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.4&blank;Validation of Ada Processors. Implementations of FIPS Ada shall be validated in accordance with the
NIST Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS Ada. Recommended procurement terminology
for validation of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications Standards Index
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation,
Prior Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option and shall
specify whether a Validation Summary Report or Certificate of Validation is required. The agency shall specify appropriate
time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Validated Products List 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for information about the validation status of Ada products. This information may be used to specify validation time
frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate
is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the Ada implementation offered. The criteria for applicability
of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require
that the offered version/release of the Ada implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software
environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter
settings; e.g., the same parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), is being proposed.
This proposed revision corrects a technical flaw that made the standard less secure than had been thought. The algorithm
is still reliable as a security mechanism, but the correction returns the SHS to the original level of security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SHS produces a 160-bit output called a message digest for a message of any size. This message digest can be used with
FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), to compute a signature for the message. The same message digest should
be obtained by the verifier of the signature when the received version of the message is used as input to the Secure Hash
Algorithm (SHA). Any change to the message in transmit should produce a different message digest, indicating to the
verifier that a change has been made to the message.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, state, and local government
users prior to submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) specifications which deal with the technical aspects of
the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interest parties may obtain
copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards
and Technology, Technology Building, Room B&hyph;64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.

Name of Standard: Secure Hash Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category of Standard: Computer Security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Explanation: This Standard specifies a secure hash algorithm, SHA&hyph;1, for computing a condensed representation
of a message or a data file. When a message of any length &lt;2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bits is input, the SHA&hyph;1 produces a 160-bit output called a message digest. The message digest can then be input
to the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which generates or verifies the signature for the message (see Figure 1).
Signing the message digest rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process because the message
digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The same hash algorithm must be used by the verifier of a digital
signature as was used by the creator of the digital signature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SHA&hyph;1 is called secure because it is computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a
given message digest, or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest. Any change to a message
in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and the signature will fail to verify.
SHA&hyph;1 is a technical revision of SHA (FIPS 180). A circular left shift operation has been added to the specifications
in section 7, line b, page 9 of FIPS 180 and its equivalent in section 8, line c, page 10 of FIPS 180.* This revision improves
the security provided by this standard. The SHA&hyph;1 is based on principles similar to those used by Professor Ronald
L. Rivest of MIT when designing the MD4 message:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) develops fire safety standards which are known collectively as
the National Fire Codes. Federal agencies frequently use these standards as the basis for developing Federal regulations
concerning fire safety. Often, the Office of the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 approves the incorporation by reference of these standards under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

Standards developed by the technical committees of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) have been used
by various Federal Agencies as the basis for Federal regulations concerning fire safety. The NFPA standards are known
collectively as the National Fire Codes. Often, the Office of the Federal Register approves the incorporation by
reference of these standards under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions of existing standards and adoption of new standards are reported by the technical committees at the NFPA's
Fall Meeting in November or at the Annual Meeting in May each year. The NFPA invites public comment on its Report on Proposals.

 on June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34568), CITA announces that Customs would be conducting other investigations of transshipments
of textiles produced in China and exported to the United States. Based on these investigations, the U.S. Customs Service
has determined that textile products in Categories 339 and 352, produced or manufactured in China and entered into
the United States with the incorrect country of origin, were transshipped in circumvention of the Memorandum of Understanding
dated January 17, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China. Consultations
were held between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China on this matter on June 9 through
10, 1994. Accordingly, in the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to
charge the following amounts to the 1994 quota levels for the categories listed below:

The Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China reached agreement, effected by exchange of
notes dated June 23, 1994 and June 27, 1994, to establish an export visa arrangement for certain silk apparel products,
produced or manufactured in China and exported from China on and after July 15, 1994. Goods exported during the period
July 15, 1994 through August 15, 1994 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa. All goods exported after August 15,
1994 must be accompanied by a visa.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the 1994 U.S. CORRELATION: Silk Apparel
Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see

 notice 59 FR 15381, published on April 1, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are advised to take all necessary steps to ensure that such silk apparel products that are entered
into the United States for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, will meet the visa requirements
set forth in the letter published below to the Commissioner of Customs.

Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); pursuant
to the Silk Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes dated June 23, 1994 and June 27, 1994, between the Governments
of the United States and the People's Republic of China; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651
of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on July 15, 1994, entry into the Customs territory
of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption
and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of silk apparel products in Categories 733&hyph;736, 738&hyph;748,
750&hyph;752, 758 and 759, produced or manufactured in China and exported from China on and after July 15, 1994 for
which the Government of the People's Republic of China has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below.
Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement or become
subject to import quotas, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement
on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period July 15, 1994 through August 15, 1994 shall not be denied
entry for lack of a visa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking
in blue ink will appear on the front of the original export license/commercial invoice or successor document. The
license will be printed on a purple guilloche pattern background. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate
copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into
the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each visa stamp shall include the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical
digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for China is ``CN''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying
the shipment; e.g., 4CN123456.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The signature of the issuing official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment
as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTS or successor documents) shall be reported in the spaces provided within the visa stamp (e.g., ``Cat. 340&hyph;510
DOZ'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise
may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the
actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise,
the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature,
category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in
any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the
quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered
shall be charged to any applicable quota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the People's Republic of China,
replacement visa issued by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., or a visa waiver may be
issued by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements at the request of the Embassy of the People's
Republic of China in Washington, D.C., and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment
will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive
the quota requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The replacement visa shall consist of a Textile Export Visa/Invoice form bearing an official Chinese Embassy embossed
stamp on the front and include the standard information required on an export visa and the signature of an official
authorized by the Government of the People's Republic of China to issue replacement visas. The signature must match
one of two original signatures of authorized officials provided to the Government of the United States by the Government
of the People's Republic of China. U.S. Customs shall not permit entry of the shipment if any of the information required
on the replacement visa is missing, incorrect or illegible, or has been crossed out or altered in any way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct
category limit. If a shipment from the People's Republic of China has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United
States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall
charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered
by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked
commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The visa stamp remains unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions taken concerning the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to imports of textiles
and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of
Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the
Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs
exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal was a solicited application. The primary purpose of the World Geothermal Conference (WGC) 1995 is to
provide a forum for international exchange of scientific and technological information on geothermal development
during the period 1990&hyph;1995. The International Geothermal Association (IGA) is convening and organizing
the WGC. The Department believes that the proposed effort will benefit the public, and that providing financial assistance
through a grant mechanism is an appropriate method for providing funding. Through this financial assistance the
U.S. Department of Energy will be listed as a sponsor of the WGC. Competition for this effort would have an adverse effect
on the urgency and completion of the activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``.&blank;.&blank;. providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology .&blank;.&blank;. necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information .&blank;.&blank;.''. The IGA will do this by providing a forum on an
international scale where the U.S. geothermal industry can exchange scientific and technological information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of this effort is to convene an international conference where governments and industry can meet and
share scientific and technological information as well as their relevant experiences. The WGC '95 will provide the
forum for presentations of world-wide electrical and direct use, country updates, reports on international cooperative
projects and other invited papers. Pre-congress courses will be taught by experts in the field on subjects such as:
Drafting a Geothermal Project for Financing by International Organizations, Injections, Drilling Technology
and Regulation, Software for Geothermal Applications, Geothermal Heat Pumps, Small Power Plants, Direct Uses and
Environmental Aspects of Geothermal Development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the IGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff of the International Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to provide this service. The IGA
is an international association for the geothermal industry. Its membership includes 1,971 organizations and individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IGA's base of operations is an office in Berkeley, California, and is fully capable of meeting their needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public benefit to be derived from the World Geothermal Conference is the opportunity for the geothermal industry
to meet and exchange information and experiences, as well as to encourage research, development and use of geothermal
energy world wide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The services provided through this proposed grant fully support the program's direction and objectives. The International
Geothermal Association is taking the lead role in organizing, convening and marketing the World Geothermal Conference
1995. The IGA is qualified and positioned to undertake this task since they organized the last WGC in New Zealand in
1993. Competition for this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the urgency and completion of the proposed
activities.

foundation and technology *&blank;*&blank;* necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' (quotation from the Energy Mission Statement).
The National Geothermal Association (NGA) will do this by providing services to support the geothermal industry
through various activities and will work to create a business environment in which the industry can thrive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this financial assistance the NGA (a non-profit organization) will mount an aggressive campaign of information
dissemination, technology transfer and outreach. The objectives for this grant are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Geothermal Energy Conference_The second annual conference on geothermal energy will be held in the Washington,
D.C. area approximately 1 month after this Agreement is in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Geothermal EPACT/Climate-Change Action Group_This group will be comprised of representatives of the geothermal
industry, the utility industry, utility regulators and environmental- and energy-advocacy groups. The purpose
of the group will be to devise initiatives that the geothermal industry and DOE could undertake through cost-sharing
arrangements and that address accelerated use of geothermal resources in the United States, thereby helping to reduce
greenhouse gases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Utility Outreach Program_The NGA will provide the data and documentation that utilities and utility commissioners
need in order to understand geothermal power generation better and incorporate it into their portfolios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Develop information on Exporting Goods and Services_Information will be developed that will aid the U.S. geothermal
industry in exporting its goods and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Environmental Brochure_A brochure will be developed with the theme ``Geothermal is Clean Air''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Quarterly Newsletter_A quarterly newsletter on geothermal energy will be published and widely distributed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Educational Cooperative-Action Alliance_Formation of an alliance to exchange information and coordinate
activities of the various entities in the geothermal community who are producing educational materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Washington, D.C. Office_The NGA will maintain an office in the Washington, D.C. area. The purpose of this office
is to develop and maintain the contacts that are necessary for the operation of a domestic as well as an international
export program, to provide educational assistance to various environmental, public interest, and government groups,
and to be able to respond rapidly to problems and opportunities that arise in Washington, D.C. No lobbying activities
will be supported through the funds provided by this grant.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the NGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff of the National Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to provide this service. The NGA President
and President elect, respectively, is Tsvi Meidav and Phillip Michael Wright. After the merger of the NGA and GRA into
the Geothermal Energy Association, the Chairman position will be shared jointly by Phillip Michael Wright and David
R. Cox (Chairman of the GRA). David Anderson will serve as the Western Executive Director; he has been the Executive
Director of the NGA since it was established in 1985. These individuals are highly respected throughout the geothermal
industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NGA's base of operation is an office in Davis, California, and is fully capable of meeting their needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public benefit to be derived from the above mentioned projects and activities are an enhanced awareness of the
benefits of geothermal energy. All of the NGA's proposed activities, projects and efforts are to enhance the competitive
position of the U.S. geothermal industry in the domestic and international energy markets, to develop and conduct
educational programs on geothermal energy and to distribute information. Through this program the NGA will be supporting
the U.S. geothermal industry's efforts to bring more clean, domestic geothermal energy on line.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The services provided through the proposed grant fully support the program's direction and objectives. The National
Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to perform the above mentioned tasks. The NGA is an accepted and
respected industry association and has about 40 member companies, largely from the geothermal service industries.
The NGA has established an information network which is continually growing. Competition for this effort would have
a significant adverse impact on the accomplishment and completion of the proposed activities.

Take notice that on July 1, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, SE.,
Charleston, West Virginia 25314, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;639&hyph;000
pursuant to sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for permission and approval to abandon deteriorated
pipe on Line 1740 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, West Virginia, and to replace the abandoned facilities, all

 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, and replace with approximately 6.5 miles of 20-inch diameter pipe and 0.1 mile
of 16-inch diameter pipe as an auxiliary crossover pipeline on five segments of Line 1740. Columbia does not request
authorization for any new or additional service. Columbia states that the proposed pipeline sections would have
equivalent design delivery capacity and the facilities proposed for abandonment are obsolete due to class location
changes or are physically deteriorated to the extent that replacement is deemed advisable. The proposed construction
would cost approximately $6,624,000 and the estimated net debit to retirement associated with the abandonment is
$331,000.

and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGT states that it proposes to abandon a 1-inch inactive delivery tap and metering facilities originally installed
to serve a customer of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, Sunray Midcontinent_T. Lusty Lease, located on NGT's Line
634&hyph;8 in Seminole County, Oklahoma.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Section 205.282(b) of the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy, 10 C.F.R. &sect;205.282(b),
notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set forth below. The Proposed Decision relates
to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc., Gray Trucking Company and William
Valentine &amp; Sons, Inc., which settled alleged violations of the DOE price regulations involving these firms'
sales of crude oil during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures and standards that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
funds remitted by these firms and being held in escrow. The DOE has proposed to distribute the funds in accordance with
the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986)
(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and
injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each
state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would
be based on the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate
injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to submit two copies of their comments. Comments should be submitted within 30 days of publication of
this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in these proceedings
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1:00 to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence
Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585.

In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the
Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed three Petitions for the Implementation of Special Refund
Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on July 17, 1992, December 7, 1993 and April 13, 1994, respectively.
The Petitions request that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant
to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc. (Western), Gray Trucking Company
(Gray) and William Valentine &amp; Sons, Inc. (Valentine).

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period of Federal petroleum price controls, Western was engaged in crude oil refining and reselling.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The firm was therefore subject to regulations governing the pricing of crude oil set forth at 10 C.F.R. Parts 205, 210,
211, and 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations. As a result of an ERA audit of its operations,
a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) was issued to Western on April 4, 1984 pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart O (ERA
Docket No. 940X00182). The PRO alleged violations of the pricing and certification rules that applied to crude oil
resellers. Essentially, the firm was charged with selling price-controlled crude oil as uncontrolled stripper
well crude oil at unlawfully high prices in violation of the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L and 10 C.F.R.
&sect;212.131. In another enforcement proceeding, on May 7, 1981, a Notice of Probable Violation was issued to Western
which alleged that the firm unlawfully received Small Refiner Bias Entitlements (ERA Docket No. N00S90197) in April
and May 1977. These alleged violations of DOE crude oil regulations by Western were settled by a Consent Order between
the firm and DOE on May 30, 1984. The PRO was therefore withdrawn and the NOPV was rescinded. Western agreed to remit
$300,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Western has complied with
this obligation, remitting a total of $390,059.12 to the DOE. In return, the DOE has released Western from any liability
regarding its failure to comply with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period August
19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, with the sole exception of any potential violations of the Entitlements Program
after September 30, 1980.

Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., and Gibson Oil and Refining Company, were all controlled
by Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels during the price controls period. Textual references to ``Western'' in this Decision
include all parties to the consent order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gray was also a crude oil reseller during the period of price controls. On March 29, 1982, Gray and the DOE entered into
a Consent Order whereby Gray would remit $31,500, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow
account. The DOE agreed not to pursue its claim that, during the period March 1977 through January 1980, Gray overcharged
its customers by charging unlawfully high prices for crude oil in violation of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L.
Despite its agreement with the terms of the Consent Order, Gray failed to comply fully with its financial obligations
to the DOE, and remitted only $4,738.86 to the DOE. On October 15, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Texas, Amarillo Division, granted the DOE an Amended Judgment against Gray for an additional $34,625. However,
the Amended Judgment has not resulted in any additional payments to DOE by Gray. ERA has petitioned that the $4,738.86,
plus accrued interest, obtained from Gray be distributed by OHA in accordance with the Subpart V regulations.

Valentine was engaged in crude oil reclamation during the period May 1979 through December 1980.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Through an unincorporated subsidiary, Big Muddy Oil Processors Inc. (Big Muddy), Valentine obtained waste crude
oil from oil spills, pipeline ruptures, waste oil pits and oil tank bottoms. After numerous separation and filtering
processes, the waste oil was mixed with various blending agents (naphthas, natural gasoline, natural gas by-products,
etc.) and the resulting product was sold as pipeline-quality crude oil. Big Muddy, and by extension Valentine, was
therefore a reseller of crude oil, subject to the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L, which governed the resales
of crude oil.

William Valentine and Sons, Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ERA audit uncovered evidence that Valentine sold crude oil at unlawfully high prices during the period May 1979
through December 1980. On December 2, 1987, OHA issued a Remedial Order to Valentine directing the firm to refund $1,454,876
in overcharges, plus interest.

See William Valentine and Sons, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16 DOE &para;83,025 (1987). Valentine appealed OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). On March 23, 1989, FERC rejected Valentine's Appeal of the Remedial Order and upheld OHA's findings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See William Valentine and Sons, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
46 FERC &para;61,252 (1989). Valentine appealed that decision and, on January 24, 1990, the U.S. District Court for
the District of Wyoming ruled that Valentine's challenge to DOE's Remedial Order and to FERC's ruling was without
merit. At the same time, the Court also approved a Settlement Agreement in which Valentine agreed to remit to DOE no
less than $108,739 plus interest. In return, DOE agreed to deem Valentine in full compliance with the price control
program and to release all administrative and civil claims against the firm. Valentine has paid $126,402.66 into
an interest-bearing DOE escrow account in compliance with the Settlement Agreement.

II. Jurisdiction and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges,
51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986) (The MSRP). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement
(the Stripper Well Agreement) in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
M.D.L. No. 378 (D.Kan. 1986), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will be divided among the states, the federal
government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to twenty percent of these crude
oil overcharge funds will be reserved to satisfy valid claims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty
percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states
and federal government for indirect restitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly after the issuance of the MSRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the MSRP in all
Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August
20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing
refund applications in crude oil refund proceedings. On April 6, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous
comments and setting forth generalized procedures to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil
monies under the Subpart V regulations. 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April Notice).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April Notice,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various states filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that
the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly
calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Frank G. Theis issued an Opinion
and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). Judge Theis concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the]
OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling
them to a refund.''

at 1323. He also ruled that, as specified in the April Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portion of the
M.D.L. 378 overcharges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in
10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify
the persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the
amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the
OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see

Office of Enforcement,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981). After reviewing the records submitted in support of the three Petitions, we have concluded
that a Subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the $521,200.64 in funds obtained from Western,
Gray and Valentine. We therefore propose to grant the ERA's Petitions and assume jurisdiction over distribution
of the funds.

subject of the present determination. As noted above, the monies deposited with the DOE in settlement of the alleged
crude oil violations totalling $521,200.64, plus accrued interest, are covered by this Proposed Decision. We have
decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $104,240.13 plus interest,
for direct refunds to claimants, in order to insure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the
process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined
products.

E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 14 DOE &para;85,475 (1986). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes
of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, we will presume
that an applicant incurred a crude oil overcharge in the purchase of a product if the product was either identified
as a covered product in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760, or if
the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller.

whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are
presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not
submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price
controls.

their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide
in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.

Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this
Proposed Decision, or $416,960.51, plus interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government,
for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in
each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained
in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and
reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Southeastern has developed the following proposed power marketing policy for its Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina
System of Projects pursuant to Notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 8, 1993, 58 FR 47273, and in accordance with Procedure for Public Participation in the Formulation of
Marketing Policy published July 6, 1978, 43 FR 29186. In the Notice, Southeastern proposed a System Policy which would
deal with the complete Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects including systems both east and west of
the Savannah River. Based on analysis of proposals and recommendations received, consultations with interested
parties and further studies and considerations, Southeastern decided to develop a policy applying to the system
effective with the expiration of existing contracts, or as soon thereafter as is practical. The policy, when finalized,
will constitute written guidelines for future disposition of power from the system. The policy is developed under
authority of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s, and Section 302(a) of the Department of Energy
Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7152. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments directly to Southeastern
and/or present written or oral views, or data at the public comment forums on the proposed policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Southeastern received only one response to its September 8, 1993, solicitation for proposed and recommendations
contained in its Notice of Intent to Formulate Power Marketing Policy. This response was carefully considered as
were facts gathered from those who consulted with Southeastern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Major issues raised by the proposed policy are determination of marketing area, allocation of power among area customers,
handling of energy at pump-storage installations, utilization of area utility systems for power integration, firming,
wheeling, exchange and other essential relationships, wholesale rates, handling of resale relationships, and
conservation measures. An Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact have been prepared indicating
that the proposed power marketing policy will not have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment.
A copy may be obtained by contacting the Administrator at the address or telephone number listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment forums will not be adjudicative in nature. The Administrator shall act as or appoint a forum chairman.
At the start of the forums the chairman shall briefly explain procedures and rules. Customers and the public shall
be allowed to make oral statements and comments, introduce relevant documents, and ask questions regarding the proposed
power marketing policy of Southeastern representatives at the forum. Persons requesting to speak shall notify Southeastern
at which forum or forums they desire to speak at least 3 days before the particular forum is scheduled so that a list of
forum participants can be prepared. If necessary, the chairman may establish time limitations for oral presentations
by these participants to assure that all who register to speak shall have an opportunity to do so. Others will be permitted
to speak if time allows. Those unable to speak because of time limitations and others who so desire may submit written
comments. The chairman and Southeastern representatives may question forum participants and, the chairman, at
his discretion, may permit other participants a like privilege. Questions not answered by Southeastern representatives
during a forum shall be specifically identified by the chairman in the transcript and shall be subsequently responded
to by Southeastern in writing. All documents introduced and written answers to questions shall be available for inspection
and copying at Southeastern headquarters in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Forum proceedings shall
be transcribed. Copies of the transcript may be purchased from the reporter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customers and the public may consult or file written comments and questions with Southeastern regarding the proposed
marketing policy on or before September 16, 1994. All such questions shall receive expeditious response, September
16, 1994. All such questions shall receive expeditious response, and all such comments, questions and answers shall
be available at Southeastern headquarters for inspection or copying in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act. The forum transcripts will likewise be available for inspection at Southeastern headquarters in Elberton,
Georgia.

It will become effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and will be applicable to the sale of system power in respective utility areas as then existing contracts, or necessary
extensions, expire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy will be implemented through negotiated contracts for terms not to exceed 10 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transmission facilities owned by utilities within the marketing area will be used for all necessary purposes including
transmitting power to load centers. Deliveries may be made at the projects, at utilities' interconnections or at
customer substations, as determined by Southeastern. The projects will be hydraulically, electrically, and financially
integrated, and will be operated to make maximum contribution to the power supply of the selected utility areas. Preference
in the sale of the power shall be given to public bodies and cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing Area. The marketing area shall consist of the approximate 112,000 square mile area generally known as The
Southern Company service area, and the approximate 40,000 square mile area generally known as the service areas of
the South Carolina Public Service Authority and the South Carolina Electric and Gas Company plus that portion of the
Duke Power Company's service area within a radius of 150 miles of the Hartwell, Russell or Thurmond projects. Eligible
public bodies and cooperatives in this marketing area are listed in Appendix A attached hereto. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocations of Existing Power. Existing power available under this policy for allocation from the Georgia-Alabama-South
Carolina System will primarily be peaking power. The power will be allocated as follows:

Except where duplication of allocation would result, each public body and cooperative within the marketing areas
as shown in Appendix A will be eligible for an allocation of existing power, except for the City of Oxford, Georgia.
No reallocation of existing power for the benefit of Oxford is proposed at this time. Existing preference customers
within the marketing area will retain their present allocations of capacity and essentially the same energy accompaniment.
It is Southeastern's goal to allocate all available and useful system power (that power remaining after provision
for an appropriate capacity margin and losses) to preference customers, except power that may be used for pumping.

of these tests. The environmental tests and schedules were agreed upon by the Corps of Engineers and the party litigants,
and the results of the tests must be approved by the district court before the units become commercially available.
Should pumped storage units at the Russell project become commercially available during the tenure of contracts
implementing this policy, after the approval of the district court, after further mitigating modifications required
by environmental concerns, or by any other means, Southeastern will allocate this additional power as detailed in

. The capacity relative to the Russell pumped storage units will be allocated to the City of Oxford, Georgia, and to
the existing customers in The Southern Company service area including Alabama Electric Cooperative and South Mississippi
Electric Power Association (130 MW), the Duke Power Company service area (65 MW), the South Carolina Electric and
Gas service area (5 MW) and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (60 MW). Adequate capacity has been retained
to provide an appropriate capacity margin. Russell pumped storage capacity is predicted a this time on testing accomplished
to date and reflects the best estimate at this time. Energy accompaniment to the pumped storage capacity will be sufficient
to provide viable peaking capacity. The Russell pumped storage power will be allocated as follows:

Power From Pumped Water. Southeastern will utilize its combination pumped storage and generation resources to produce
high-value on-peak power. Pumping power, whether generated within the system of projects or obtained by purchasing
or exchange agreement, will be used in pumped storage operations, at Southeastern's discretion. Should the purchase
alternative be selected, Southeastern will obtain pumping energy from utilities offering the best terms, and/or
resulting in the most benefits to the system. Should the exchange alternative be selected, pumped storage operations
will be handled with public bodies, cooperatives and the utilities in a manner not involving the direct purchase and
sales approach, with preference given to public bodies and cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Utilization Of Utility Systems. In the absence of transmission facilities of its own, Southeastern will use area
generation and transmission systems to integrate the Government's projects, provide firming, wheeling, exchange
and backup services and such other functions as may be necessary to dispose of system power under reasonable and acceptable
marketing arrangements. Utility systems providing such services shall be entitled to adequate compensation. Specific
terms and conditions of all such arrangements shall be the subject of negotiations between Southeastern and the generation
and transmission utilities providing the services. Individual preferred agencies directly affected by the negotiations
shall, through representatives selected at the outset of negotiations, be kept currently advised on the status and
progress of negotiations. Southeastern also will consult with and seek advice from these affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Wholesale Rates. Rate schedules shall be drawn to recover all costs associated with producing and transmitting the
power in accordance with then current repayment criteria. Production costs will be determined on a system basis and
rate schedules will relate to the integrated output of the projects. Rate schedules may be revised periodically.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Resale Rates. Resale rate provisions requiring the benefits of Southeastern power to be passed on to the ultimate
consumer will be included in each Southeastern customer contract that provides for Southeastern to supply more than
25 percent of the customers' total power requirements during the term of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Energy and Economic Efficiency Measures. Each customer who purchases Southeastern's power is encouraged to participate
in an integrated resource plan that considers both supply and demand side alternatives. It is recognized that some
Southeastern customers are members of a power supply organization that does resource planning for its customers
(i.e., power supply cooperatives and joint action agencies). Where a customer, or a power supply organization that
does resource planning for a Southeastern customer, is responsible to a regulatory body or another Government agency
for an integrated resource plan, the customer will make a copy of such integrated resource plan available to Southeastern.
All Southeastern customers shall agree to encourage the efficient use of energy by ultimate customers.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In December 1993, Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposed to change the way it markets power and energy
produced by the Provo River Project (PRP) and to include it as one of the Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated
Projects). During the comment period on the proposal, comments were received which indicated that customers of Western's
Integrated Projects would not support inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. Western has decided to modify
its original proposal to market this power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Capacity and energy
produced by the PRP will be allocated to those members of Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah
Municipal Power Agency (UMPA) located in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. ICPA and UMPA are hereafter referred to
as potential contractors. Power would be allocated to these potential contractors proportional to their load. Separate
power sales contracts would be offered to the potential contractors. Potential contractors would pay all of the annual
powerplant expenses of the PRP including an amount to assist the Provo River Water Users Association (Water Users)
repayment of the United States original investment in the PRP. In return, potential contractors would receive all
of the marketable output of the PRP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice dated December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65180&hyph;65181), Western proposed to include the PRP with the Integrated
Projects and to market the power and energy produced by the PRP to members of ICPA and UMPA within a marketing area comprised
of Utah and Wasatch Counties, Utah. Western accepted comments on its proposal until January 12, 1994. A public information/comment/scoping
meeting was held in Spanish Fork, Utah, on January 4, 1994. As a result of comments received, at both the meeting and
in writing, Western is revising its proposed marketing plan for the PRP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the commentors, the Colorado River Energy Distributor's Association (CREDA), an organization of many Integrated
Projects customers, commented that CREDA believes ``the same principles commonly used in other Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) water projects having power generation features should be applied to the extent lawful in the instance
of PRP.'' Western's review of the appropriate laws shows that construction of the PRP and the methods of repaying the
United States for its investment in the project were first established in 1936, under Contract No. Ilr-874 dated June
27, 1936 (1936 Contract). The 1936 Contract states that surplus revenue from the sale of surplus water and power shall
be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water Users. No distinction was made in the contract that this payment
was to be for irrigation investment or for investment beyond the irrigators' ability to pay as is common in other Reclamation
projects. In fact, from the beginning, almost three-fourths of the water developed by the project was for municipal
and industrial use. Western has agreed to pay from power revenues $1.623 million toward the Water Users' obligation
by 2008. Of this amount, $191,587 has been paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CREDA also stated that it did not believe Western had adequately supported the need to integrate the projects. When
Western established the Integrated Projects in 1986, it intended to include the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP),
the Collbran Project, the Rio Grande Project, and the PRP. The PRP was not included because of uncertainty associated
with commitments to the Water Users. Western's intent was to bring PRP into the Integrated Projects on an equal basis
with the rest of the projects. Western has agreed that it is not necessary to include the PRP in the Integrated Projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a further comment, CREDA objected to all Integrated Projects customers paying costs of the Water Users since these
constitute repayment of municipal and industrial water development costs. CREDA had no objection to marketing the
PRP resource to ICPA and UMPA under separate contracts from the Integrated Projects. In fact, ICPA and UMPA are both
members of CREDA. Western has determined that it can still meet its objectives of beneficially marketing the PRP through
separate contractual arrangements and has revised its proposal to do so. This will require development of power sales
contracts with potential contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the PRP has only been sold to Western's CRSP, a rate for the capacity and energy produced has never been developed.
A power repayment study (PRS) has been prepared each year to determine the revenues needed to meet project repayment,
including operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses. The CRSP purchased the energy produced by the PRP for
this amount. Western now proposes that the PRS still be used to identify the annual revenue requirements of the PRP.
Potential contractors would pay their proportional share of one-twelfth of the annual amount each month to Western.
In addition, the potential contractors would pay a total of $102,243.80 each year to Reclamation to be applied toward
the Water Users' payment obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other Integrated Projects customers in Utah, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (Weber Basin) and Bountiful
City Light and Power (Bountiful), operate generating plants on the Weber River. Both claimed when water is diverted
from the Weber River into the Provo River under existing agreements, they incur losses in generation and asked to be
compensated for these losses. Western has determined that the water diversions from the Weber River into the Provo
River were established before Weber Basin or Bountiful constructed generation on the Weber River. Neither entity
had a power right to the waters of the Weber River. PacifiCorp, which is compensated for generating losses, owned an
operating generating plant on the Weber River and held power rights to the flows of the river prior to the Provo River
diversion. Discussions with Reclamation and examination of Weber Basin and Bountiful contracts have confirmed
this position. Weber Basin and Bountiful are not entitled to an allocation of PRP power to compensate them for harm
caused by reduced flows in the Weber River because their plants have never been entitled to, or used, the diverted water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commentor, Reclamation, stated that the marketing criteria should consider arrangements for providing
assistance to the Water Users. Also, the amount of assistance should be included in the PRP power marketing contracts,
and arrangements made so that payment could be made directly to Reclamation on behalf of the Water Users during the
contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These issues are still subject to further discussions with the Water Users and Reclamation. However, Western has
committed to provide a means for annual payment to be made toward project repayment on behalf of the Water Users by the
power purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reclamation also noted that the amount of winter season surplus energy is affected by several factors, including
the agreement dated May 16, 1986, known as the Interim Operating Agreement of Deer Creek and Strawberry Exchange of
Bonneville Unit Water (Interim Operating Agreement), and future agreements on the operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle
Reservoirs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reclamation has made it clear that the Interim Operating Agreement and future agreements may severely impact the
amount of generation available from the PRP during the winter season. The Interim Operating Agreement anticipated
that compensation to PacifiCorp, for energy lost when water is diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River,
would be affected and it provided a remedy. However, the Interim Operating Agreement does not address compensation
to the Water Users by Central Utah Water Conservancy District (Central Utah) for other winter season generation which
would be lost. Draft language on an agreement for joint operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle Reservoirs provides
a means for Central Utah to compensate the Water Users for this reduction. Drafts of this agreement stipulate that
a separate agreement among Central Utah, the Water Users, Western, PacifiCorp, and Reclamation will be developed
to provide for this compensation. It is anticipated that this agreement will be completed prior to initial service
under Western's proposed marketing plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Water Users commented that Western's criteria for marketing the surplus power and energy of the Deer Creek Powerplant
must fairly compensate the Water Users for the value of the surplus electric power and energy in the form of assistance
on its repayment obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western's criteria specify that the annual revenue requirements, including Western's commitment to the Water Users,
will be recovered from the potential contractors in return for all of the marketable power and energy produced by the
PRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Water Users further commented that the rate for nonfirm energy should be the same as the blended rate of firm energy.
Western's revised proposal would eliminate any distinction between firm and nonfirm energy. All energy produced
by the PRP would be delivered in return for the potential contractors paying all of the PRP's annual powerplant expenses.

All of the Water Users' comments are concerned with their claim to a contractual obligation that surplus revenue from
the sale of power be applied toward the repayment obligation of the Water Users for the PRP. Western has stated that
it will consider $1.623 million by 2008 as a repayment assistance to the PRP. The Water Users assert that there is an
obligation to develop surplus revenue from power sales that can be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water
Users beyond 2008 until all repayment obligations have been met. Western knows of no legal basis for the Water Users'
position. Resolution of these issues are outside the scope of this proposed action. These issues have been the focus
of several meetings between the Water Users, Western, and Reclamation. Western's proposal would provide a means
to ensure that the balance of the $1.623 million commitment is paid in annual increments by 2008.

Other Issues

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UMPA states that use of PRP energy in Utah County, Utah, will result in reduced reliance on fossil fuels and will enhance
the environment, especially air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue will be addressed in the environmental assessment which will be done on the proposed action. However, because
of the quantities of energy involved in the proposal, it is unlikely that the action will have a significant impact
on air quality in Utah County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Stonefly Society (Society), a local environmental organization, commented that operation of the PRP on the Provo,
Duchesne, and Weber Rivers has produced devastating impacts on these river systems. Among these are: (1) Destruction
of the Provo's natural channel and riparian areas, (2) anoxic water discharge from Deer Creek Reservoir, (3) dewatering
of the Weber River, and (4) dewatering of the Duchesne River. They state that three actions should be taken: (1) studies
of the environmental impacts of the PRP should be conducted immediately; (2) funds should be allocated from Deer Creek
Power revenues to correct these serious problems; and (3) no funds should be allocated to the PRP until these environmental
impacts have been both assessed and corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western's proposal is to only change the way power from the PRP is marketed. It will have no effect on how the PRP is operated.
The Society's issues are concerned with the way the project is operated and not on how power is marketed. Therefore,
their comments are outside the scope of this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Society asked ``if the PRP were included in the Integrated Projects, will the powerplant at Deer Creek Reservoir
be operated independently or will the operation be integrated with other Western generating facilities? If its operation
is integrated, will there be environmental impacts at these other facilities?'' Western's proposal is to market
the PRP independently of the Integrated Projects. There would be no operation connection between the projects. Furthermore,
since Deer Creek Powerplant is not controlled by Western, delivery of power and energy to the customer would be, as
always, on a run-of-the-river basis.

Congress granted to the Secretary of Energy acting by and through Western's Administrator the authority to market
Federal power. In response to requests from UMPA and ICPA to receive power produced by the PRP, Western has examined
the merits of reorganizing the marketing of the PRP resource. Western believes these proposed marketing changes
will benefit both the potential contractors and the Water Users.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A contract among Reclamation, the Water Users, the Weber River Water Users Association, and PacifiCorp dated December
20, 1938 (1938 Contract), provides for diversion of water from the Weber River into the Provo River for storage in Deer
Creek Reservoir and for use by the Water Users. Because PacifiCorp operated generating units on the Weber River below
the point of diversion to the Provo River, PacifiCorp's ability to generate was reduced when water was diverted. The
1938 Contract provides that PacifiCorp is to receive all of the electrical generation of the PRP during the period
of time that water is diverted. This means that for up to 6 months, from October 15 to April 15 of each year, there may be
no marketable energy generated by the PRP. Historically however, marketable energy has averaged 23,000,000 kilowatthours
(kWh), with 15,000,000 kWh generated during summer months, and the remaining 8,000,000 kWh from winter surplus energy.
Typically, about 3,000,000 kWh are available in each of the 3 peak summer months of June, July, and August; approximately
1,000,000 kWh are available in April; 2,500,000 kWh in May; and another 2,500,000 kWh in September. ICPA and UMPA would
receive all of the marketable energy generated by the PRP each year in return for paying all of the PRP powerplant expenses.

Because of the size of the resource, Western proposes to limit the marketing of this resource to preference entities
within the drainage area of the Provo River. All eligible utilities are members of ICPA and UMPA, and are located in
Utah and Wasatch Counties. Members of ICPA are the cities of Heber City, Lehi, Payson, Springville, and the Strawberry
Electric Service District (Strawberry). Affected members of UMPA are the cities of Provo, Salem, and Spanish Fork.
It is anticipated that marketing of the PRP resource to these potential contractors would assure that each would receive
a beneficial amount of power.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PRP generation is dependent upon water releases that are dictated by minimum stream flow requirements and the Water
Users' needs. No load following ability exists. Since April 1, 1994, the PRP has been included in Western's Upper Colorado
Missouri Basin control area. With the PRP in Western's control area, Western is able to enhance the usability of the
product and to allow it to be scheduled, even though it has no control over PRP generation. Western provides control
area and regulating services for several other customers and has a developed methodology to share the expenses of
operating a control area and providing for regulating capacity. Under the revised proposal, the PRP would be required
to pay for its share of these services. These costs will be included in the PRS as an operating expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy will be scheduled to the potential contractors in megawatts in accordance with anticipated generation levels
from the PRP. When variations occur, the hourly schedules will be adjusted to reflect actual operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western will maintain an energy deviation account between the PRP and the Integrated Projects. At the end of each year,
an accounting of scheduled and generated energy will be made. Differences between the two projects will be made up
by adding to or subtracting from the following year's schedules to the potential contractors. The potential contractors
will be responsible for reserves in accordance with Inland Power Pool requirements.

e. Resource Allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western proposes to allocate PRP resources in proportion to the historical sales of each of the ICPA and UMPA members.
UMPA members serve approximately 70 percent of the load in the marketing area, and the city of Provo is by far the largest
member. ICPA members serve approximately 30 percent of the marketing area load. Proportional allocation of the PRP's
average annual output of 23,000,000 kWh would mean UMPA members could expect an average of 16,100,000 kWh and 3,500
kilowatts (kW) of contingent capacity, and ICPA members could expect an average of 6,900,000 kWh and 1,500 kW of contingent
capacity. Of ICPA members' 30 percent, Heber City would receive 6 percent, Lehi 2.7 percent, Springville 12.9 percent,
Payson 4.8 percent, and Strawberry 3.6 percent. Of UMPA members' 70 percent, Provo would receive 60.9 percent, Salem
1.4 percent, and Spanish Fork 7.7 percent. Western would develop firm power sales contracts with ICPA and UMPA on behalf
of their members which would specify the terms and conditions of receiving PRP power. The power sales contracts would
be structured such that if a member withdraws from either ICPA or UMPA, it would be able to retain its entitlement of
PRP power.

f. Contract Terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ICPA and UMPA would pay the PRP's total annual powerplant expenses in return for the total marketable PRP production.
Each would pay its proportional share of the operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses identified in the
PRS in 12 monthly installments. In addition, before January 1 of each year, ICPA would pay $30,685.71 and UMPA $71,600.00
to Reclamation to be applied toward the Water Users annual payment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The power sales contracts would become effective on October 1, 1994, and terminate on September 30, 2008.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western will accept comments on its proposed revised marketing plan until August 10, 1994. Following this comment
period, Western will prepare the appropriate contracts and other agreements that may be necessary to implement its
proposal. A notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will announce Western's final decisions on marketing PRP power. The marketing plan will be effective 30 days following
publication of that notice. Western intends to begin initial service under these contracts on October 1, 1994.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Western will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 through preparation of an environmental assessment
(EA) on the impacts of the proposed marketing changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western has no operational control over the PRP. Deer Creek Dam is operated primarily for the benefit of water storage
and delivery. Power production is a secondary benefit and does not influence dam operations in any manner. Therefore,
the proposed PRP marketing changes will have no effect on dam operations.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), each agency, when publishing a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment
an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined
that: (1) This rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of
the Act, and (2) the impacts of an allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities.

DETERMINATION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order
12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly,
no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required.

Test samplers representative of this method have been tested by the applicant, in accordance with the test procedures
specified in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submitted by the applicant,
EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this method should be designated as a reference method. The information
submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with
40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a designated reference method, this method is acceptable for use by States and other air monitoring agencies under
requirements of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes, the method must be used in accordance
with the guidance in appendix J to 40 CFR part 50 and the specific procedures contained in the operation or instruction
manual associated with the method. Use of the method is also subject to any limitations specified in the applicable
designation (see description of the method above). Vendor modifications of a designated method used for purposes
of part 58 are permitted only with prior approval of EPA, as provided in part 53. Provisions concerning modification
of such methods by users are specified under section 2.8 of appendix C to 40 CFR part 58 (Modifications of Methods by
Users).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, this designation applies to any sampler which is identical to the sampler described in the designation.
Similar samplers manufactured and sold prior to the designation may be upgraded (e.g., by minor modification or by
substitution of a new operation or instruction manual) so as to be identical to the designated method and thus achieve
designation status at a modest cost. The manufacturer should be consulted to determine the feasibility of such upgrading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 53 requires that sellers of designated methods comply with certain conditions. These conditions are given in

 EPA's grant regulations (40 CFR 35.150) require the Agency to conduct yearly performance evaluations on the progress
of the approved State/EPA Agreements. EPA's regulations (40 CFR 56.7) require that the Agency make available to the
public the evaluation reports. EPA has conducted evaluations on the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Nebraska
Department of Environmental Quality, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and Kansas Department of Health and
Environment. These evaluations were conducted to assess the agencies' performance under the grants made to them
by EPA pursuant to section 105 of the Clean Air Act.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(r)(10) of the Clean Air Act directs the President to conduct a review of release prevention, mitigation,
and response authorities across the Federal government. The Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with
the other member agencies of the Federal National Response Team (NRT), conducted the review and submitted its report
to the Congress in February 1994. The report concludes that while the current hazardous materials safety system achieves
its statutory goals to protect public health and safety and the environment, it is overly complex and confusing and,
as a result, imposes unnecessary costs on government, industry, and the public. To address these issues and to consider
appropriate remedies, the report proposes a second phase involving stakeholder participation that will focus on:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Streamlining the multiple and overlapping statutory terms for regulated substances and reportable events,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Harmonizing multiple and/or redundant hazard classification systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Analyzing the efficacy of multiple requirements for facility contingency plans and the desirability of a
Federal baseline standard with added components for special concerns, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Streamlining accident data collection and management systems to improve efficiency, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Improving Federal/state/local coordination of emergency planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goal of the second phase of the project is to identify specific administrative and statutory changes that will
yield a more coordinated, rational, and efficient approach to hazardous materials safety. The period provided under
this notice for statements is designed to provide an opportunity for interested parties to have input into this process
and help shape any potential recommendations.

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised federal MSWLF criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility.

Florida applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Florida's application and
proposed a determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF
criteria. After consideration of all comments received, EPA is today issuing a final determination that the State's
program is adequate.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the federal criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised federal criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.

B. State of Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 20, 1993, Florida submitted an application for adequacy determination for their municipal solid waste landfill
permit program. On March 2, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Florida's
program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 9980&hyph;9983 (March 2,
1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and
a public hearing which was held by EPA_Region IV on April 25, 1994, in Tallahassee, Florida. The public comment period,
which originally ended on April 25, 1994, was extended an additional seven (7) days because of public interest. Comments
were accepted on the tentative determination through close of business on May 2, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Region IV received written and oral comments during the public comment period and public hearing on the tentative
determination of adequacy for Florida. In addition to comments supporting EPA's determination, several issues
and concerns were raised, which are outlined and responded to below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Liner design_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following issues regarding Florida's
liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills: (1) Florida fails to require adequate liner design criteria which
complies with minimum federal requirements and that would reduce leaks and improve leak detection capabilities,
(2) Florida's liner designs contemplate the allowance of a double geomembrane liner without a low permeable clay
component, (3) many of the assumptions that Florida made in their required MuitiMed modelling efforts were not actually
indicative of conditions in Florida or did not present actual ``worst-case'' conditions, as is required when states
submit alternative liner designs for EPA review, and (4) Florida's liner design demonstration was based on a point
of compliance nearly 500 feet from the landfill boundary (almost five (5) times the distance allowed by state law).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA was charged with reviewing state municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs to determine if they meet
the standards presently set forth in the federal criteria for municipal solid waste landfills, which are found at
parts 257 and 258 of Chapter 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 257 and 258). Florida's regulations incorporate
ten (10) liner designs to be used in landfills in the state. Nine (9) of the liner designs are single composite systems
which incorporate_from top to bottom_a leachate collection system, a flexible synthetic membrane and a layer of
compacted soil (the federal standard liner system is also a composite requiring the same components, in the same order).
The tenth of Florida's designs is a double liner system, which incorporates_from top to bottom_a leachate collection
system, a flexible synthetic membrane, a second leachate collection/detection system, a second flexible synthetic
membrane and a layer of compacted soil. The state of Florida has presented information to satisfactorily demonstrate
that each of the liner systems prescribed in their regulations will meet the federal performance standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA performed an extensive review of Florida's liner requirements and found them to be comparable to the federal criteria
at 40 CFR part 258. In addition, EPA Region IV retained an independent contractor to evaluate Florida's liner systems
and conferred with an EPA landfill liner expert. After thorough review of all submitted information, the contractor
also found Florida's liner systems to be comparable to the federal criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's expert was called upon in the matter of Florida's assumption of 1 cm2/acre defect density in the flexible membrane
portion(s) of their liner system. According to the EPA expert, with appropriate quality assurance/quality control
(QA/QC) during installation of the flexible membranes, the referenced defect density is achievable and has been
extensively documented. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 contain no specific QA/QC provisions. It is assumed
that QA/QC will be ensured prior to disposal of wastes in landfill units. As Florida's QA/QC requirements are quite
extensive and as it is the state alternative liner designs and not QA/QC that is being evaluated for comparability,
it is appropriate to assume that Florida will ensure that QA/QC requirements are met during installation of municipal
solid waste landfill liner systems in their state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the distance that Florida used for the point of compliance in their modelling, states must demonstrate
to EPA that proposed alternatives meet federal performance standards. The federal performance standard for liner
designs is that maximum concentration limits (MCLs) for listed constituents not be exceeded in the uppermost aquifer
at the point of compliance, which must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately
500 feet of the landfill unit boundary). Although Florida requires that MCLs not be exceeded at a maximum distance
of 100 feet (which is more restrictive than the federal criteria), utilization of the 500 foot distance is appropriate
for Florida's demonstration that their requirements meet the federal performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Authority for and implications of approving alternative liner designs in Florida_Comments were received during
the public comment period questioning whether EPA is authorized to allow statewide alternative liner designs and
stating that Region IV's decision on Florida's liner designs will have national implications based on the presumption
that any alternative liner design that EPA approves for Florida must likewise be approved in other states, ``given
Florida's extreme vulnerability to groundwater pollution.'' EPA Headquarters has addressed the issue of EPA's
authority to approve statewide alternative liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills. After review of 40
CFR part 258, the preamble to part 258 and EPA Headquarters training materials on the implementation of part 258, EPA
Headquarters prepared a memorandum which concluded that the flexibility afforded to an approved State/Tribe allows
the application of an alternative liner design on a State/Tribal-wide basis so long as that design meets the performance
standard in all locations throughout the State/Tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the presumption that alternatives approved for Florida will have to be approved for other states, the State/Tribal
adequacy review process requires EPA to evaluate each state's municipal solid waste landfill permit program based
on the specifics of individual state requirements. Proposed alternatives to any of the federal standards are only
to be accepted if the state demonstrates that the alternative(s) would meet federal performance standards. States
proposing alternative liner designs are required to present data from analysis via the MultiMed fate and transport
model, which requires information that can only be expressed based on particular state conditions (eg., precipitation,
hydrologic conditions, etc.). EPA's decision to approve or disapprove a state's alternative liner design weighs
heavily on the results of this state-specific modelling. Therefore, approval of an alternative liner design in one
state would not automatically make the same liner approvable in another state.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Groundwater/Drinking Water_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following concerns
regarding the effects of municipal solid waste landfills on groundwater and drinking water in the State of Florida:
(1) Florida's present municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately protect high quality groundwater
and the State should prohibit landfills from being located in sensitive areas, such as above underground sources
of drinking water, and (2) there is the possibility of leachate discharges from municipal solid waste landfills contaminating
drinking water wells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The federal criteria require that groundwater be monitored for constituents at a distance no more than 150 meters
(approximately 500 feet) from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property boundary, whichever
is less. The point at which groundwater is monitored is to be chosen considering several factors, one of which is whether
the groundwater is used for drinking water. Florida's program meets these standards. Florida has made revisions
to their requirements to include all of the contaminants for which the federal standards require monitoring. Florida
also requires periodic sampling of leachate generated by the landfill to determine which contaminants would be of
concern in the event of a release to the subsurface. This analysis is not required by the federal criteria. Further,
as previously mentioned, Florida requires monitoring of groundwater and corrective action if groundwater is found
to be contaminated at a distance not to exceed 100 feet from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property
boundary, whichever is less. Again, Florida's 100 foot distance is more stringent than the federal criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding landfills being sited in the vicinity of drinking water intakes, the federal criteria for locating municipal
solid waste landfills are very general and include restrictions (but not necessarily prohibitions) to locating
municipal solid waste landfills in floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas and
areas in close vicinity to airports. The State of Florida's regulations have been deemed adequate in that they meet
the minimum federal requirements. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 do not address drinking water intakes with
respect to locating landfills. Further, EPA cannot 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
require
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Florida to adopt more stringent requirements to receive approval of their program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Health/Risk Assessment_Comments were received during the public comment period presenting the concern that
Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately assess the adverse impact on human health
resulting from exposure to landfill leachate in drinking water. It was suggested that Florida be required to evaluate
human health effects from chronic exposure to contaminants released from municipal solid waste. Addressing this
issue was beyond the scope of EPA's review of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting program. However,
the types of complex health studies that are referenced are generally conducted as research projects by organizations
and health scientists trained in this field. Such work is ongoing in federally-funded laboratories, universities
and other research organizations. On occasion, these studies are conducted in community populations that are known
to have been exposed to environmental contaminants over an extended period of time and that claim to have a high level
of health problems believed to be associated with the contamination. With the multiple stresses and health problems
that typically exist in a community, it is extremely difficult to prove a causal association with a specific environmental
exposure. Such health studies are complex, difficult to interpret and often inconclusive. Therefore, a requirement
for health evaluations are not typically included, per se, in regulatory permit programs but rather these programs
use toxicity and risk assessment information to develop the technical permit requirements that would be health protective.
Florida's municipal solid waste landfill program was developed in a manner which satisfactorily meets the above
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Public Participation_Comments were received during the public comment period petitioning for ``corrective
action to redress inadequate public participation in development of Florida's Solid Waste Management Plan.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under EPA's rules for public participation, a state, in its development of rules for a Subtitle D program, has the option
of following the requirements of the state's administrative procedures act, if one exists. Florida does have an administrative
procedures act and the State complied with its requirements in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, Florida has
complied with EPA's rules for public participation. In addition, EPA has provided public participation opportunities
in its review of whether the Florida program is adequate when compared to the criteria of 40 CFR Part 258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Environmental Justice_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that there should
be an evaluation of the environmental justice implications of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting
rules prior to approval of Florida's program. There is concern that (1) Florida's program was ``developed with grossly
inadequate provisions for participation by persons most threatened by toxic pollution of their water supplies''
and (2) Florida's present program fails to provide equal protection to people obtaining drinking water from private
wells (low-income communities were specifically referenced).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Review of Florida's practices with respect to environmental justice was beyond the scope of this adequacy determination.
In an effort to address questions of environmental justice, EPA_Region IV established the Office of Environmental
Justice in 1993. In March 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive Order that is designed to focus federal attention
on the environmental and human health conditions in minority communities. EPA's primary objectives with respect
to environmental justice are: (a) ensure that all EPA Region IV environmental programs do not adversely impact minority
populations and persons living at or below the poverty level, (b) address complaints from communities regarding
subjection to a disproportionate burden of the pollution generated by industry and municipalities and (c) provide
for outreach programs that will bring minority communities, environmental groups, and government together on relevant
environmental issues. Guidelines for implementing these objectives and the requirements of the Executive Order
within EPA programs are presently being developed at the Regional and Headquarters levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Mandated Recycling_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that Florida be required
to mandate separation of recyclables and toxic contaminants from municipal solid waste prior to disposal in landfills.
The federal operating criteria for municipal solid waste landfills include procedures for excluding the receipt
of regulated hazardous waste, which require implementation of ``a program at the facility for detecting and preventing
the disposal of regulated hazardous wastes and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) wastes''. The state's program must
incorporate, at a minimum: random inspections of incoming loads, records of inspections, training facility personnel
to recognize prohibited wastes and notification of the proper authorities if a regulated hazardous waste or PCB is
discovered at the facility. Florida's program meets the federal requirements for exclusion of regulated hazardous
substances in municipal solid waste landfills. However, there presently are no federal regulations which mandate
recycling. Therefore, requiring separation of recyclables from municipal solid waste streams prior to disposal
is a decision which must be made on the state and/or local level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Florida's rules for municipal solid waste landfills are not enforceable at municipal solid waste landfills
located on Indian Lands in the State of Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the public comments, I conclude that Florida's application for adequacy determination meets all
of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted a determination
of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the federal criteria. See 56

FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's/Tribe's program are already in effect as a matter of State/Tribal
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply.
Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.

Needs and Uses: Part 69 of the Commission's rules and regulations establishes the rules for access charges for interstate
or foreign access provided by telephone companies on or after January 1, 1984. Part 69 essentially consists of rules
or the procedures for the computation of access charges which are not information collections as defined by 5 CFR 1320.
Any reporting or disclosure requirements occurs in connection with particular tariff filings with the FCC or other
state commissions or with records maintained in accordance to the Uniform Systems of Accounts (USOA). Section 69.3
requires the annual submission of access charge tariffs. Section 69.116(c) and 69.117(c) requires LECs to file information
with NECA semi-annually pertaining to the number of lines in their study areas and interexchange carriers to which
such lines are presubscribed. This information will be used by NECA to assess revenue requirements needed to fund
the Universal Service Fund and Lifeline Assistance Programs. Section 69.104(k)(1) requires that a state or local
telephone company wishing to implement an end user common line reduction or waiver for its subscribers file information
with the FCC demonstrating that its state lifeline assistance plan meets certain criteria. This is a one-time filing
requirement. Section 69.104(l) requires local telephone carriers to calculate for NECA their projected revenue
requirements for the lifeline assistance programs. Section 69.605 requires carriers who are participating in the
pool to report access revenues and cost data so that NECA may compute monthly pool revenues distributions. The information
is used by FCC staff to compute charges in tariffs for access service (or origination and termination) and to compute
revenue pool distributions. Neither process could be implemented without the information.

Since December 1987 state member banks that meet the shareholder and total asset criteria have been required pursuant
to Regulation H to file the same securities forms and reports that bank holding companies and non-bank entities use
when they file directly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some examples of such reports are Form 10&hyph;Q
quarterly reports, Form 10&hyph;K annual reports, and event-generated Form 3 and Form 4 reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A. Program Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Head Start is a national program providing comprehensive developmental services primarily to low-income preschool
children and their families. To help enrolled children achieve their full potential, Head Start programs provide
comprehensive health, nutritional, educational, social, and other services. In addition Head Start programs are
required to provide for the direct participation of the parents of enrolled children in the development, conduct,
and direction of local programs. Head Start currently serves approximately 713,000 children through a network of
approximately 1,395 grantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Head Start is targeted primarily toward children whose families have incomes at or below the poverty line or
who are eligible for public assistance, regulations permit up to 10 percent of the Head Start children in local programs
to be from families which do not meet these low-income criteria. Head Start regulations also require that a minimum
of 10 percent of enrollment opportunities in each program be made available to children with disabilities. Such children
are expected to be enrolled in the full range of Head Start services and activities in a mainstream setting with their
non-disabled peers, and to receive needed special education and related services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background on Demonstration Project ``A Head Start on Science'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The report from the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion emphasizes that quality services to Head
Start families must be given priority attention by all Head Start programs. The report underscored the need for staff
development and training and supports initiatives designed to increase staff understanding of concepts and principles
which will help them become more effective in early childhood settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project is designed to link colleges and universities to Head Start programs for the purpose of teaching science
to Head Start staff. Highly intensive, hands-on instruction will provide teachers, assistants, and home visitors
with exposure to the principles of science and increase their insights and skills regarding how to take their college
campus experience and create classroom environments which invite child exploration and discovery. The staff will
also increase their understanding of the natural learning environment presented by the out-of-doors, and the child's
own home. We expect that ``A Head Start on Science'' model will be developed and documented in suitable printed and
visual materials to be used to transmit the concept and approaches to other institutions of higher learning and Head
Start communities. Project funds may also be used to present and distribute information at appropriate regional
and national Head Start events, and to members of the Head Start training and technical assistance network. Also,
it would be appropriate for the grantee to develop strategies and products which will assist other local Head Start
programs to negotiate with their local college or university for similar staff training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that as a result of participating in ``A Head Start on Science'' demonstration project, Head Start teachers,
teacher assistants, and home visitors will be instrumental in creating a lifelong interest in science both for themselves
and for the children and families with whom they work. We believe that staff will be impacted by the knowledge that science
is found not only in a laboratory under a microscope, but in the everyday world in which they live. As a result of this
experience, teachers, assistants and home visitors' concepts of science and their own scientific abilities will
increase and in turn have a powerful effect on their ability to engage in discovery and establish environments in which
children and families may explore, discover and interpret scientific activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This announcement is soliciting applications from four-year colleges or universities, i.e., institutions of higher
learning that grant degrees. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although projects
periods may be for two years. Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year
budget period but within the two year project period will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive
basis, subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued
funding would be in the best interest of the Government. The Department of Health and Human Services will award one
grant under this announcement. Up to $550,000 will be available for a 24 month project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the first year of the grant, the grantee institution will use these funds to create, demonstrate and evaluate a summer
institute prototype on their campus during the summer of 1995 with follow-up assistance to Head Start staff graduates
as they implement their new skills at their local programs. Also in year one the grantee will recruit another college
or university in which to replicate the model in year two.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the second year of this grant, the grantee institution will improve the prototype program based on year-one experiences,
and will offer the hands-on science program to a new group of Head Start staff during the summer 1996. Also during the
second year, the ``A Head Start on Science'' grantee will fund for one year, and mentor another college or university
to: (1) implement the prototype ``A Head Start on Science'' model in the summer of 1996 and; (2) provide follow-up assistance
to the Head Start staff as they plan to implement their new skills in their local programs. The addition of a second institution
will provide the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness and transferability of the concept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the grant period, a third party evaluator must be secured by the grantee institution to assess the effectiveness
of the approach, content and transferability of the ``A Head Start on Science'' project. The third party evaluator
must not be involved in the conduct of the demonstration. The evaluation of the students in both institutes in the summer

D. Project Period and Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of approximately $550,000 in ACF funds will be available to fund the demonstration project for a 24 month period.
Applicants must propose how much will be needed for each 12 month period of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee must provide at least 20 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $550,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of approximately $275,000 per budget period) must provide
&sect;137,500 in cash or in-kind contributions (20% of total project costs of $687,500).

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, the Department is required to submit to OMB for
review and approval any reporting and record keeping requirements in regulations, including program announcements.
This program announcement does not contain information collection requirements beyond those approved for ACF grant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR
Part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
Executive Order 12372, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa, and Palau
have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs).
Applicants from these 19 jurisdictions areas need not take action regarding Executive Order 12372. Applications
for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are exempt from the requirements of Executive
Order 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective
application and to receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOC
as early as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is
imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal
(or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPOCs have 30 days from the application deadline date to comment on applications submitted under this announcement.
We are requesting a shortened period for SPOC review. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine
endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between
mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate
or explain'' rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W., 6th
floor, Aerospace Building, Washington, D.C. 20447. ACF will notify the State of any application received which has
no indication that the State process has had an opportunity for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of SPOCs for each State and territory is included at Appendix A at the end of this announcement.

This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a&hyph;k of Section B.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall purpose of the program is to work toward the ultimate goal of reducing exposures to hazardous substances
and mitigating potential adverse health effects from such exposures. Applications should describe how progress
toward this goal will be measured. This program will assist State health or environmental departments to identify,
develop, disseminate, and evaluate appropriate educational materials and programs on the potential health effects,
prevention, medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosis and treatment of injury or disease related
to exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. Special emphasis will be placed on exposures found at or near
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites, and other sites identified by ATSDR's Health Activities
Recommendation Panel (HARP). See Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP) below for a description of HARP.
(Superfund sites are defined as sites on, or proposed to be on, the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL)). HARP sites
include petitioned sites and consultation sites, in addition to NPL sites. A list of HARP-recommended sites will
be included with the application package. Following are definitions or descriptions of the activities to be performed:

Site-Specific Preventive Health Education_An activity designed to address health risks in a community where presenting
specific information or recommendations can assist the community in understanding, preventing, or mitigating
the health effects of hazardous substances exposure. Target audiences are community members and health professionals.
Preventive health education related to sites should be integral to the entire public health activities process and
not simply performed when all other activities are completed. Sites for health education should be selected based
on public health need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following describes the two types of site-specific preventive health education activities.

Community Health Education_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any activity or activities directed toward the community near a site, designed to assist the community in understanding
their potential for exposure or assessing adverse health occurrence in their community and to prevent or mitigate
exposure to hazardous substances. Activities may include disseminating written materials, presenting coordinated
programs involving on-site actions and site-specific materials development (prevention oriented), or supporting
an on site health educator. It is assumed that in community health education, community members are involved in the
assessment, policy development, and assurance phases of site-specific preventive health education.

General Environmental Health Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Up to 20% of health education efforts can be devoted to developing for health professionals general educational materials
and programs that may not be directly related to a site, but expand the base of knowledge in the area of environmental
health. Types of activities could include grand rounds, short courses, workshops, or curriculum development. Topics,
for example, could include materials or programs on: improving the knowledge and skills of health care providers
in determining potential hazardous substance exposure as an integral part of their patient workup (i.e., taking
exposure histories); environmental toxicology; environmental epidemiology; and health risk communication.
General environmental education activities must also be evaluated.

Applications are subject to the Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.)
12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications.
Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point
of Contacts (SPOCs) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and to receive any necessary
instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to
contact the SPOC for each affected State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any
State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Henry S. Cassell, III,
Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Atlanta, GA 30305, no later than 30 days after the application
deadline date. (A waiver for the 60-day requirement has been requested.) The granting agency does not guarantee to
``accommodate or explain'' State process recommendations it receives after that date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CERCLA as amended by SARA, provides for the recovery of costs incurred for response actions at each Superfund site
from potentially responsible parties. The recipient would agree to maintain an accounting system that will keep
an accurate, complete, and current accounting of all financial transactions on a site-specific basis, i.e., individual
time, travel, and associated cost including indirect cost, as appropriate for the site. The recipient would also
maintain documentation that describes the site-specific response actions taken with respect to the site, e.g.,
contracts, work assignments, progress reports, and other documents that describe the work performed at a site. The
recipient will retain the documents and records to support these financial transactions and documentation of work
performed, for possible use in a cost recovery case, for a minimum of ten (10) years after submission of a final Financial
Status Report (FSR), unless there is litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the specific
site, then the records will be maintained until resolution of all issues on the specific site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Project activities which are approved for contracting pursuant to the prior approval provisions shall be formalized
in a written agreement that clearly establishes the relationship between the recipient and the third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The written agreement shall at a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. State or incorporate by reference all applicable requirements imposed on the contractors under the terms of the
grant and/or cooperative agreement, including requirements concerning technical review (ATSDR selected reviewers),
ownership of data, and the arrangement for copyright when publications, data, or other copyrightable works are developed
under or in the course of work under a PHS grant-supported project or activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

license to the government to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use them, and to authorize others to do so for Federal
government purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. State that whenever any work subject to this copyright policy may be developed in the course of a grant by a contractor
under a grant, the written agreement (contract) must require the contractor to comply with these requirements and
can in no way diminish the government's right in that work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Great Lakes Human Health Effects Program is authorized under
section 106, Subsection 118(e) of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 [33 U.S.C. 1268(e)(3)], and Sections
104(i)(5)(A) and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)
as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(5)(A) and (15)].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in
consultation with ATSDR and the Great Lakes States, to initiate a research program and submit a report to Congress
assessing the harmful human health effects of water pollutants in the Great Lakes basin. The ATSDR Great Lakes Human
Health Effects Research Program focuses on populations that have been identified as having a higher risk of long-term
adverse health effects from exposure to Great Lakes contaminants in fish. They include Native Americans, sport anglers,
urban poor, and fetuses and nursing infants of mothers who consume contaminated Great Lakes fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1992, ATSDR awarded nine research grants designed to investigate and characterize the association between
the consumption of contaminated Great Lakes fish and potential long-term adverse health effects. The draft ATSDR
annual report for FY 1992 describes the Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program's strategy, and the research
activities and status of the nine awarded grants.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to enable State public health agencies to implement and evaluate priority
injury prevention and control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. Specifically, State public health agencies may submit applications to develop programs in EACH OR ANY
of six areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Prevention of bicycle-related head injuries through increased usage of bicycle helmets; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Prevention of fire-related burns through increased installation and utilization of smoke detectors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased usage of occupant protection, including seat belts, child
safety seats, and air bags; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identification of firearm-related injuries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Identification and prevention of violence against women; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Identification and prevention of alcohol-related injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs in any of these six areas will develop, implement, and evaluate targeted activities designed to accurately
measure and reduce morbidity, mortality, severity, disability, and costs associated with injuries. This funding
will allow the applicant to establish or strengthen a lead capacity for prevention and control of the targeted injury
(e.g., bicycle-related head injuries). It is expected that any program developed will function as a component of
the public health agency's injury control program, will coordinate related activities both within the agency and
within the jurisdiction, and will mobilize, seek input from, and utilize broad coalitions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a document entitled ``Anesthesia Apparatus
Checkout Recommendations, 1993.'' The document presents a general checkout and inspection procedure that should
be conducted before administration of an anesthesia to ensure that the anesthesia machine, patient breathing system,

 I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is committed to carrying out a program to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. One aspect
of this program involves regulatory activities under the laws administered by the agency concerning the design,
manufacture, and distribution of medical devices. Patient safety, however, is dependent on more than properly functioning
devices. Although proper operation, maintenance, and periodic inspection of these devices by the user are matters
that cannot always be addressed effectively through regulatory action under the laws administered by the agency,
they are essential to minimize risks to patients. Consequently, as an important adjunct to its regulatory program,
FDA has initiated a variety of educational efforts to aid medical professionals in the safe use of medical devices.
These educational endeavors are conducted in cooperation with, and usually with the active participation of, the
relevant professional organizations and other groups within the private sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, to reduce unnecessary retakes in radiology and to improve image quality, FDA, in cooperation with the
American College of Radiology and other private sector organizations, developed voluntary recommendations for
radiology facilities concerning equipment quality assurance programs (``A Basic Quality Assurance Program for
Small Diagnostic Radiology Facilities,'' FDA 83&hyph;8218). In cooperation with the American College of Radiology
and numerous other medical professional societies, FDA also fostered the development of guides for clinicians on
the effective use of selected diagnostic imaging procedures (``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations,''
FDA 80&hyph;8104; ``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations: The Pelvimetry Examination,'' FDA 81&hyph;8174;
``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations: Chest X-ray Screening and Examination,'' FDA 83&hyph;8204).
As an adjunct to the teaching of medical students and radiology residents, FDA funded the development of a basic teaching
system in radiology, ``The Radiological Health Sciences Learning File,'' which is now in use in radiology education
and is used in 118 medical schools in the United States and in several foreign medical schools as well. These examples
illustrate FDA's commitment to ensuring that users of medical devices are sufficiently educated and motivated to
use medical devices safely and effectively.

II. Scope of the 1993 Recommendations Document
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recommendations document that the agency is now making available a revised version of the draft document entitled
``Draft Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1992,'' that was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 6, 1992 (57 FR 46033), and that was based on the original document entitled ``Draft Anesthesia Apparatus
Checkout Recommendations,'' that was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 27, 1987 (52 FR 5583). FDA also intends to make this document available to anesthesia clinicians through
their professional organizations and to anesthesia equipment manufacturers so that they may include it in their
user education programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommendations in ``Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1993'' should be followed for anesthesia
systems that conform to current and relevant standards (such as ``Standard Specifications for Minimum Performance
and Safety Requirements for Components and Systems of Anesthesia Gas Machines,'' ASTM F&hyph;1161&hyph;88) and
that include an ascending bellows ventilator and at least the following monitors: Capnograph, pulse oximeter, oxygen
analyzer, respiratory volume monitor (spirometer) and breathing system pressure monitor with high and low pressure
alarms. However, the recommendations document offers guidance that users are encouraged to modify to accommodate
differences in equipment design and variations in local clinical practice. Such local modifications should have
appropriate peer review. The original recommendations document (52 FR 5583) should be followed for other anesthesia
systems. Users should refer to the operators manual for specific procedures and precautions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the draft document entitled ``Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1992'' (57 FR 46033),
eight comments were received and reviewed by the agency. Some minor refinements were made to the checkout recommendations
in response to the comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the pre-use inspection procedure provided in the checkout recommendations will aid medical professionals
in the safe use of anesthesia devices. FDA regards the pre-use inspection procedure to be a recommendation as defined
in &sect;10.90(c) (21 CFR 10.90(c)). Therefore, the checklist is being made available under &sect;10.90(c) of the
agency's administrative practices and procedures regulations. That regulation provides for FDA to formulate and
disseminate recommendations about matters that are authorized by, but do not involve direct regulatory action under,
the laws administered by the agency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued to the North Carolina
Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, University of North Carolina School
of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, for the manufacture of Source Plasma.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA conducted an inspection of the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory between July 30 and August 15, 1991. The inspection
documented serious deviations from the applicable Federal regulations and the biologics standards in the firm's
license. Deviations identified during the inspection included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) Failure
to adequately determine donor suitability, in that: (a) three donors who admitted to a history of hepatitis, liver
disease, or jaundice were regularly accepted for Source Plasma donation (21 CFR 640.63(c)(11)); (b) two donors who
previously tested repeatedly reactive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) continued to be accepted for donation,
despite having never met the established criteria for donor reentry as described in the December 2, 1987, FDA HBsAg
protocol (21 CFR 610.41); (c) two donors who failed to donate for a period of 6 months were not processed as new donors
(21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(iii)); and (d) five donors did not have serum protein electrophoresis testing performed every
4 months (21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(i)); (2) failure to limit the frequency of Source Plasma donation to two times within
a 7-day period, in that at least two donors were allowed to donate three times in a 7-day period (21 CFR 640.65(b)(5));
(3) failure to observe, standardize, and calibrate equipment used in the collection, processing, and distribution
of blood components (21 CFR 606.60); (4) failure to maintain adequate and complete standard operating procedures
for all steps in the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of blood components (21 CFR 606.100(b));
and (5) failure to report important changes in responsible personnel or manufacturing methods to FDA's Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 601.12 (a) and (b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA determined that the deviations from Federal regulations were significant and constituted a danger to public
health, warranting a suspension pursuant to 21 CFR 601.6(a). In a letter to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital dated
September 3, 1991, FDA detailed the violations noted above and suspended the firm's establishment and product licenses
for the manufacture of Source Plasma. In a letter to the firm dated May 20, 1992, FDA indicated that the firm had responded
satisfactorily to FDA's September 3, 1991, suspension letter. In the same letter, FDA permitted the firm to resume
collecting and storing Source Plasma on a limited basis for the purpose of reinspection to determine compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA conducted a followup inspection of the firm between July 27 and July 29, 1992. The inspection documented several
continuing deviations from Federal regulations. These deviations included, but were not limited to, the following:
(1) Inadequate facilities to provide for the storage of blood or blood components; (2) incomplete or incorrect disposition
records; and (3) incomplete or inadequate written procedures. FDA permitted the firm to continue to collect and store
Source Plasma on a limited basis, but FDA did not permit the firm to distribute the prepared plasma until otherwise
notified by FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA attempted to conduct a reinspection of the firm on February 2, 1993, to, in part, determine the firm's status. During
this inspection, it was observed that the donor chair had been removed and that no plasma had been collected since the
inspection ending July 29, 1992. The inspection was terminated because a meaningful inspection could not be performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter to FDA dated February 10, 1993, the firm requested voluntary revocation of its licenses and thereby waived
its opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 601.5(a). The agency granted the licensee's request by letter dated August
24, 1993, which revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license for the manufacture
of Source Plasma.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has placed copies of the letters relevant to the license revocation on file under the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. These documents include the following: FDA letters of September
3, 1991, May 20, 1992, and August 24, 1993; and the firm's letter of February 10, 1993. These documents are available
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), 21 CFR 601.5, and under authority
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director, Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.68), the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued
to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, for the manufacture
of Source Plasma were revoked, effective August 24, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of recombinant human interleukin 10 (rhIL&hyph;10) has been discovered to be a new potential means of treating
HIV infection. In vitro studies with rhIL&hyph;10 have shown it to be an inhibitor of HIV infection in human monocytes
and macrophages as well as having activity against HIV in certain T-cell and monocyte cell lines. This activity against
HIV occurs both at the time of infection and when added to previously infected cell cultures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These effects occur at IL&hyph;10 concentrations that are lower than those which inhibit other immune functions.
In addition, the use of IL&hyph;10 to interfere with HIV replication is expected to result in the amelioration of Kaposi's
sarcoma.

Novel nonpeptidic compounds designed to be inhibitors of the HIV protease enzyme have been discovered. These compounds
thus have potential as possible pharmaceutical compositions for the inhibition HIV replication and the treatment
of AIDS. Based upon SS isomers of substituted dibenzyl-5-hydroxyl-2-primidones, these compounds are expected
to not have the problems associated with current peptide-based protease inhibitors such as poor oral absorption,
poor stability, and rapid metabolism and elimination.

Novel conformationally constrained peptide polymer HIV vaccine candidates have been uncovered that generate a
strong humoral immune response not seen against monomeric peptides. Termed ``peptomers'', these candidates are
composed of specifically cross-linked synthetic peptide sequences from the highly conserved CD4 binding domains
of the gp120 regions of HIV&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HIV&hyph;2. Although peptides from these regions of gp120 do not possess any conformation in solution, the polymerized
forms were found to have conformations that resemble the theoretical conformations that might be found in these regions
of the native gp120 from HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2. Certain peptomers from HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2 bind CD4, the
cell receptor for HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2, and induce antibody responses in rabbits and rhesus monkeys that block
in vitro HIV&hyph;1 infection.

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling
94&hyph;4p. This Ruling states the Social Security Administration's longstanding policy of giving adequate written
notice of a determination of overpayment and the right to contest such determination and of providing the person from
whom we are seeking recovery with an opportunity for a face-to-face oral hearing before we deny that person's request
for waiver of recovery of the overpayment. This policy is based on the 1974 court decision in

Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To state the longstanding Social Security Administration (SSA) policy of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Giving adequate written notice of a determination of overpayment and the right to contest such determination
and request waiver of recovery of the overpayment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Providing the person from whom we are seeking recovery of an overpayment with the opportunity for a face-to-face
oral hearing before we deny a request for waiver of recovery of the overpayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy is based on the court decisions and orders discussed below.

Pertinent History: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 22, 1974, the U.S. District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Court for the Western District of Washington in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Weinberger, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash. October 22, 1974) stopped SSA from recovering overpaid Social Security benefits without
giving each member of the plaintiff class adequate written notice of the overpayment determination, the right to
contest such determination and the right to a pre-recoupment hearing. Moreover, the court stopped SSA from taking
any action to recover the overpayments before affording the class member the opportunity for a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court ordered that the written notice must include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement of the alleged overpayment, an explanation of the basis for the overpayment and SSA's proposed
action to recover the overpayment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement of the individual's right to a pre-recoupment hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructions and forms for requesting a pre-recoupment hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation that if the person did not request a pre-recoupment hearing within 30 days of the date of mailing
of the overpayment notice, it would be presumed that the person waived his/her right to the hearing and recovery of
the alleged overpayment would begin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement of any other administrative relief available (i.e., reconsideration of the fact and/or amount
of overpayment and waiver of recovery of the overpayment); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement that the local SSA office would help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court also ordered the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. SSA had to restore all benefits withheld from the named plaintiffs pending an opportunity for a pre-recoupment
hearing. The person had to be given the opportunity to examine his/her claims file at least 5 days prior to the date of
the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The pre-recoupment hearing had to be conducted by an SSA employee who had no prior knowledge of the events leading
to the overpayment determination and the decision to recover the overpayment. At the hearing the person requesting
waiver had to be given the opportunity to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Personally appear, testify, and cross-examine any witnesses;

&bull;Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submit documents for consideration at the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The court, however, did not require that a transcript be made of the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. After the hearing, SSA had to issue a written decision to the individual (and his/her representative, if any) specifying
the findings of fact and conclusions in support of the decision to approve or deny waiver and advising of the individual's
right to appeal the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the court order, SSA began to issue overpayment notices containing all of the aforementioned information
and to offer pre-recoupment hearings to all class members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 20, 1979, the Supreme Court held in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Califano v. Yamasaki, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
442 U.S. 682 (1979), that individuals who filed a written request for waiver were entitled to the opportunity for a
pre-recoupment oral hearing, but those who requested only reconsideration were not so entitled. Thereafter, SSA
applied its revised overpayment notice and pre-recoupment hearing procedures to all individuals who are determined
to be overpaid under the title II or Black Lung programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 31, 1981, the court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) required SSA to automatically schedule pre-recoupment hearings for persons whose
request for waiver of overpayment recovery could not be approved after initial paper review. On February 10, 1983,
the court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved procedures developed by SSA in response to the 1981 decree whereby pre-recoupment
hearings would be automatically scheduled provided that the scheduling would be in writing. The scheduling letter
had to contain all the necessary information about the date, time, and place of the hearing; the procedure for reviewing
the file prior to the hearing; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled date, time, or place; and all other
information necessary to fully inform the claimant about the pre-recoupment hearing. SSA began to automatically
schedule pre-recoupment hearings in writing in April 1983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its order of October 19, 1987, the court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buffington, et al. v. Bowen, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 734&hyph;73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved SSA's plan to transfer waiver decisionmaking authority from the processing
centers to the field offices for Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments. SSA implemented this change in
July 1988.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overpayment Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the court decisions, when an overpayment is discovered, the person is immediately notified. The
notice includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The overpayment amount and how and when it occurred; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A request for full, immediate refund, unless the overpayment can be withheld from the next month's benefit;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The proposed adjustment of benefits if refund is not received within 30 days after the date of the notice and
adjustment of benefits is available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation of the availability of a different rate of withholding when full withholding is proposed, installment
payments when refund is requested and adjustment is not currently available, and/or cross-program recovery when
refund is requested and the person is receiving another type of benefit from SSA (cross-program recovery is not available
to residents of New York and Pennsylvania); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation of the right to request waiver of recovery and the automatic scheduling of a folder review and
pre-recoupment hearing (commonly referred to as a personal conference) if a request for waiver cannot be approved
after initial paper review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Instructions about the availability of forms for requesting reconsideration and waiver; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation that if the person does not request waiver or reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the
overpayment notice, recovery of the overpayment will begin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation of the right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A statement that the local SSA office will help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An explanation that the person receiving the notice should notify SSA promptly if reconsideration, waiver,
a lesser rate of withholding, repayment by installments, or cross-program adjustment is wanted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Form SSA&hyph;3105 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Form SSA&hyph;3105 (Important Information About Your Appeal and Waiver Rights) is included with each overpayment
notice. The SSA&hyph;3105 further explains the pre-recoupment review process and contains a tear-off form which
the person may complete and return to SSA if he/she wants reconsideration and/or waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Delaying Recovery of the Overpayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure meaningful opportunity to contest the correctness of an overpayment determination and/or establish entitlement
to waiver, the date on which full refund is due and, if appropriate, the date on which adjustment will begin must be at
least 30 days after the date of the overpayment notice. If the individual responds within 30 days after the date of the
overpayment notice, SSA must take action to ensure that benefit payments are not interrupted. If the 30-day period
cannot be assured, SSA must postpone any proposed recoupment for a longer period. Anytime waiver is requested, SSA
stops recovery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Requesting Waiver
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When waiver is requested, the individual gives SSA information (usually on Form SSA&hyph;632&hyph;BK (Request
for Waiver of Overpayment Recovery or Change in Repayment Rate)) to support his/her contention that he/she is without
fault in causing the overpayment and that recovery would either cause financial hardship or be inequitable. That
information, along with supporting documentation, is reviewed to determine if waiver can be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Reviewing Waiver Request
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments, the waiver request is reviewed in the field office; in Disability
Insurance overpayments, it is reviewed in the processing center. If waiver cannot be approved after review of the
claims folder, the person is notified in writing and given necessary information about the dates, times, and place
of the folder review and personal conference; the procedure for reviewing the claims folder prior to the personal
conference; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled dates, times, or place; and all other information
necessary to fully inform the person about the personal conference. The folder review is always scheduled at least
5 days before the personal conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Folder Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the folder review, the person and/or the person's representative has the right to review the claims folder and applicable
law and regulations with the decisionmaker or another SSA representative who is prepared to answer questions. The
individual can get copies of any requested material from the claims folder or pertinent sections of the law or regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal Conference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the personal conference, the person is given the opportunity to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Personally appear, testify, cross-examine any witnesses, and make arguments;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submit documents for consideration by the decisionmaker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decisionmaker:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tells the person that the decisionmaker was not previously involved in the issue under review, that the waiver
decision is solely the decisionmaker's, and that the waiver decision is based only on the evidence or information
presented or reviewed at the conference;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertains the role and identity of everyone present;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indicates whether or not the person reviewed the claims file;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explains the provisions of law and regulations applicable to the issue;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Briefly summarizes the evidence already in file which will be considered;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertains from the person whether the information presented is correct and whether he/she fully understands
it;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allows the person and the person's representative, if any, to present the person's case;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Secures updated financial information, if necessary;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allows each witness to present information and allows the person and the person's representative, if any,
to question the witness;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ascertains whether there is any further evidence to be presented;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reminds the person of any evidence promised by the person which has not been presented;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lets the person and the person's representative, if any, present any final summary or closing statement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explains that a decision will be made and the person will be notified in writing; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Explains further appeal rights in the event the decision is adverse to the person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal Conference Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA issues a written decision to the individual (and his/her representative, if any) specifying the findings of fact
and conclusions in support of the decision to approve or deny waiver and advising of the individual's right to appeal
the decision.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The City of Cedar Park (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit
pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number
PRT&hyph;788842. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroica chrysoparia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction and operation of a water pipeline, in Travis County,
Texas. The proposed development will eliminate about 4.2 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will not be made
before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the
Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are at 50 CFR 17.22.

The Applicant plans to construct a 20,193-foot long water supply pipeline from Lake Travis eastward to the Williamson
County line. An Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan has been prepared for the project. As mitigation
for the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler, the Applicant proposes to preserve documented perch trees
for the warbler along the route; limit clearing to 35 feet wide along the route and two 100 feet by 100 feet staging areas
in non-habitat; schedule work during the season when the warblers are absent from the area (August 1 through March
1); and the purchase and dedication of 33 acres of occupied warbler habitat to a conservation organization approved
by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three because they were not economically viable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 106 of the amended Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Secretary of Labor is required to set performance
standards for programs serving: (1) adults and youth under Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C; (2) dislocated workers
under Title III; and (3) older workers under section 204(d). The Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 (Amendments)
also introduced significant changes in the way job training programs are designed and operated at the local levels.
These statutory changes, combined with recent legislative and administrative initiatives to promote high-quality,
results-driven, customer-oriented services throughout the Federal Government, are not only reshaping the way
JTPA delivers its services, but also how to measure its effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
National job training objectives have remained unchanged since 1990 and focus on enhancing the long-term employability
and economic self-sufficiency of those most at risk of becoming or remaining unemployed. Current measures of the
program's progress in achieving these objectives relate directly to near-term employment and earnings levels of
adult program completers and levels of employment and skill enhancements of youth program completers. These outcomes
do not, by themselves, measure the quality of the services received or the extent to which the program is able to improve
upon participants' prior employment, earnings and welfare dependency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, the Department will be undertaking a comprehensive review of its performance standards over the
next year to examine alternative program measures and more cost efficient ways of assessing the program's long-term
effects on its graduates. Ongoing surveys of JTPA's customers will also provide invaluable feedback on how helpful
JTPA services are to its users, what other services are needed but not provided by the program, and the extent to which
good outcomes are related to levels of customer satisfaction. Finally, the Employment and Training Administration
will initiate a nationwide JTPA Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human
resource investments in terms of obtaining high-quality employment for those participants most at-risk of failure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outcome measures for Title II&hyph;A and C will be retained until this performance standards review is completed.
Numerical levels for these core standards have been updated to reflect the most recent JTPA program experience.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its Title III programs; therefore, changes in outcome
measures will be deferred until the results of this critical assessment are available. Governors will continue to
be required to set an entered employment rate standard for their Title III programs and are encouraged to establish
an average wage at placement goal. At the same time, the Department will be exploring ways to use performance standards
to improve the quality of services provided to dislocated workers, and to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 204(d) of JTPA, older worker programs are now subject to performance standards. However, no incentive
awards or sanctions are associated with these standards. Outcomes for these programs focus on increasing employment
and earnings similar to those programs serving other disadvantaged adults. Because field evidence suggests that
older workers are much more likely to remain employed once they are placed in jobs, employment and wages will be measured
at program completion rather than at a later follow-up period. Together, these measures underscore the employment
focus of the program, particularly in jobs that are higher paying.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with the legislative provisions, the Department considered adding specific outcome measures for hard-to-serve
participants and separate outcomes for in-school and out-of-school youth. In the interest of avoiding a proliferation
of performance measures and limiting local flexibility in programming, additional measures for these three separate
groups were not established. Rather, the requirement to promote services to hard-to-serve individuals will be addressed
from an incentive policy perspective and the issue of in-school and out-of-school standards will continue to be addressed
through the performance standards adjustment process. When judging service delivery area (SDA) performance and
awarding incentive funds, States will need to design incentive policies that will promote more effective services
to out-of-school youth and reward placements into jobs with employer-assisted benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The policy of excluding cost measures from incentive awards will remain unchanged; however, States are reminded
of the integral role of financial oversight in program management. States are also encouraged to utilize available
administrative data to relate overall costs of job training to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings
and reductions in welfare. The Office of the Inspector General will be collaborating with ETA in developing a mechanism
for measuring the program's return on its investments. The wider JTPA community will also be invited to participate
in this effort.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 1, 1994, proposed revisions to the performance standards for JTPA Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Title
III, and newly instituted section 204(d) performance standards were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 9910. Interested parties were invited to submit written comments through March 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor (DOL) received 96 written comments on the proposed performance standards issuance. Eighteen
of the letters explicitly endorsed the overall direction which the Department is taking in establishing performance
standards policy for Program Years 1994 and 1995. In general, the majority of comments requested clarifications
or raised issues about specific aspects of the proposed requirements. While the concept of imposing a hard-to-serve
``gate'' for incentive awards eligibility received support, its application to terminees rather than enrollments
drew considerable local and State criticism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following summarizes the major issues raised by the commenters and the Department's respective responses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Participants Rather Than Terminees as the Basis for Determining SDA Eligibility for Incentive Awards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department specifically sought comments on whether the hard-to-serve ``gate'' for incentive award eligibility
fully addresses the need to emphasize this population in the performance standards system, and whether compliance
with the gate should be measured against those enrolled in training or those completing the program. A majority of
those commenting on this issue agreed with the Department's approach of restricting eligibility for incentive awards
to those programs that enroll in training at least a minimum (65%) hard-to-serve adults as well as youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, fully three-fourths of States and SDAs submitting comments specifically recommended that the basis for
the gate should be participants (all individuals served during the year, including those still enrolled at the end
of the program year) rather than terminees. Basing the 65% hard-to-serve level on program terminees was seen as pressuring
SDAs to ``manipulate'' their terminations. Local programs can manage the recruitment process to ensure that adequate
numbers of hard-to-serve are enrolled. Ensuring comparable numbers of hard-to-serve individuals will graduate
each year is more problematic because of the clients' varying training needs. Participants with multiple barriers
typically need to remain in programs longer than those with fewer barriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concurs with the arguments made for changing the basis of the incentive award ``gate'' from terminations
to participants. Particularly compelling is the rationale that hard-to-serve participants need longer-term interventions
and the adverse effects that such a gate might create in prompting SDAs to terminate participants prematurely. Thus,
beginning in FY 1994 for SDAs to become eligible for incentives, at least 65 percent of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the SDAs' Title II&hyph;A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title II&hyph;C (in-school and out-of-school combined) participants receiving training, and/or other services
beyond objective assessment, must be hard-to-serve. For the purpose of determining compliance with this requirement,
those individuals with SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor are to be included as well as participants
in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in five percent-funded projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further reinforce JTPA's focus on serving hard-to-serve participants, the Department encourages Governors
to design incentive policies that explicitly promote increased service to that group. For example, Governors may
wish to adjust themselves based on the degree to which SDAs exceed the incentive eligibility ``gate'' or on a sliding
scale of continuous improvement.

Improved Service to Out-of-School Youth and Employer-Assisted Benefits Incentive Award Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
About 30 percent of all commenters mentioned this issue. Most of the comments requested additional guidance and clarification
on how these two items could be incorporated into incentive award policies and asked whether Governors could ignore
or ``zero weight'' either one of them in the awarding of incentives. The Department is sensitive to concerns about
establishing incentive criteria without sufficient information on the program's prior experience in placing individuals
in jobs with employer-assisted benefits; or in the case of out-of-school youth, in the absence of effective program
models that have a positive impact on a youth's long-term earnings potential.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the field comments several changes have been made to the incentive policy guidance as originally proposed.
First, Governors will be encouraged, but not required, to include these criteria in State incentive policy for PY
1994. States will be required to incorporate these criteria (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) beginning in PY
1995. In the interim States can use data from the Standardized Program Information Reports (SPIR) for PYs 1992 and
1993 to establish performance benchmarks for programs serving out-of-school youth and job placements providing
employer-assisted benefits. Therefore, the Department is giving Governors maximum flexibility in terms of how
these criteria may be applied. Suggested approaches for rewarding improved service to out-of-school youth and placements
in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits will be included in the Training and Employment Guidance Letter appended
to this Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that the intent of the incentive provisions is to encourage service to more out-of-school
youth; thus, SDAs should be rewarded solely on the extent to which they exceed the statutory minimum service levels.
The Department's position is that rewarding SDAs simply on the basis of increasing the numbers of out-of-school youth
does not go far enough in addressing the disappointing findings from the National JTPA study. Thus, while SDAs will
not be exempted from the statutory requirement to serve at least 50% out-of-school youth, ETA is encouraging States
to use incentive funds to pilot innovative youth models and to evaluate and replicate promising strategies.

20-Hour Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(k) of JTPA requires for performance standards purposes that employment be for at least 20 or more hours
per week. This requirement applies to Title II&hyph;A (adults), Title II&hyph;C (youth), Section 204(d) (older
workers), and Title III (dislocated workers) programs. About 15 percent of the comments questioned the reasonableness
of this requirement for in-school youth, older workers, or disabled participants, and requested that the Department
waive it in these cases. Since this requirement is explicitly defined 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in the statute, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it cannot be waived.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters also requested clarification about the reference period, i.e., whether a ``week'' means 5 or
7 days and whether follow-up is needed to verify that an individual actually worked for at least 20 hours. For determining
compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood
as a condition of employment. (See section 5 of the attached TEGL.) No formal verification is required, but the Department
encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking to assess compliance by SDAs.

Definition of ``Failure to Meet Standards''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(j)(i)(A) of JTPA requires the Secretary to establish uniform criteria of determining whether a service
delivery area fails to meet performance standards. To comply with this provision, the Department specified the number
of failed standards which constitute overall failure. Commenters generally agreed with the concept of a uniform
definition of performance failure; however, there was minor opposition to defining overall failure as missing a
combination of any three standards or simply missing both youth standards. The Department was criticized for placing
too much weight on the youth standards. Given Congressional interest in improving the quality of service to youth,
as reflected in various provisions in the amended JTPA, and given the need to respond to the programmatic issues raised
by the National JTPA Study, the Department believes its emphasis on youth program performance is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested clarification on whether SDAs had to fail the same standards two consecutive years
to trigger a reorganization. The sanction policy does not apply to the same standards over the two-year period. Thus,
for the purpose of identifying whether an SDA has failed to meet performance standards for two consecutive years,
overall failure means failing any three core standards or both youth standards for two consecutive years. Definitions

Performance Standards for Older Worker Programs Under Section 204(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other major area of comment involved the performance standards for older worker programs under Section 204(d).
A total of 27 letters was received from advocates/service providers and State agencies on aging. These letters questioned
the methodology and data used for setting the performance standards levels. Many indicated that the proposed levels
were too high, particularly the level of the average wage at placement standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since March 1, 1994, when the notice appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, additional data became available from the PY 1992 SPIR. Reported information on the Section 204(d) Older Worker
program was analyzed and used to establish revised levels for the standards that are more closely related to actual
experience for that program. This has resulted in a lower entered employment rate standard, but the average wage at
placement standard remains unchanged. It should be remembered, however, that the Secretary's standards are merely

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
departure points
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which will be adjusted to account for local economic conditions and the characteristics of the terminees. The Department
will be providing States with a methodology for making these adjustments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Performance Standards Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 9 comments was received about the overall performance levels for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C standards.
Comments were mixed with hard-to-serve advocates supporting both higher and lower levels. The majority of comments
advocating lower levels were from youth advocates who felt that the standard for youth employment was too high given
the recent decline in the rate of placing youth in jobs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The numerical values of the standards are generally set so that if local programs continue to perform unchanged from
the prior program year, 75 percent of the system are expected to exceed their standards. The proposed numerical standards
for five of the six core measures (all but the YEER) and the Title III Entered Employment Rate measure are set in this
manner, using PY 1992 performance. Further adjustments were made to reflect the new 20 hour per week minimum requirement
for employment. To arbitrarily raise the level of all standards, as suggested by certain advocate groups, appeared
counterproductive when the Department was imposing new targeting requirements and employment caveats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One exception is the numerical standard for the YEER which if similarly set, would lead to reduced standards for SDAs.
The recently published 30-month results from the National JTPA Study suggest that employment and earnings experienced
by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to foster improved services to out-of-school
youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary's standards for the new older worker performance measures were derived from an analysis of available
PY 1992 Section 204(d) data from the SPIR. The same general rules that were used for setting the levels for the Titles
II&hyph;A, II&hyph;C, and III programs, including the adjustment for 20-hour employment, were used for the Section
204(d) program. Again, it must be emphasized that these national standards are merely departure points and States
must make adjustments to account for local conditions.

This issuance is procedural in character and gives directions to States and local service deliverers on the implementation
of performance standards under Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Section 204(d), and Title III of JTPA. Therefore,
it is not classified as ``major'' under Executive Order 12291 and no impact analysis is required. This issuance has
been assessed according to the Federalist policymaking criteria outlined in Executive Order 12612. The Department
believes that this issuance will not materially limit the policymaking discretion of the States. This issuance both
addresses Departmental policy objectives and permits States discretionary authority in the application of performance
standards. The procedural framework included in this issuance enables States to better assist localities in more
effective and efficient program design and management.

Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To transmit guidance on the Secretary's required performance measures and the Secretary's implementing instructions
for performance standards for Program Years (PY's) 1994 and 1995 (July 1, 1994&hyph;June 30, 1995; July 1, 1995&hyph;June
30, 1996). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sec. 106 of JTPA, as amended, directs the Secretary to establish performance standards for adult, youth, and dislocated
worker programs. These standards may be updated every two years based on the most recent JTPA program experience,
as well as program emphases and goals established by the Department of Labor. The Secretary also issues instructions
for implementing standards and parameter criteria for States to follow in adjusting the Secretary's standards for
service delivery areas (SDAs) and substate areas (SSAs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Job Training Reform Amendments (JTRA) of 1992 mandated significant changes in the design and operation of local
job training programs, as well as the criteria used to assess their performance. Revised Section 106 requires that
performance standards for Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Section 204(d) and Title III programs measure the number
of job placements that provide a minimum of 20 hours of work per week, and that programs be rewarded based on high performance,
increased service to the ``hard-to-serve,'' and quality job placements that are both high-paying and offer employer-assisted
benefits. Incentive and sanction policies are to be structured around more explicit criteria, and performance standards
failure is now federally defined to ensure greater uniformity in assessing underperformance nationwide. As a result
of the JTPA amendments, section 204(d) now mandates performance measures for the older worker program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in responding to the substantive changes required in the section 106 amendments, a Technical
Workgroup was convened in Washington, DC, in mid-July 1993. The workgroup had representatives from State and local
JTPA programs; public interest groups, including the Partnership for Training and Employment Careers; the U.S.
Conference of Mayors; the National Association of Counties; the National Governors' Association; and the National
Council on the Aging; and staff from the Department of Labor (DOL) Office of the Inspector General. This Guidance Letter
incorporates, to a large extent, the workgroup's findings.

Performance Management Goals for PY's 1994&hyph;1995.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Departmental goals, initially established for PY 1990 in anticipation of the amendments, remain unchanged and are
as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Targeting services to a more at-risk population;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Improving the quality and intensity of services that lead to skills acquisition, long-term employability and increased
earnings;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Placing greater emphasis on basic skills acquisition to qualify for employment or advanced education or training;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Promoting comprehensive, coordinated human resource programs to address the multiple needs of at-risk populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, with the passage of the 1992 JTPA Amendments, the performance management system has been tasked, through
its performance incentive policies, to improve service to out-of-school youth and also to foster employment in better
quality jobs which offer high wages and employer-assisted benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These goals are reflected in the Secretary's six Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C (core) measures, national numerical
standards for these measures, new incentive award criteria, and associated reporting requirements. Governors
still retain authority to establish additional standards which reflect State policy and to develop the specific
approach to determining incentive awards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issuance specifies the national standards for PY's 1994&hyph;1995 and introduces the new criteria which must
be a part of State incentive grant policies. Data to support additional non-cost measures will continue to be reported
and Governors may use these measures, or others in making State incentive award determinations. Data on costs together
with program performance will provide critical information for State monitoring, fiscal oversight, and assist
States in measuring returns on their human resource investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has identified two additional goals for PY 1994&hyph;1995. These are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Establishing a strong customer focus and orientation toward improving the program's responsiveness in meeting
the individual needs of participants; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Seeking and using customer feedback to monitor the appropriateness of JTPA services and to promote continuous program
improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States and SDAs are encouraged to survey customers on a regular basis as an integral part of their program oversight
to identify program weaknesses and to improve program services. Technical assistance will be made available on cost-effective
ways to gather and utilize such information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Explanation of Performance Standards Levels
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C numerical standards were derived from PY 1992 aggregate performance data reported
on the JTPA Annual Status Report (JASR) and are generally set at a minimally-acceptable level that approximately
75% of the SDA's can be expected to exceed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the numerical standard for the Youth Entered Employment Rate (YEER) in the same way would lead to reduced
standards for SDAs. However, recent National JTPA Study results suggest that employment and earnings experienced
by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to encourage improved services to out-of-school
youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earnings standards have been adjusted to account for expected future inflation. Finally, an additional special
adjustment has been made to employment-related standards to account for the requirement in section 106(k) that permits
credit, for performance standards purposes, only for employment that is scheduled for 20 or more hours per week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to the Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C standards, the Title III standard was derived from PY 1992 performance
data reported on the Worker Adjustment Program Annual Program Report (WAPR). This standard is set at a level that,
approximately, 75 percent of the substate areas can be expected to exceed. As with the employment measures for Titles
II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since discrete aggregate data were not available for PY 1992 Section 204(d) Older Worker program performance, available
SPIR data were used to assist in setting performance standards levels for that program. As with the employment measures
for Titles II&hyph;A, II&hyph;C, and III, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment
requirement.

Programs operated under section 204(d) are State programs even though they may be managed by various local entities.
Therefore, performance standards will be applied to the total older worker programs State-wide. Unlike the adult
and youth programs under Title II&hyph;A/C, however, no incentive awards or sanctions are associated with these
standards.

for each of the six Secretary's measures; for the Older Worker program, Governors are required to set numerical Entered
Employment Rate and Average Wage at Placement standards for programs operated under section 204(d); for Title III,
Governors are required to set for each substate area a numerical performance standard for the Entered Employment
Rate and are encouraged to establish an Average Wage at Placement goal

The Department offers Governors an adjustment methodology that conforms both to these parameters and to the requirement
in section 106(d). This methodology covers Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C Section 204(d), and Title III programs
and will be provided to States in a soon-to-be issued Training and Employment Information Notice. Should the Governor
choose to use an alternate methodology, or make adjustments not addressed by the Departmental model, it must conform
to the parameter criteria and be documented in the Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plan (GCSSP) prior
to the program year to which it applies. The State Job Training Coordinating Council and, where appropriate, the State
Human Resources Investment Council must have an opportunity to consider adjustments to the Secretary's standards
and to recommend variations. To determine whether an SDA has met or exceeded a performance standard, Governors must
use actual end-of-year program data to recalculate the performance standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Performance Standards Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Governors must calculate the performance of their SDA's, SSA's, and section 204(d) programs according to the definitions
included in the Attachments.

Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C Incentive and Sanction Policies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Performance standards are to be established for programs funded under Titles II and III of the Act. In applying the
Secretary's standards for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the six core measures and also consider criteria relating to programs successfully serving out-of-school youth
and placement in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Governors are encouraged to begin using these criteria
in PY 1994 incentive policies; these criteria are required (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) to be incorporated
into State incentive policies beginning in PY 1995. Governors may select additional non-cost measures, such as increased
service to hard-to-serve participants, to form the basis of incentive policies as long as the following criteria
are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As the basis for making incentive awards, the Governors must use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i.e., cannot ``zero weight'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of the six Secretary's core measures. Beginning in PY 1995, Governors will also be required to reward innovative
out-of-school youth program models either identified by the Department of Labor or recognized by the State as having
a demonstrated record of success, and placements in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Although successful
programs for out-of-school youth remain the cornerstone of out-of-school incentives, SDA's will still be expected
to exceed the 50 percent minimum service level to be rewarded under that criterion. Governors have considerable flexibility
in implementing the new incentive criteria. Suggested approaches to addressing these criteria are included as Attachments
3 and 4 to this TEGL. Decisions regarding the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
relative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 weight or emphasis of each core measure (e.g., the Youth Entered Employment Rate) and incentive criterion (e.g.,
placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits) in a State's incentive award formula rest with the Governor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The core measures will be the basis for identifying SDA's that are candidates for technical assistance and for imposing
sanctions. At least 75 percent of the funds set aside for performance incentives must be related to these measures
and the out-of-school youth and employer-assisted benefits criteria, in accordance with section 106(b)(7)(E).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cost standards cannot be used for incentive award purposes. However, States are reminded of the integral role of
financial reviews in program management. States are encouraged to explore ways of relating overall costs of job training
to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Incentive policies may include adjustments to incentive award amounts based upon factors such as grant size, additional
services to the hard-to-serve, intensity of service, and expenditure level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A Secretary's standard for service to the hard-to-serve, as required by section 106(b)(7)(B) of JTPA, has been
established in the form of a stand-alone eligibility criterion (``gate'') for incentive awards. In order for an SDA
to be eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 incentive award, at least 65 percent of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the SDA's (a) Title II&hyph;A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (b) Title II&hyph;C (in-school and out-of-school youth combined) participants receiving training and/or other
service beyond objective assessment must be hard-to-serve. The definitions of hard-to-serve are to be consistent
with the definitions in sections 203(b), 263(b), and 263(d) of the Act. For the purpose of determining compliance
with this requirement, Governors are to include any SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor,
as well as the characteristics of participants in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in
five percent-funded projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. For those SDA's that successfully ``pass through'' the gate, three criteria (in addition to any funds set aside
for Governors' standards) will determine the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
amount
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the incentive award: (1) exceeding the Secretary's performance standards, (2) providing quality service to out-of-school
youth, and (3) placing participants in employment that provides employer-assisted benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The definition of ``employer-assisted benefits'' is to be consistent with the SPIR definition (see Attachment
4). For the purposes of reporting and performance standards, fringe benefits count so long as they are an acknowledged
component of employment conditions, whether actually received at the time of placement or not. Thus, State incentive
policies will be structured to include benefit information for those participants who entered employment at termination,
and Governors will have considerable latitude in implementing this incentive policy requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Consistent with present DOL policy, SDA's that pass through the ``gate'' and exceed all six of the Secretary's Titles
II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
receive an incentive award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Determination of an SDA's failure to meet these standards and the consequent imposition of technical assistance
and reorganization requirements under section 106(j) will be based only on the Secretary's Title II&hyph;A and Title
II&hyph;C core measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_``Meeting Performance Standards'' overall is defined as meeting at least four of the six core standards, one of which
must be a youth standard. Conversely, overall ``Failure'' is defined as failing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
three (3) or more of the core standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
failing both youth standards. Definitions for meeting and failing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individual 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
standards will be established by Governors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Failure for the first year precludes an SDA from receiving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
incentive awards and requires Governors to provide technical assistance to the underperforming SDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Failure in the second consecutive year precludes an SDA from receiving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
incentive award and requires Governors to impose a reorganization plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 106(j)(3) requires each State to report to the Secretary, not later than 90 days after the end of each program
year, the actual performance and performance standards for each SDA within that State. Within the same timeframe,
technical assistance plans developed by the State are required for each SDA ``failing'' for the first year. A 90-day
timeframe also applies to the imposition of a reorganization plan, which is mandatory when an SDA ``fails'' for a second
consecutive year. Specific procedures for the formal performance standards report and required State action will
be provided under separate cover. However, in addition to the formal annual process, there should be ongoing oversight
of SDA performance and continuous technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at addressing areas where program
performance can be improved. In addition, the Employment and Training Administration will initiate a national JTPA
Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human resource investments in terms
of high-quality employment (type of job, wages and fringe benefits) for those participants most at-risk of failure.
Further information on the content and procedures for preparing the ``report card'' will be provided separately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Governors must specify in the GCSSP their incentive award policy under section 202(c)(1)(B) and 202(c)(3)(A)
and imposition of sanctions policy under section 106(j). It is recognized that the timing of this issuance may preclude
some States from submitting complete incentive policies with their PY 1994&hyph;95 GCSSPs. States are to provide
as much information as possible in compliance with required due dates and submit a GCSSP amendment containing complete
information no later than August 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In PY 1994 and 1995, Governors will continue to have the authority to exclude pilot projects serving ``hard-to-serve''
individuals funded from the 5 percent incentive fund set-aside in computing their standards and actual performance.
States and SDA's are encouraged to use such funds to develop or replicate model programs serving out-of-school youth,
particularly those based on contextual learning models.

Those terminees who receive only objective assessment and/or supportive services (or only objective assessment
and/or supportive services and entered employment) are to be excluded from the calculation of performance outcomes
for Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, and section 204(d) older worker programs. Participants in special 5-percent-funded
projects may, at the discretion of the Governor, also be excluded from the calculation of performance outcomes for
Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C.

The Title II&hyph;A adult and welfare follow-up employment measures will continue to be based on individuals who
terminate during the first three quarters of the program year and the last quarter of the previous program year. If
the response rates for those employed at termination and those not employed at termination in an SDA differ by more
than 5 percentage points in either the adult or welfare samples, then the calculations of the follow-up outcomes for
that group must be modified to adjust for non-response bias. The following defines the Title II&hyph;C performance
standards:

employment for 20 or more hours per week. For determining compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period
of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood as a condition of the employment. No formal verification
is required, but the Department encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking
to assess compliance by SDA's.

average) and a quantitative element (e.g., a time limit for completion of the program or course of study). This policy
may provide for exceptional situations in which students who do not meet the standard of progress are nonetheless
making satisfactory progress during a probationary period because of mitigating circumstances.

Attachment 3_Rewarding Model Programs for Out-of-School Youth
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the Department of Labor's high priorities is to improve the effectiveness of JTPA programs for out-of-school
youth. Results from the National JTPA Study show that outcomes achieved by out-of-school youth 30 months after entering
the program are disappointing. To implement section 107(b)(7)(C) of the amended JTPA, the Department encourages
in PY 1994, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
will require
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in PY 1995, that Governors reward out-of-school youth programs that are identified by the Department or recognized
by the State as having a demonstrated record of success. States need to develop ways to identify such programs. Possible
approaches include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Using outcomes achieved to identify successful programs. Outcomes could include both the two youth performance
measures and measures such as learning gains and earnings/retention in full-time employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternatively, States could offer SDA's ``seed money'' from incentive funds to plan/operate programs that provide
innovative or high-quality training to out-of-school youth based on criteria established by the Governor. Examples
of such criteria include training that integrates occupational and basic skills training, and training that emphasizes
acquiring job skills in demand in the emerging workplace.

Note:

 Whatever method is used to reward successful out-of-school youth programs, access to such incentives must be limited
to those SDA's that serve in excess of 50 percent out-of-school youth in their overall Title II&hyph;C program.

Attachment 4_Rewarding Placements in Jobs Providing Employer-Assisted Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PY 1994 is the first year Governors are asked to reward SDA's for placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits,
including health benefits. (Governors will be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to do so beginning in PY 1995.) Rewarding such placements is intended to increase the focus on overall job quality.
To include placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits in their incentive policies, States will need to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Specify how the criterion will be measured. The definition must be consistent with that for SPIR Item 35c (i.e.,
consisting of, at a minimum, health insurance benefits and coverage under Social Security or an equivalent pension
plan). Note that it is not necessary for an individual to actually receive benefits when employment begins as long
as they are an acknowledged component of employment conditions. For example, health benefits available after a waiting-period
and benefits that are refused because of availability from another source both count as employer-assisted benefits.
Examples of measures of jobs with benefits, using data from SPIR Item 35c are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_among terminees who enter employment, the percent who are in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_among 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 terminees, the percent who enter employment and are in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Determine how to reward placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits. One possible approach would require
the State to determine a departure point or benchmark to use in setting rewards levels for benefits. This departure
point would serve the same function served by the numerical national standards for the Secretary's core measures.
It would be the level that, before any adjustment for local factors, identifies rewardable performance. Under this
approach, a State would also decide whether and how the departure point should be adjusted for local clientele and
economic conditions when setting reward levels for each SDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than setting reward levels for employer-assisted benefits using a process akin to setting standards for the
Secretary's core measures, States may choose a simpler approach. Because there are no sanctions based on this criterion,
it is not absolutely necessary to set a minimally acceptable performance level. It is possible to reward SDA's at all
levels of performance on employer-assisted benefits. One way to do this would be to set aside a portion of incentive
funds to reward such placements. This reward pool could be divided among SDA's based on their proportionate share
of all placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits. This procedure is equivalent to giving a fixed amount
for each placement (i.e., the amount is the value of the pool divided by the total number of placements into jobs with
benefits in the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this approach may be viewed as favoring SDA's in areas where benefits are widely prevalent, it should be viewed
as interim until better data on employer-assisted benefits are available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the spirit of the National Performance Review, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information
Service (NTIS) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will team up to demonstrate how government
can operate more effectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Audiovisual Center at NARA will be transferred to NTIS under an agreement which will consolidate much
of the Federal government's capability for audio, visual, and multimedia materials production and dissemination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a time when NARA has developed a strategic vision of its future calling for a sharpening of its focus on the archival
aspects of its programs, the need for service support for audiovisual and multimedia across government is rapidly
increasing. Merging the complimentary strengths of the NARA National Audiovisual Center with the existing NTIS
which has been congressionally mandated to collect and disseminate scientific and technical information will result
in better services to agencies and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new National Audiovisual Center at NTIS will be ideally positioned to serve as a hub for access to Federally developed
media and training materials. By combining resources with the NARA center, NTIS will now be able to provide Federal
training technology transfer services to both the public and private sectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transfer of the National Audiovisual Center from NARA to NTIS will be effective October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Commonwealth Edison Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;72 issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo, the licensee) for operation of the Braidwood
Station, Unit 1, located in Will County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Braidwood, Unit 1, Technical Specifications (TSs) to remove the condition
limiting operation of the facility to 100 days during the present fuel cycle when T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is greater than 500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and to restore the reactor coolant dose equivalent Iodine-131 limit to 1 microcurie per gram of coolant from
the present value of 0.35. Both the limit on permissible operational time and the reduction in the permissible level
of Iodine-131 were incorporated into the TSs by Amendment No. 50 issued to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;72
for Braidwood Station, Unit 1, on May 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Braidwood Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 imposed a 100 calendar days with T

&cir;F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of main steam line break (MSLB) leakage
predicted in Braidwood Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic
method of draft NUREG 1477, ``Voltage Based Interim Plugging for Steam Generator Tubes_Task Group Report,'' with
the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 microcurie per gram (&mu;Ci/gm) to
0.35 &mu;Ci/gm. However, WCAP 14046; ``Braidwood Unit 1 Technical Support for Cycle 5 Steam Generator Interim Plugging
Criteria'' (WCAP&hyph;14046), docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal,
has shown using the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Leakrate Correlation that projected End Of Cycle (EOC)&hyph;5
MSLB leakage is 3.1 gallons per minute (gpm) which is less than the allowable limit of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This
analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP&hyph;14046.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus the Unit 1 100-day operating limit and reactor coolant dose equivalent iodine restriction imposed by Amendment
50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 100-day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report
(SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit
derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle
operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging
criteria applied at Braidwood 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights
from the draft Braidwood Individual Plant Examination (IPE). Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June
30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final form, it is believed that the quantification in hand is sufficiently robust
to allow a validation assessment of the impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in
the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit 2 dated August 19, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values calculated in WCAP&hyph;14046, for Beginning of Cycle (BOC) 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 Probability Of Detection
(POD) were used to develop a cycle average burst probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6
for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD
on core damage frequency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E&hyph;5 per reactor year with a total contribution
from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E&hyph;8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate
repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution
by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the
calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance
of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability
during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The
EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications.
The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one
volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD
of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To further address SG tube burst probability, the following qualitative discussion of limited tube support plate
(TSP) displacement is provided. As part of ComEd's technical support for the implementation of IPC at Braidwood Unit
1, numerous quantitative analyses were completed to assure the structural integrity of the SG tubing. These quantitative
determinations were provided as part of WCAP&hyph;14046. These analyses focused on the quantifiable elements of
the IPC to evaluate the impact of crack length on steam generator tube leakage and burst, and were completed consistent
with the guidance provided in draft RG 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded SG Tubes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bases for these calculations are the analyses completed by the utility industry and reported to the NRC in the EPRI
Draft Report TR&hyph;100407, ``PWR Steam Generator Tube Repair Limits_Technical Support Document for Outside
Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at Tube Support Plates'', Revision 1, August 1993. As explained in this document,
the analyses have been completed to assure that the general design criteria and the requirements of RG 1.121 are met
during plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preparation of these industry documents and the Braidwood Unit 1 specific WCAP&hyph;14046, all analyses for
leakage and burst potential were completed using the extremely conservative assumption that all Outside Diameter
Stress Corrosion Cracking (ODSCC) indications occur on the tubing freespan. In fact, as indicated in both WCAP&hyph;14046
and EPRI Draft Report TR&hyph;100407, ODSCC degradation is confined to the region of the tube/TSP intersection.
The burst capability of a section of tube containing ODSCC indications and located within the tube/TSP intersection
substantially exceeds the burst capability of a freespan tube section without ODSCC indications. Therefore, tubing
left in service by Braidwood's Unit 1 IPC amendment will not burst when confined by the tube support plates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, it is highly unlikely that a section of tubing within the tube support plate will leak, even with through wall
cracks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure structural integrity of the tubing, even during a MSLB accident, ComEd undertook extensive analyses, presented
as part of WCAP&hyph;14046, to show analytically that the TSP's do not move far enough during a MSLB to allow degraded
tubes to uncover, and subsequently, result in increased leakage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion Analysis is also being conducted and should be submitted
to the NRC by the end of August, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis is being performed using the following assumptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The TSP crevices are clean,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The TSPs are free to move, depending on applied loads, along the length of the SG tube, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Movement of the TSPs along the length of the tube is not restricted by bending or distortion of the SG tube hole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of these base assumptions is extremely conservative in its own right:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. For assumption 1, visual inspections of the secondary side of the tube bundles of Braidwood Unit 1 SGs show some quality
of deposits in the tube to TSP crevice, and along the length of the tube. Since these deposits are considered to be a possible
factor in causing ODSCC, it is likely that any tube having ODSCC indications has deposits in the tube/TSP intersection.
These deposits would tend to close the tube to TSP crevice, restricting by friction the ability of the TSP to move along
the tubes as loads are applied to the TSP during a MSLB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. With regards to assumptions 2 and 3, the TSPs tend to flex and in some locations, are constrained by tie-rods and wedges
attached to the tube bundle shroud. These constraints tend to cause the TSPs to ripple under the applied loads as indicated
in WCAP&hyph;14046. This effect tends to distort the shape of the tube holes, which are fitted to a tight tolerance
around the tubes. Therefore, any distortion of these tube holes caused by motion of the TSP will tend to cause the TSP
to bind against the outside diameter of the tube, further constraining its movement away from the degraded area of
the tubing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of these facts will lessen the ability of the TSP to move, thereby significantly reducing the possibility
that a degraded section of tubing would become uncovered during a MSLB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, this proposed license amendment request does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated within the Braidwood Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of this proposed change does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Removal of
the Amendment 50 and SER operating limits for Unit 1 does not provide a mechanism which could result in a new or different
kind of accident. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a SG in which the IPC has been applied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ComEd has implemented a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per day (gpd) through any one SG to help preclude the
potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational
leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free
span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit will provide for leakage
detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that
is associated with the longest permissible free span crack length. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation
due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during MSLB conditions,
the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at MSLB conditions. Thus, the 105 gpd limit
provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical crack lengths for MSLB conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained upon approval of this amendment request through inservice inspection
and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated is not created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

&cir;F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of MSLB leakage predicted in Braidwood
Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic method of draft NUREG 1477,
with the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 &mu;Ci/gm to 0.35 &mu;Ci/gm. However,
WCAP 14046, docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal, has shown using
the EPRI Leakrate Correlation that projected EOC&hyph;5 MSLB leakage is 3.1 gpm which is less than the allowable limit
of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP&hyph;14046. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus the Unit 1 operating limit imposed by Amendment 50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the 100 day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report
(SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit
derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle
operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging
criteria applied at Braidwood 1.

The values calculated in WCAP&hyph;14046, for BOC 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 POD were used to develop a cycle average burst

The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E&hyph;5 per reactor year with a total contribution
from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E&hyph;8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate
repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution
by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the
calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance
of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability
during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The
EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications.
The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one
volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD
of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.

To further address SG tube burst probability, the following qualitative discussion of limited TSP displacement
is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of ComEd's technical support for the implementation of IPC at Braidwood Unit 1, numerous quantitative analyses
were completed to assure the structural integrity of the SG tubing. These quantitative determinations were provided
as part of WCAP&hyph;14046. These analyses focused on the quantifiable elements of the IPC to evaluate the impact
of crack length on steam generator tube leakage and burst, and were completed consistent with the guidance provided
in draft RG 1.121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bases for these calculations are the analyses completed by the utility industry and reported to the NRC in the EPRI
draft report TR&hyph;100407. As explained in this document, the analyses have been completed to assure that the general
design criteria and the requirements of RG 1.121 are met during plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preparation of these industry documents and the Braidwood Unit 1 specific WCAP&hyph;14046, all analyses for
leakage and burst potential were completed using the extremely conservative assumption that all ODSCC indications
occur on the tubing freespan. In fact, as indicated in both WCAP&hyph;14046 and EPRI Draft Report TR&hyph;100407,
ODSCC degradation is confined to the region of the tube/TSP intersection. The burst capability of a section of tube
containing ODSCC indications and located within the tube/TSP intersection substantially exceeds the burst capability
of a freespan tube section without ODSCC indications. Therefore, tubing left in service by Braidwood's Unit 1 IPC
amendment will not burst when confined by the tube support plates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, it is highly unlikely that a section of tubing within the tube support plate will leak, even with through wall
cracks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure structural integrity of the tubing, even during a MSLB accident, ComEd undertook extensive analyses, presented
as part of WCAP&hyph;14046, to show analytically that the TSPs do not move far enough during a MSLB to allow degraded
tubes to uncover, and subsequently, result in increase leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion Analysis is also being conducted and should be submitted
to the NRC by the end of August, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis is being performed using the following assumptions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The TSP crevices are clean,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The TSPs are free to move, depending on applied loads, along the length of the SG tube, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Movement of the TSPs along the length of the tube is not restricted by bending or distortion of the SG tube hole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of these base assumptions is extremely conservative in its own right:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. For assumption 1, visual inspections of the secondary side of the tube bundles of Braidwood Unit 1 SGs show some quantity
of deposits in the tube to TSP crevice, and along the length of the tube. Since these deposits are considered to be a possible
factor in causing ODSCC, it is likely that any tube having ODSCC indications has deposits in the tube/TSP intersection.
These deposits would tend to close the tube to TSP crevice, restricting by friction the ability of the TSP to move along
the tubes as loads are applied to the TSP during a MSLB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. With regards to assumptions 2 and 3, the TSPs tend to flex and in some locations, are constrained by tie-rods and wedges
attached to the tube bundle shroud. These constraints tend to cause the TSPs to ripple under the applied loads as indicated
in WCAP&hyph;14046. This effect tends to distort the shape of the tube holes, which are fitted to a tight tolerance
around the tubes. Therefore, any distortion of these tube holes caused by motion of the TSP will tend to cause the TSP
to bind against the outside diameter of the tube, further constraining its movement away from the degraded area of
the tubing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of these facts will lessen the ability of the TSP to move, thereby significantly reducing the possibility
that a degraded section of tubing would become uncovered during a MSLB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This evidence, in conjunction with the probability of occurrence of a MSLB, and the probabilistic assessment of the
consequences of a MSLB, results in the substantially increased assurance that the consequences of a MSLB will be significantly
less severe than those assessed in WCAP&hyph;14046 and the generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion
Analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the pertinent portions of the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears
that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. This staff finding is partially based on the licensee's
usage of a constant value for the Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.6 as recommended in draft NUREG&hyph;1447. This
is consistent with the staff's position in the Safety Evaluation (SE) it issued in support of Amendment No. 50 to the
Braidwood, Unit 1, operating license. While the licensee also discussed in its analysis the usage of a higher value
for the POD, the staff did not rely on this. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request
involves no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By August 10, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Wilmington Township Public Library, 201 S. Kankakee Street,
Wilmington, Illinois 60481. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

Introduction and Authority

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 3(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (RTC Completion Act), Public Law No. 93&hyph;204,
enacted on December 17, 1993, added a new subparagraph (C) to &sect;21A(b)(4) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12
U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4), which requires the RTC to implement and maintain a program, in a manner acceptable to the Thrift
Depositor Protection Oversight Board (Oversight Board), to provide an appeals process for business and commercial
borrowers to appeal decisions by the RTC, when acting as conservator of an insured depository institution, which
would have the effect of terminating or otherwise adversely affecting credit or loan agreements, lines of credit,
and similar arrangements with such borrowers who have not defaulted on their obligations to the institution in conservatorship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC submitted this Policy on Procedures for Non-defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions
of the RTC Acting as Conservator to the Oversight Board for consideration at its June 16, 1994 meeting. The Oversight
Board adopted a resolution approving the policy at that meeting. In that resolution the Oversight Board suggested
that the RTC make the public aware of the new policy through publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RTC is rapidly resolving the remaining institutions it operates in conservatorships. Inasmuch as the policy
affects only the operation of those institutions in conservatorship, there is a critical need to make the public aware
of this new policy quickly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the request of the Oversight Board and the need to publicize the policy quickly, the RTC has concluded that
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be the best means of disseminating the new policy to members of the public with an interest in the subject matter.

Policy on Procedures for Non-Defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions of the RTC Acting
as Conservator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RTC is issuing procedures which provide a process for non-defaulting business and commercial borrowers to appeal
the RTC's decisions (when acting as a conservator) which terminate or otherwise adversely affect credit or loan agreements,
lines of credit or other similar arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appeals process outlined herein pertains to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting commercial
borrower made by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution for which the RTC was acting as conservator
on or after December 17, 1993. These procedures shall only apply to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting
commercial borrower made on or after December 17, 1993 by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution
and only during the period for which the RTC acts as conservator for such insured depository institution. The appeals
process is not intended to deny borrowers any rights otherwise provided under law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appeals process described in this policy does not limit or affect the exercise by the RTC, as conservator or receiver,
of its authority to repudiate contracts pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &sect;1821(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, a predecessor institution retains the obligation to fund unfunded or partially funded loan commitments,
and such obligations are not transferred to or assumed by the new savings association which the RTC operates in conservatorship.
However, it has also been the RTC's policy for the conservator to consider funding partially funded loan commitments,
as generally outlined in the Asset Management and Disposition Manual, Circular 10100.1, Change-One, Section F(3),
and as further detailed with respect to the handling of construction loans in Circular 10100.32, Subject: ``Funding
of ADC Loan Commitments,'' which can be obtained upon request to one of the above listed contacts or from one of the public
reading rooms of the RTC. These practices will continue. Pursuant to Section 21A(b)(4)(C) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as added by Section 3(b) of the RTC Completion Act, effective December 17, 1993, whenever the RTC acting as
conservator decides to deny an extension of credit to a non-defaulting commercial borrower, the borrower shall have
an opportunity to appeal the decision to the next level of authority above the initial decision maker, as described
below.

IV. General Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Right of Appeal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have the right to appeal an adverse credit decision made by a Managing
Agent or other person or entity authorized to act on behalf of the RTC as conservator of an insured depository institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Notice to Non-Defaulting Commercial Borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Managing Agent or other person or entity authorized to act on behalf of the RTC as conservator shall give notice to
a non-defaulting commercial borrower of (1) any adverse credit decision within the scope of this directive as outlined
in the Paragraph I above, and (2) the right to appeal such decision. The notice should be sent via certified/registered
mail-return receipt requested to document receipt by the borrower. (Two sample forms of such notice are included
as Appendices A and B.) This notice is in addition to any notice by the conservator terminating a line of credit, or other
credit agreement, or notice by the receiver of the predecessor institution repudiating a loan commitment or other
credit agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Procedure for the Appeal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Senior Credit Review Committee of the field office with jurisdiction over the conservatorship shall normally
decide the appeal of the non-defaulting commercial borrower. However, if the adverse credit decision under appeal
was made by a field office's Senior Review Committee, or by a person or entity at a level of authority above the field
office Senior Credit Review Committee, then the person or entity at the next level of authority above the initial decision
maker, as determined by the RTC's delegations of authority, shall decide the appeal of the non-defaulting borrower.
(The person or entity deciding the appeal is hereafter referred to as the ``hearer of the appeal.'')
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must file an appeal, in writing, with the hearer of the appeal within 60 calendar
days of receipt of the notice described in subparagraph IV.B above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must state the grounds for the appeal. The non-defaulting commercial borrower
may submit only documentary evidence in support of the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The hearer of the appeal shall make a good faith effort to decide the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of
the appeal and all documentation necessary to act on the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) (a) The record of an appeal shall consist of the written appeal and documentary evidence submitted by the non-defaulting
commercial borrower and any other evidence and information within the possession or control of the RTC that relates
to the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have the right to review any documentation submitted by such borrower,
along with the appeal or prior to the filing of the appeal, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the RTC's records.
The hearer of the appeal may extend the period for deciding the appeal of such reasonable time as may be necessary to
permit any such review of the documentation submitted by the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The hearer of the appeal may reverse an adverse credit decision if the hearer determines that (a) the extension
of credit is likely to reduce a conservatorship's overall losses, or (b) the extension of credit would not be likely
to increase the conservatorship's overall losses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) As a condition to reversing the adverse credit decision, the hearer of the appeal may require the non-defaulting
commercial borrower to release any related claim against the receiver for a predecessor institution, in whole or
in part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The hearer of the appeal shall provide written notice of the decision, including an explanation of any negative
ruling, to the relevant Managing Agent, Field Office Claims Department, and to the non-defaulting commercial borrower.
The RTC will make a good faith effort to provide such notice within 30 calendar days of receiving the Appeal Letter and
all other information necessary to act on the appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Appeal Log
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A log should be maintained in each conservatorship to track each appeal under this procedure. Entries in the log, to
be initiated upon receipt of the borrower's appeal, shall include the following items: borrower's name, date of credit
application, date of adverse credit decision, decision by whom, date borrower's appeal received, hearer the of appeal,
date of hearer's decision, date borrower notified of decision, and remarks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Appointment of Receiver
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the appointment of a receiver for the depository institution operated in conservatorship by the RTC, with respect
to such institution, the right of all non-defaulting commercial borrowers to appeal (and any pending appeal) under
this process terminates. Thereafter, any rights of the non-defaulting commercial borrowers, with respect to such
depository institution, are governed by 12 U.S.C. &sect;1821(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. No Further Appeal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have no right to appeal the decision of the hearer of the appeal within
the RTC or to any court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. No Effect on RTC's Rights as Receiver or Conservator
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to waive or alter the rights of the RTC as conservator or receiver
with respect to any commercial borrower or any insured depository institution. Such rights include, by way of illustration
only, the rights to repudiate contracts, to leave obligations and liabilities with the receiver of the predecessor
institution and to require non-defaulting commercial borrowers to adhere to the receivership claims procedures
of the RTC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of an appeal with the hearer of the appeal in accordance with the appeal procedures outlined in subparagraph
IV.C above does not preserve, and does not substitute for, the requirement that a claim be filed and the claims process
be pursued with respect to any claim against: (1) the receiver for any predecessor institution, or (2) the receiver
for the depository institution operated in conservatorship if a receiver is appointed for such institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Responsibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RTC Field Office Vice Presidents are responsible for ensuring that all conservatorships, SAMDA contractors, commercial
loan servicers, other commercial loan managers, and appropriate RTC staff are aware of and comply with this policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective [date], the Office of Thrift Supervision appointed the Resolution Trust Corporation as Receiver for [Predecessor
Institution]. Concurrently with such appointment, a new federal mutual association was formed, [name of de novo
institution], and the Resolution Trust Corporation was appointed Conservator of the [name of de novo institution]
(the ``Conservator''). Most of the assets of [Predecessor Institution] were acquired by the Conservator in consideration
of the assumption by the Conservator of some, but not all, of the liabilities of the [Predecessor Institution]. The
Conservator DID NOT, however, assume the obligation to continue to fund your loan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
{
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, and as you were informed in another letter the Receiver for [Predecessor Institution] has repudiated the loan agreement
and terminated any obligation to continue to fund your loan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
}
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 You may have a claim against the Receiver of [Predecessor Institution] for the unfunded loan amount. You must follow
any instructions from the receiver regarding the filing of such claim.

Notwithstanding that the Conservator has no obligation to continue to fund your loan, the Conservator has the discretion
to provide funds to you through a new extension of credit, when the Conservator determines, in its sole discretion,
that it is in the best interest of the Conservator to provide those funds. However, the Conservator has decided not
to provide funds to you.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because you are a non-defaulting commercial borrower of [name of the predecessor institution], section 21A(b)(4)(C)
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act provides you with an opportunity to appeal this adverse credit decision of the Conservator.
You must submit your appeal in writing to the hearer of the appeal, set forth below, within 60 days of receipt of this
notice, stating the grounds for your appeal. In support of your appeal, you may submit documentary evidence, which
must be submitted at the same time as your letter of appeal. The hearer of the appeal will conduct no evidentiary hearing.
A copy of the RTC's policy on borrower appeals is attached for your information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You should know that the hearer of the appeal may only reverse the adverse credit decision if the hearer determines
that to do so would reduce, or would not increase, the overall losses to the RTC as Conservator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will allow Amex to implement a program, in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(``NYSE'') and the National Securities Clearing Corportion (``NSCC''), to compare all Amex equity trades on trade
date. Amex will phase-in the program commencing June 30, 1994, with full implementation scheduled for June 30, 1995.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filings with the Commission, Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule changes and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1988, Amex has sought to improve its clearing operations and to reduce exposure to loss through market volatility
by reducing the comparison cycle in stocks and in options. The Amex has reduced the comparison times first from five
business days to three business days and then to one business day after the trade date. For the past five years, the Amex,
in conjunction with the NYSE, has been working with the member firm community and the NSCC to establish operational
parameters, systems, and rules for shortening trade comparison time frames. In 1989, the Amex adopted Rule 719, which
requires next-day comparison (``T+1'') of exchange transactions, and developed its Intra-Day Comparison (``IDC'')
System, which is an electronic system designed to match trade sides and to resolve uncompared trades known as ``don't
knows'' or ``DKs.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The IDC System is used by Amex for both equities and options.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27851 (March 27, 1990), 55 FR 12759 [File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;89&hyph;05]
(order approving proposed rule change).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex now proposes to implement, again in conjunction with NYSE and NSCC, trade-date comparison of Amex equity
transactions. Trade-date comparison will be implemented in phases with a final target date of June 30, 1995. The first
phase of this program is scheduled to be implemented by the end of June 1994. When the first phase has been implemented,
the Amex will require all member firms to input equity trade data into the IDC System every two hours on the date of the
trade rather than once daily. Input times will be 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Amex member firms already
are submitting option trade data into the IDC System on trade-date on an hourly basis. The IDC System will continue
to be the main processor of the comparison data. The Amex will transmit the compared trades to a registered clearing
agency in order to complete the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex is not proposing any written changes to its rules at this time. Amex Rule 719(a), which currently requires
each transaction effected on the Amex to be compared or closed out no later than close-of-business on T+1, will remain
in effect for the present time. The Amex believes that its Rule 719(c), which requires members to submit trade data
as may be required by the Amex, provides it with sufficient authority to require clearing members to submit trade data
in listed stocks and options for comparison by such times as Amex may prescribe. However, as the final implementation
date of June 30, 1995, approaches, Amex will file any other rule changes with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)
of the Act
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 as are necessary or appropraite to implement the trade-date comparison program. As indicated above, any such Amex
rule changes will be developed in conjunction with the NYSE and NSCC, and Amex will work with the NYSE and NSCC to achieve
uniformity and to monitor the implementation of each phase of this program.

The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (as long
as five business days for equity transactions until 1990) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October
1987. The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade
processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during
the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts
to compare all trades on trade date.

Since 1988, the Amex, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated
with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The Amex reduced its comparison
cycle in stocks first from T+5 to T+3 and then to T+1 in 1990.

As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change which shortens the Amex comparison cycle from
T+1 to trade date will make Amex's comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility
and more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in post-trade processing. The Commission believes that
the proposal will offer additional protection to investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors'
funds and facilitate investors' transactions. In the Commission's view, this proposal will provide fundamental
and important improvements to the marketplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filings in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Trade-date comparison is to be phased-in by both Amex and NYSE on a parallel schedule, and the NYSE has begun some aspects
of its phase-in program.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Accelerated approval of this proposal will permit Amex, as well as the NYSE and NSCC, to provide their clearing members
with a more coordinated implementation of trade-date comparison. Furthermore, because neither the Commission
nor NYSE received any written comments on the NYSE's proposal, which was very similar to the Amex's proposal, and because
the Amex did not receive any comments from its members in response to its Information Circular,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission does not expect to receive any comments on this proposal. Therefore, the Commission believes there
is good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice
of the filing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(a) Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The PORTAL Market is the market operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., for the quotation of securities that are
restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or are
securities that are treated as if restricted.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In order to qualify for inclusion in The PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must
be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, 
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification
number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class.

Part II, PORTAL Rules, provides that to qualify for initial designation and continued designation in the PORTAL Market,
a security shall be either a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, or a security
that upon issuance and continually thereafter only can be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act,
Rule 114A, or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 of the Securities Act and not involving any public offering.

This provision requires that the security meet the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) and (4) under the Securities Act,
which are, respectively, the ``fungibility'' and ``information delivery requirement'' conditions of Rule 114A.

The PORTAL Market has processed over one thousand applications for designation as a PORTAL security. Designation
of a security as a PORTAL security permits the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation
and be cleared and settled through the Depository Trust Company. Section 2 of the PORTAL Rules permits any PORTAL participant
to submit an application for security designation, rather than the issuer of the security. ``PORTAL participants''
include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories of PORTAL participants are
required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the Exchange Act and members
of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that are not members of the NASD
that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NASD has operated The PORTAL Market since it initiated operations in June 1990 without the imposition of any fees
on users. The NASD is proposing to adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each
security identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. Many private offerings of securities are of securities
that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which is treated as a separate security, even though part of a single private
offering, and assigned a separate identification symbol by The PORTAL Market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing
costs associated with the operation of the PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing
of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review
of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that
the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of the PORTAL Rules, as set forth above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications are generally submitted the day prior to commencing the private placement or the day prior to conducting
a ``road show,'' if such a road show is used, and approval is necessary within one or two days at the most.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, because of a continuing lack of knowledge regarding the procedures for obtaining approval for PORTAL
designation, Depository Trust Company book-entry approval, and the issuance of a CUSIP number from Standard &amp;
Poor's, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff must work closely with the applicant to complete the process. Further,
private offerings that rely on Rule 144A for redistribution of the securities to qualified institutional buyers
are many times unique in their structure, as well as frequently involving issues related to SEC Regulation S and compliance
with the CUSIP identification number requirement when an offshore offering occurs simultaneously with a U.S. private
placement. Finally, there are many issues with multiple tranches, each of which must be assigned a separate security
symbol. Given the efforts required by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD belies that the fees as proposed
are appropriate.

(b) Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Exchange
Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates
or controls in that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications submitted by PORTAL
dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in The PORTAL Market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Connecticut Light and Power Company (``CL&amp;P''), Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, an electric public-utility
subsidiary company of Northwest Utilities, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment
under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6(a)
and 5 of the Act and rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated December 16, 1986 (HCAR No. 24263), the Commission authorized CL&amp;P, among other things, to issue
a promissory note up to an aggregate principal amount of $25 million to the Industrial Development Authority of the
State of New Hampshire (``IDA''). The note evidenced IDA's loan to CL&amp;P of the proceeds from pollution control
revenue bonds (``Bonds'') issued by IDA to finance the cost of acquiring, constructing and installing certain pollution
control facilities and/or sewage or solid waste disposal facilities at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, Unit
No. 1 in Seabrook, New Hampshire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to improve the credit ratings of the Bonds, CL&amp;P obtained a letter of credit (``LOC'') from the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Limited (``Credit Bank''). Subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds, Credit Bank's rating in the
financial markets deteriorated. CL&amp;P has been informed that many institutional investors that otherwise would
be interested in purchasing the bonds will not purchase securities secured by letters of credit issued by the Credit
Bank, and investors that are still willing to purchase the Bonds are demanding an interest rate premium that is causing
CL&amp;P's effective interest cost to be higher than it would have otherwise been using a bank with a higher rating.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CL&amp;P now seeks authority to: (1) replace Credit Bank LOC and the Bank Reimbursement Agreement with a new Letter
of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (``Substitute Agreement''); (2) replace the LOC with a new letter of Credit
(``New LOC''); and subsequently thereto (3) extend, modify, or replace the Substitute Agreement and the New LOC from
time to time during the term of the bonds supported thereby. The terms of any such extensions, modifications or replacements,
including the New LOC and the Substitute Agreement, shall provide that (a) the total amount available to be drawn under
any such extended, modified or replacement letter of credit does not exceed $16.2 million, representing principal
in the amount of $15.4 million and interest in the amount of $800,000 calculated at the maximum rate of 15% for 123 days,
(b) the annual letter of credit costs applicable to any such extension, modification, or replacement do not exceed
1% per annum of the total amount available to be drawn under the extended, modified or replacement letter of credit,
and (c) the reimbursement agreement applicable to any such extension, modification or replacement shall provide
(or shall afford CL&amp;P the option to elect) that tender advances tear interest until paid at a rate not to exceed
the higher of the prime rate plus 2% or the federal funds rate plus 2%, (d) such extension, modification or replacement
is otherwise on terms that are substantially similar in all material respects to those applicable to the New LOC and
Substitute Agreement (or previous extensions or modifications thereof or replacements therefore proposed to be
entered into in connection with the replacement of Credit Bank, and (e) CL&amp;P shall have obtained all necessary
State Commission approvals applicable to such extension, modification or replacement.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70&hyph;8167)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, a registered
holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder to its
declaration previously filed under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By order dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) (``April Order''), the Commission authorized CNG to issue and sell on
or before June 30, 1995 up to $400 million principal amount of debentures (``Debentures'') in one or more series at
a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which would be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and
at an interest rate which would be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Debentures would mature in not more than
thirty years and would be issued in accordance with the indenture between CNG and Chemical Bank (successor by merger
to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee, dated May 1, 1971 (``Indenture''). CNG has sold $300 million
of Debentures under the April Order, thus $100 million of Debentures remains authorized for issue and sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG now proposes to change its Indenture by adding section 4.02 so that it may reserve the right, without the consent
of the holders of future debenture issues sold under the April Order, to amend sections 6.06 and 6.07 of the Indenture.
New section 4.02 provides:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate corporate action, but without consent, approval or other
action by holders of debentures of any series created after May 1, 1994, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as
heretofore supplemented and amended, as shall be necessary in order to amend Sections 6.06 and 6.07 thereof so as to
modify or eliminate the provisions or requirements of such Sections, or any part thereof and the definition of any
term used in either of such Sections or related thereto, as the Company may determine in its sole discretion.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6.06 provides that funded debt (as defined) cannot be incurred and subsidiary preferred stock cannot be issued
unless: (1) The consolidated income available for interest and subsidiary preferred stock dividends of CNG and its
subsidiaries for any 12 consecutive months within 15 months immediately preceding the date additional funded debt
is incurred is not less than 21/2 times the sum of the total annual interest charges and the total subsidiary preferred
stock dividends, assuming the incurrence of such additional funded debt or issuance of such preferred stock, as the
case may be; and (2) after giving effect to the incurring of the additional funded debt and issuance of preferred stock,
the sum of the outstanding consolidated debt of CNG and its subsidiaries and the amount of outstanding subsidiary
preferred stock shall not be more than 60% of the consolidated net tangible assets of CNG and its subsidiaries. Section
6.07 provides that a subsidiary of CNG cannot incur funded debt or issue preferred stock to a third party unless funded
debt and preferred stock of the subsidiary will not exceed 60% of the total capitalization of the subsidiary, and the
principal amount of funded debt and amount of preferred stock of all subsidiaries of CNG shall not exceed 15% of consolidated
net tangible assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNG also requests authorization to extend the expiration date for the issuance and sale of the remaining $100 million
principal amount of Debentures under the April Order from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 1996.

Columbia now proposes to increase the amount of short-term financing for Ohio $40 million. These short-term borrowings
will have the same terms and conditions as those authorized by the September Order. Thus, Ohio proposes to borrow the
funds directly from Columbia and/or from certain other subsidiaries of Columbia through Columbia's intrasystem
money pool (``Money Pool''), and Columbia requests authority to loan to its subsidiaries an additional $40 million
for short-term borrowings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Money Pool provides a vehicle by which Columbia and its subsidiary companies loan their excess cash to their associate
companies. Funds would be advanced, repaid, and reborrowed as required through December 31, 1994, with all such advances
to be fully repaid by April 30, 1995. All short-term borrowings from Columbia and/or the Money Pool will be evidenced
by a promissory note (``Short-Term Note'' and ``Money Pool Note'', respectively). A default rate of 2% per annum above
the pre-default rate on unpaid principal or interest amounts will be assessed if any interest or principal payment
becomes past due.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interest rate charged on all Short-Term Notes and Money Pool Notes, and the investment rate earned on moneys invested
in the Money Pool, will be the interest rate per annum equal to the composite weighted average effective rate on short-term
transactions of Columbia and/or the Money Pool short-term investment rate. During any month, this composite rate
may be based on one or any combination of: (1) The cost of Columbia's borrowings under its bank facility; (2) the interest
rate earned by Columbia on invested excess cash; and/or (3) the interest rate earned by subsidiaries on investments
of excess Money Pool funds.

The Southern Company (``Southern''), 64 Perimeter Center East, Atlanta, Georgia 30346, a registered holding company,
has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5)
thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes to acquire the securities of one or more companies (``Project Parents'') engaged directly or indirectly,
and exclusively, in the business of owning and holding the securities of ``foreign utility companies'' (``FUCOs''),
as defined in Section 33(a) of the Act, and ``exempt wholesale generators'' (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32(a)
of the Act. Southern requests that the authorization for its proposals remain effective until the earlier of: (i)
December 31, 1996; and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission that
would exempt the acquisition of any securities of any Project Parent from the requirements of Sections 9(a) and 10
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that a Project Parent may be organized at the time of, and in order to facilitate: the making of bids
or proposals to acquire an interest in any EWG or FUCO (``Exempt Subsidiaries''); after the award of a bid proposal,
in order to facilitate closing on the purchase or financing of any such Exempt Subsidiary; or at any time subsequent
to the consummation of an acquisition of an interest in an Exempt Subsidiary. A Project Parent would be formed after
the acquisition of an Exempt Subsidiary in order to: effect an adjustment in the respective ownership interests in
any Exempt Subsidiary held by Southern and unaffiliated co-investors; facilitate a partial sale of an interest in
any such Exempt Subsidiary; comply with applicable laws of foreign jurisdictions limiting or otherwise relating
to the ownership of domestic companies by foreign nationals; or, to limit Southern's exposure to U.S. and foreign
taxes as part of tax planning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern requests authority to make direct or indirect investments in Project Parents in an aggregate amount at any
one time outstanding not to exceed $400 million. Any such direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project
Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof, and giving effect thereto, Southern's ``aggregate investment,''
determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of Southern's
``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule 53(a)(1)(ii). In addition, any such investment in any particular
Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection with making
the underlying investment in any Exempt Subsidiary (or Exempt Subsidiaries) with respect to which such Project Parent
was organized or formed, taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs, and cash reserves
required to be maintained in accordance with financing documents. Southern states that it will also comply with all
other applicable rules under the Act, including, without limitation, such rules as may be promulgated in the future
pursuant to Sections 32 and 33.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that investments by Southern in any Project Parents may take the form of any combination of the following:
(i) Ppurchases of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing
under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable; (ii) cash capital contributions or open account advances;
(iii) loans evidenced by promissory notes; and (iv) guaranties by Southern of the principal of or interest on any promissory
notes or other evidences of indebtedness of any Project Parent issued to lenders other than Southern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes that any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have
a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value, and that any open account advance made
by Southern to a Project Parent be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the date of the advance. Southern
also proposes that any promissory note issued by a Project Parent to Southern, and any promissory note or similar evidence
of indebtedness with respect to which Southern may issue a guaranty, would mature not later than 30 years after the
date of insurance, and would bear interest at a rate: (a) Not greater than the prime rate at a bank to be designated by
Southern in the case of any promissory note issued to Southern, and (b) not greater than 3% over such prime rate in the
case of any note or similar evidence of indebtedness guarantied by Southern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any promissory note issued to Southern by any Project Parent may, at Southern's option, be converted to a capital contribution
to such Project Parent through Southern's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds for any direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project Parent (including the guaranty of any securities
of any Project Parent) will be derived from: (i) The sale of common stock or the issuance of guarantees (within the limitations
of HCAR No. 25980 (January 25, 1994), or in any future authorization obtained from the Commission); (ii) bank borrowings
or commercial paper sales (within the limitations of HCAR No. 26004 (March 15, 1994), or any future authorization
obtained from the Commission); and, (iii) available cash. Southern is not requesting the authority to issue any additional
securities for the purpose of financing investments in any Project Parents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that it is currently investigating potential opportunities to acquire or construct electric generation,
transmission or distribution facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. Southern believes that,
in almost all cases, such facilities will qualify as facilities that a FUCO may own or operate.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Southern states that it has been Southern's experience, in connection with its foreign project development activities
to date, including the preparation and submission of bid proposals in foreign government privatization programs,
that the formation and acquisition of one or more Project Parents (usually, but not always, foreign corporations
or the equivalent thereof) is necessary or desirable to facilitate the acquisition and ownership of a FUCO. For example,
laws of some foreign countries may require that the bidder in a privatization program be a domestic company. In such
cases, it would be necessary for Southern to form a foreign subsidiary as the entity submitting the bid or other proposal.

In some instances, a foreign utility facility may also qualify as an ``eligible facility,'' as defined in Section
32(a)(2) of the Act. Depending upon various facts and circumstances, Southern may in the future pursue any particular
foreign utility investment opportunity as an EWG rather than as a FUCO, in which case the requisite filing or filings
would be made with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern states that there would typically be other business reasons for creating Project Parents. Southern states
that, for example, the interposition of one or more wholly-owned Project Parents may be necessary to minimize U.S.
income taxes (e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable
tax treaties among foreign countries). Further, Project Parents are useful in cases in which Southern may bid as a
part of a consortium of companies, since each member of the consortium will typically want to have at least one consolidated
subsidiary in the final FUCO ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Finally, Project Parents serve
to isolate business risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among or by the members of
the ownership group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern proposes herein that a Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests in both FUCOs
and EWGs.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The ability to combine ownership of both FUCOs and EWGs under a single company will enable Southern to minimize the
number of separate intermediate subsidiaries needed in connection with its investments in EWGs and FUCOs.

An entity engaged exclusively in the business of holding the securities of one or more EWGs may itself seek a determination

of both EWGs and FUCOs.

Southern states that, within 45 days after Southern determines that the purposes for owning any Project Parent no
longer exists, it shall liquidate or dissolve such Project Parent, unless, within that time, Southern determines
that such Project Parent may be used in conjunction with a proposal or plan to acquire an interest in a different Exempt
Subsidiary. Southern requests authority to liquidate or dissolve any Project Parent under such circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern also requests approval for any Project Parent to issue equity securities and debt securities to persons
other than Southern (and with respect to which there is no recourse to Southern), including banks, insurance companies,
and other financial institutions, exclusively for the purpose of financing (including any refinancing of) investments
in Exempt Subsidiaries. Such securities may be issued in one or more transactions from time to time through the earlier
to occur of (i) December 31, 1996, and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission
exempting such transaction from the application requirements under the Act. It is proposed that the aggregate principal
amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project Parents to persons other than Southern will not exceed $800
million at any one time outstanding. No more than $200 million principal amount of such non-recourse debt securities
at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In any case in which Southern directly
or indirectly owns less than all of the equity interests of a Project Parent, only that portion of the non-recourse
indebtedness of such Project Parent equal to Southern's equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes
of the foregoing limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to any party other than Southern may include capital shares, partnership
interests, trust certificiates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable foreign law. Non-recourse
debt securities issued to parties other than Southern may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated
notes, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either
U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern states that the amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including interest rate, maturity,
prepayment or redemption privileges, and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would
be negotiated on a case by case basis, taking into account differences from project to project in optimum debt-equity
ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives, and other similar financial and performance
characteristics of each project. Accordingly, Southern requests the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions
of such securities without further approval by the Commission.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Southern states that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued
or sold by a Project Parent for a consideration that is less than such par value. Southern also states that no note, bond
or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature later than 30 years from the date
of issuance thereof, and will bear interest at a rate exceeding the following: (i) if such note, bond or other indebtedness
is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the yield to maturity on an actively traded, non-callable,
U.S. Treasury note having a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other indebtedness (``Applicable
Treasury Rate''),
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the then applicable prime rate at a U.S. money center bank to be designated
by Southern (``Applicable Prime Rate''); and (ii) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency
of a country other than the United States, at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing
rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country, would be equivalent
to a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable
Treasury Rate or Applicable Prime Rate, as the case may be.

If there is no actively traded U.S. Treasury note with a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other
evidence of indebtedness, then the Applicable Treasury Rate would be determined by interpolating linearly with
reference to the yields to maturity on actively traded, non-callable, Treasury notes having maturities near (i.e.,
both shorter and longer than) such average life.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In connection with the issuance of any non-recourse debt securities by any Project Parent, it is anticipated that
such Project Parent may grant security in its assets. Such security interest may take the form of a pledge of the shares
or other equity securities of an Exempt Subsidiary that it owns, including a security interest in any distributions
from any such Exempt Subsidiary, or a collateral assignment of its rights under and interests in other property, including
rights under contracts. It is also anticipated that fees in the form of placement or commitment fees, or other similar
fees, would be paid to lenders, placement agents, or others in connection with the issuance of any such non-recourse
debt securities. Southern requests authority for any Project Parent to agree in any case to pay placement or commitment
fees, and other similar fees, in connection with any borrowing, provided that the effective annual interest charge
on any indebtedness evidencing such borrowing is not greater than 115% of the stated interest rate thereon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with investments in Exempt Subsidiaries, Southern states that it is typical that a portion of the capital
requirements of any such Exempt Subsidiary would be obtained through non-recourse financing involving borrowings
from banks and other financial institutions. Southern also states that, in some cases, however, it may be necessary
or desirable to structure an investment in an Exempt Subsidiary such that the obligations created are not those of
the Exempt Subsidiary, but instead those of its parent companies. For example, in a consortium of non-affiliated
companies bidding to purchase the securities or assets of an EWG or FUCO, each of the consortium members would be obligated
to fund its respective share of the proposed purchase price. If external sources of funds are needed for this purpose,
a participant in the consortium may choose to engage in non-recourse financing through one or more single-purpose
subsidiaries that would then utilize the proceeds of the financing to acquire an ownership interest in the Exempt
Subsidiary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This FHWA policy statement on life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) helps fulfill Federal management responsibilities
for analyzing life-cycle cost aspects of infrastructure investment decisions under Executive Order 12893, ``Principles
of Federal Infrastructure Investment.'' The policy statement establishes LCCA principles to be applied by FHWA
in infrastructure investment analyses, and in evaluating the adequacy of State highway agency procedures used in
conducting required LCCA for investments funded through the Federal-aid highway program. States and local agencies
are expected to apply these principles in evaluating program and project level investment decisions involving Federal-aid
highway funds as required under applicable FHWA regulations. Comments are solicited on potential problems in implementing
provisions of this policy statement and specific needs for training and technical assistance in LCCA.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is an increasing recognition that total life-cycle costs of highway and transportation investments must be
given greater consideration in all phases of highway programs. Executive Order 12893, ``Principles of Federal Infrastructure
Investment,'' requires that benefits and costs of infrastructure investment be measured and appropriately discounted
over the full life cycle of each project. Sections 1024 and 1025 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1977) also require consideration of ``the use of life-cycle
cost in the design and engineering of bridges, tunnels, or pavement.'' Subpart B of the interim final rule on implementation
of ISTEA management systems (23 CFR 500.207) requires use of LCCA for pavement management systems (PMS) and Subpart
C (23 CFR 500.307) requires use of LCCA or comparable techniques for bridge management systems (BMS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life-cycle cost analysis is an economic evaluation of all current and future costs associated with investment alternatives.
It is a valuable economic analysis technique for evaluating highway and other transportation programs and projects
that require long-term capital and maintenance expenditures over the extended lives of facilities. Future costs
are discounted using an appropriate discount rate to compare costs incurred at different points in time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life-cycle cost analysis principles and techniques are used in many types of economic analysis to compare benefits
and costs arising at different points in time. Benefit-cost analysis and cost effectiveness analysis, for instance,
use life-cycle cost analysis principles to discount future benefits and costs of investment alternatives over the
lives of alternatives being evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Life-cycle cost analysis is used to evaluate programs of pavement and bridge improvements as well as individual projects.
It is an important input to estimates of future funding requirements and to the development of improvement programs,
especially when there are budget constraints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of value engineering is receiving increased attention as a technique for analyzing the functions of a program,
project, system, product, or service to identify opportunities to significantly lower costs while still achieving
the essential functions. Life-cycle costs are often analyzed to ensure that unnecessary costs are avoided by considering
future operations, maintenance, and reconstruction requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Total life-cycle costs of specific facilities may be many times the initial construction costs when user costs are
considered. It is essential that a long term perspective be taken in programming improvements, selecting among alternative
maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction strategies, and designing pavements, structures, and other
highway elements. Longer design lives may have to be considered, and traditional strategies for programming maintenance
and rehabilitation activities may have to be reevaluated to determine whether they adequately consider future costs,
including user delay-related costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing congestion on important highways in urban areas and some rural areas makes it critical to fully consider
life-cycle costs of investment decisions. Safety concerns and auxiliary construction costs to maintain, rehabilitate,
or reconstruct congested highways and bridges under traffic are very high. User costs and delays around work zones
in congested areas may be even higher and represent significant inefficiencies that may adversely affect economic
productivity, especially on the National Highway System (NHS). These delays can erode productivity gains realized
by the growing number of industries using just-in-time and other advanced logistics strategies that depend on efficient
and predictable transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of whether user costs are included in a formal LCCA, most States already implicitly consider user costs
when they choose to pay premiums to maintain traffic through work zones or design more durable pavements in congested
urban areas. Including user costs in LCCA makes these implicit considerations explicit, and may help identify other
opportunities to reduce overall agency and user costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognition of the high future costs to maintain and rehabilitate highways, bridges and tunnels, and their associated
traffic control, safety, environmental, and hydraulic components has led to increased interest in the potential
for LCCA to improve investment productivity and reduce public and private costs of highway and other transportation
programs. The FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) jointly
sponsored a symposium in December 1993 to learn more about LCCA practices among the States and to identify research,
training, technical assistance, and policy-related needs to improve LCCA application. An important input to that
symposium was an AASHTO survey of State LCCA practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many specific LCCA issues and research needs were identified at the symposium. Key technical issues included how
to establish the appropriate analysis period, how to value and properly consider user costs, and how to choose the
appropriate discount rate. Participants also identified important research and data needed to predict pavement
and bridge performance and forecast future traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An important policy issue raised at the symposium was the recognition that results of LCCA may favor selection of improvements
with higher initial costs in order to achieve significant long term savings in overall investment requirements.
It may indicate, for instance, that more projects warrant reconstruction rather than rehabilitation strategies,
that early intervention with preventive maintenance is cost effective, or that somewhat higher designs or levels
of service may be appropriate for some facilities. The FHWA recognizes that LCCA, thus, may result in proposals for
greater expenditures up front. At the same time virtually all transportation agencies will continue to face budgetary
limitations at least over the short term. Life-cycle cost analysis will help agencies identify and explain the real
costs borne by transportation users of inadequate infrastructure funding. Furthermore, LCCA can assist agencies
that face fiscal constraints in making the best use of available funds. Several States already use LCCA in developing
network improvement programs as part of their pavement and bridge management systems. Eventually it is desirable
for all States to have such capabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following paragraphs highlight key principles of good LCCA practice. Applying these principles generally will
allow States and local agencies to identify investment alternatives that will minimize total life-cycle costs.
While their use is not mandatory in all instances, States are strongly encouraged to apply these principles in conducting
life-cycle cost analyses unless there are unique characteristics of particular programs or projects that require
principles to be modified. Life-cycle cost analysis, of course, is only one consideration in many investment decisions,
but it certainly is one of the most important for NHS routes and other high volume roads in light of the costs and lost
productivity associated with future maintenance and rehabilitation actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general there are no hard and fast rules concerning the appropriate length of the analysis period. The analysis
period will vary depending on the type of improvement (bridge, versus tunnel, versus pavement), the location (urban
versus rural), the highway system (NHS versus other), and the design lives of all appropriate alternatives. In general,
longer design lives should be considered for improvements on the NHS and other high volume urban roadways because
future agency and user costs associated with maintenance and rehabilitation activities may be so high. For pavement
improvements on the NHS, design lives of 50 years may be reasonable while bridge and tunnel improvements may have design
lives of 100 or more years. The consideration of longer design lives will require longer analysis periods in LCCA.
Analysis periods for projects involving other modes generally should be long enough to cover the full life-expectancy
of the investment_the time until facilities would have to be reconstructed if initially constructed to an optimum
design. These lives would vary according to the modal alternative being examined. Analysis periods for all project
alternatives should be the same length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of user costs in LCCA is particularly controversial among some States. Part of the controversy over
user costs is the fact that they often are many times higher than agency costs and can critically influence decisions.
While all motorists do not value costs of delays as highly as do commercial travelers, the costs and lost productivity
to businesses of delays around work zones are simply too high to ignore. In fact, such delays arguably have a greater
impact on business than delays associated with inadequate capacity because businesses factor normal congestion
costs into their plans, but delays around work zones generally cannot be foreseen and thus are more disruptive. Technical
advisories to be developed on estimating user operating and delay costs will address this issue in greater detail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to increased delay and vehicle operating costs, rehabilitation and maintenance activities may result
in increased accident costs around work zones. Technical advisories will be developed to assist in estimating increases
in accident rates associated with different types of rehabilitation and maintenance activities. The most comprehensive
information on the costs of motor vehicle accidents is contained in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
publication, ``The Economic Cost of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 1990.'' A copy of this document is available in the public
docket for this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proper use of the discount rate has been an issue for LCCA, cost-benefit analysis and other types of economic analysis
as well. Among the issues are the relationship between the discount rate and inflation, factors that affect the choice
of rates, and how to establish rates over a long analysis period. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;94,
``Guidelines and Discount Rate for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' provides guidance on selecting
appropriate discount rates for economic analyses. Since the choice of discount rate can affect relative life-cycle
costs, sensitivity analysis may be appropriate if two or more alternatives are close in cost, if streams of costs and
benefits among alternatives vary significantly over time, or if the discount rate is outside the range of discount
rates recommended by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA will develop training and technical assistance materials to address issues in LCCA. These materials should
supplement guidance on economic analysis techniques contained in AASHTO's 1977 publication, ``A Manual on User

The following is FHWA's LCCA policy for infrastructure investment analyses. It represents good practice that should
be followed by States and local transportation agencies in making program and project investment decisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Life-cycle costs are an important consideration in all highway investment decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The level of detail in LCCA should be commensurate with the level of investment involved and the types of alternatives
being analyzed. Investments on the NHS generally warrant more detailed analysis than investments on non-NHS routes.
Similarly, evaluation of decisions whether to reconstruct or rehabilitate a facility warrants more detailed analysis
than consideration of alternative maintenance strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Typical life-cycle cost analysis profiles may be developed and used as the basis for evaluating alternatives for
general types of improvements, such as, consideration of alternative pavement designs or different types of bridges
on various functional class highways. Major programs and projects, however, often will require consideration of
a broad range of alternative rehabilitation and reconstruction options and more detailed analysis of potential
alternatives. The potential applicability and use of LCCA profiles will be discussed in greater detail in future
technical advisories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Other factors, including budgetary, environmental, and safety considerations, legitimately influence highway
investment decisions and should be considered along with the results of LCCA in evaluating investment alternatives.
Life-cycle cost analysis principles should be used in conjunction with other appropriate economic analysis techniques
in pavement and bridge management systems. Systemwide or network objectives as well as project level concerns should
be considered in decisionmaking, and both levels of analysis should consider life-cycle costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Analysis periods should be for the life of the facility or system of facilities being evaluated and should account
for costs of foreseeable future actions. Analysis periods should not be less than 75 years for major bridge, tunnel,
or hydraulic system investments, and not less than 35 years for pavement investments. Longer design lives may be appropriate
for the NHS or other major routes or corridors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All appropriate agency costs anticipated during the analysis period should be considered in the analysis, including
traffic control costs during maintenance and rehabilitation, costs of special construction procedures required
to maintain traffic, and agency operating costs for such things as tunnel lighting and ventilation. In those cases
where the agency required to operate a facility is not the one making the investment decision, it is important for the
funding agency to include operating costs borne by other organizations responsible for operating the facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. User costs including increased vehicle operating costs, accident costs, and delay-related costs incurred throughout
the analysis period should be considered in LCCA. Increased costs due to deteriorated riding surfaces, circuitous
routings, and accidents and delays around and through maintenance and construction work zones are all important.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Future agency and user costs should be discounted to net present value or converted to equivalent uniform annual
costs using appropriate discount rates. Discount rates selected should be consistent with guidance provided in
OMB Circular A&hyph;94. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical advisories on these and other technical issues in the application of LCCA will be issued by FHWA in the future.

 Under section 1(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, children under age 14 who have unearned income may be taxed on part
of that income at their parent's tax rate. Form 8615 is used to see if any of the child's unearned income is taxed at the
parent's rate and, if so, to figure the child's tax on his or her unearned income and earned income, if any.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total amount available in fiscal year 1994 for grant awards in the research program area of Solar Ultraviolet Radiation
Monitoring is approximately $800,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program, in addition to providing support for research on biological
response to predicted effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, invited applications in 1991 for development of
instrumentation for a solar ultraviolet radiation monitoring network. Based on the results now available from that
earlier activity, the Department desires to support continued development of high quality spectroradiometers
for measurements of ultraviolet-B radiation and utilization of the spectroradiometers in research to accurately
determine ultraviolet-B radiation at ground level. Such information will more accurately document levels of UV
radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Such knowledge is needed in order to develop an understanding of the response
of living systems to current conditions, to forecast future effects, and to develop response strategies for mitigating
effects resulting from any future increases in UV radiation. The following specific program area and guidelines
are provided as a base from which proposals may be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals developed for the Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Monitoring program should include field instrumentation
for high quality spectral irradiance measurements and a research plan for data collection, analysis, and use. Emphasis
should be placed on the following instrumentation specifications and operating protocols:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The instrument should measure the global horizontal terrestrial solar UV&hyph;B spectral irradiance over the spectral
wavelength region from 280&hyph;400 nm. Overall network radiometric uncertainty should be no more than 10% (3 sigma)
at 295 nm decreasing to less than 5% (3 sigma) at 340 nm. These and following specifications are applicable over the
ambient range of temperature, humidity, and pressure found in northern temperate latitudes.

Finally, instrument calibration and characterization with regard to the criteria specified herein, and standardization
among the several instruments, is considered critical. The research plan should give consideration to data collection,
storage, retrieval, processing, and statistical analysis. It is expected that these data will be handled in a manner
appropriate for use by the U.S. and international scientific communities; for support of atmospheric science research;
model development and validation; and documentation of UV&hyph;B climatology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations governing the Rental Certificate and the Rental Voucher Programs are published at 24 CFR parts 882
and 887, respectively. The regulations for allocating housing assistance budget authority under section 213(d)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are published at 24 CFR part 791, subpart D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Allocation Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Housing Needs Formula 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this fiscal year, approximately $975 million of budget authority for the rental voucher and certificate programs
is available for fair share formula allocation. (This amount may be reduced by up to $100 million (or some other amount)
to increase the level of funding for litigation or desegregation.) This funding will support additional units for
HA rental voucher and rental certificate programs. Of this amount, approximately $624 million is for rental vouchers
and approximately $351 million is for rental certificates. This budget authority is being allocated to HUD State
or Area Office and allocation areas under this NOFA, using the housing needs factors established in accordance with
24 CFR 791.402. For purposes of this NOFA, the Department is using the metropolitan area designations that were in
effect prior to December 31, 1992, since detailed census data tabulations for the new metropolitan area designations
are not available, yet. In addition, $51.3 million is retained in a Headquarters Reserve which will not be allocated
by formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Metropolitan/Non-Metropolitan Mix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Separate housing needs factors were developed for the metropolitan and non-metropolitan allocation areas within
each HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction. On a nationwide basis, approximately 90 percent of the Fiscal Year 1994
``fair share'' budget authority for the Rental Voucher Program and Rental Certificate Program is designated for
metropolitan areas. The metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing assistance budget authority
available for use in metropolitan areas and the non-metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing
assistance budget authority available for use in non-metropolitan areas.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The allocation areas were established by the HUD field offices to ensure sufficient competition among HAs (including
State and regional or multi-county HAs) operating housing programs within the HUD-established allocation areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Program Type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the fair share allocation of housing assistance budget authority (See Attachment 1) for the
Rental Voucher Program and for the Rental Certificate Program to each HUD State or Area Office for designated allocation
areas, based on the housing needs factors. The allocation of housing assistance budget authority to each allocation
area, however, is the total for both programs. The allocations have been structured to give HUD State or Area Offices
flexibility in approving HA applications for the rental voucher program or the rental certificate program. It is
not necessary that each allocation area within a HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction be provided both rental vouchers
and rental certificates. This notice also provides, for each allocation area, an estimate of the total number of rental
vouchers and rental certificates that could be funded from the housing assistance available in the allocation area.
These estimates are based on the average fair market rents for two-bedroom units in the HUD State or Area Office's jurisdiction.
The actual number of units assisted will vary from these estimates in the actual bedroom size mix that is funded in a
given area.

(4) Potential Additional Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If additional rental voucher or rental certificate funding becomes available for incremental use during Fiscal
Year 1994, the Department plans to distribute any additional funding to HUD State or Area Offices using the same percentage
distribution as reflected in Attachment 1 to this NOFA. Any additional funding will be used under the competitive
requirements of this NOFA to fund HA applications which were approvable but not funded, or approved and funded at less
than 100 percent of the requested amount.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Selection Criterion 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HA Administrative Capability (40 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Overall HA administrative capability in the Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs
is either excellent or good. Administrative Capability is evidenced by factors such as leasing rates and correct
administration of housing quality standards (HQS), compliance with the portability requirements for rental vouchers
and rental certificates, compliance with Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity program requirements, assistance
payment computation, timely submission of budgets and financial statements, and rent reasonableness requirements.
For purposes of this NOFA, an HA administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation
Program will not be rated on the administration of its Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering
a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program, HUD will rate HA administration of the
Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, Moderate Rehabilitation,
Public Housing or Indian Housing Program, HUD will assess the administrative capability of the HA based on such factors
as experience of staff, support of the HA by the local government, and the HA's administrative experience with non-HUD
housing programs.

(2) Selection Criterion 2: Underfunding of Housing Needs (45 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The degree to which the housing needs of the primary area specified in the HA's application from which the HA draws families
to assist (primary area) have previously been underfunded, relative to the needs of other localities within the same
allocation area, taking into account such factors as the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income
renter households with housing problems, eligible for such assistance. The HUD State or Area Office/Native American
Programs Office will, wherever practicable, consider needs being met by all Federally assisted rental housing programs,
including the FmHA Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program, but will, as a minimum, consider assistance provided
under the Rental Voucher Program, the Rental Certificate Program, other Section 8 Programs, and the Public or Indian
Housing Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Notice PIH 91&hyph;45 (HUD), the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will
notify FmHA of applications it receives and ask that FmHA provide advisory comments concerning the market for additional
assisted housing or the possible impact the proposed units may have on FmHA projects. Applications for which FmHA
has provided comments expressing concerns about market need or the continued stability of existing FmHA projects,
with which HUD agrees, will receive zero points for this criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Rating and Assessment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To receive points under this criterion, an application must propose funding in an area which has been previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underfunded or proportionately funded relative to the need for housing in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same allocation area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assignment of points is based on the degree to which the needs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the primary area specified in the application have been underfunded, taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income renter households with housing
problems. The determination of point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values will be based on a comparison of the percentage of housing need served 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the primary area specified in the application to the percentage of need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served in the allocation area since the 1990 census. The percentages for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation areas and the primary areas are to be rounded to the nearest whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been underfunded and will assign one of the three point-values, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;45 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been severely underfunded. A primary area with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of need served that is equal to or less than one-third the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation area's percentage will be determined to be severely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underfunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;30 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been moderately underfunded. An application with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of need served that is greater than one-third the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area's percentage but equal to or less than two-thirds of the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area percentage will be determined to be moderately underfunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;15 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been proportionately funded. An application with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of need served that is greater than two-thirds the allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area's percentage but equal to or less than the allocation area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage will be determined to be proportionately funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;0 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application has been overfunded. A primary area with a percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need served that is greater than the allocation area percentage will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to have been overfunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Selection Criterion 3: Local Initiatives (5 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application must describe the extent to which HAs demonstrate locally initiated efforts in support of their Rental
Voucher and Rental Certificate Programs or comparable tenant-based rental assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Evaluation of a locality's contribution is measured competitively by the extent to which a locality is
able to provide services or cash contributions or demonstrate its intention to provide this kind of support in the
future, as compared to services or contributions provided by other localities of like program size.

 The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Programs Office will assign one of two point-values, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;5 points: The State or locality provides significant local support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., financial, manpower for inspection services) to its Rental Voucher or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rental Certificate Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;2 points: The State or locality provides minimal local support to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;0 points: The State or locality does not provide support to the HA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program.

D. Local Government Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that HUD independently determine that there is a need for the housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance requested in applications, and solicit and consider comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to this determination from the chief executive officer of the unit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general local government. The HUD State or Area Office/Native American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs Office will obtain Section 213 comments from the unit of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local government in accordance with 24 CFR part 791, subpart C, Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Housing Assistance in Areas Without Housing Assistance Plans. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the unit of general local government must be considered before an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application can be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of expediting the application process, the HA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit a letter with the HA application commenting on the HA application in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Section 213. Since HUD cannot approve an application until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 30-day comment period is closed, the Section 213 letter should not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the application, but also state that HUD may consider the letter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the final comments and that no additional comments will be forthcoming from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the local unit of government.

The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Programs Office may not approve funding for an HA under this NOFA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 25 units, unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The HA requests fewer than 25 units; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The residual budget authority in using the rank order funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process after funding higher ranked applications is insufficient to fund at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 25 units; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The total budget authority available to the allocation area will

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funding Procedure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HUD State or Area Office must develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure for approval of applications (including applications rated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native American Programs Office) for each allocation area in rank order until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the housing assistance budget authority is used. Where a HUD State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area Office funds applications according to rank order for each allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, only to find it has some number of units left, but not enough to fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next fundable application in its entirety or for the minimum of 25 units, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that application can be funded to the extent of the number of units available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve 100 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units requested in all applications that score above a HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum number of units allowed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve less than 100 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the units requested in all applications for each allocation area that score 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above a HUD State or Area Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of units allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If applications are to be funded at less than 100 percent of the units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested in the applications, the HUD State or Area Office must either (i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve the same percentage of the number of units requested in each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application or (ii) divide approvable applications into two or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories, for example, those scoring over 80 points, and those scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 50 and 80 points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the HUD State or Area Office elects to divide applications into two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories, the HUD State or Area Office may choose to approve a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage for applications in each of the two ranking categories so that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher percentage of units requested would be approved for all applications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the higher category and a lower percentage of units requested would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for all applications in the lower category. The HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office must approve the same percentage of each application within each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two ranking categories unless there are insufficient funds to approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum 25 units. If the HUD State or Area Office is unable to fund all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for the minimum funding allowed in either of the two categories, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HUD State or Area Office must reduce the applicable percentage factor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the category in order to fund all applications for the minimum 25 units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(unless the HA requested less than 25 units or the total budget authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the allocation area will fund less than 25 units). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an HA applies for a specific program (i.e., rental vouchers or rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates) and funding for the specified program is not available in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan area or non-metropolitan allocation area, the HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office will award the available form of assistance, even though not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requested by the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HUD State or Area Office must promptly notify the applicable Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Programs Office for each allocation area as to the status of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications from IHAs and, if applicable, the amount of budget authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made available for IHA applications that were rated high enough to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Reallocations of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each HUD State or Area Office must make every reasonable effort to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available funds. It may be necessary, however, to reallocate funds from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one HUD State or Area Office to another when the funds are not likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the HUD State or Area Office to which they were initially assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such cases, the following procedures shall be followed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reallocations Within the Same State. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the allocation of funds to a HUD State or Area Office cannot be awarded within the office jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during Fiscal Year 1994, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD State or Area Office in the same State where they can be used during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fiscal Year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reallocations Between States. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a HUD State or Area Office cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use funds within the same State, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another HUD State or Area Office for use in a State where they can be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during Fiscal Year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reallocations Between Metropolitan and Non-metropolitan Areas. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD State or Area Office must follow the original fund assignments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas when it reallocates unused budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority among allocation areas. If there are not enough approvable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for the designated metropolitan or non-metropolitan budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, the HUD State or Area Office may switch the budget authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area within the same State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that an offsetting switch can be made in another State within the HUD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or Area Office. If an offsetting switch cannot be made and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan or non-metropolitan amounts require changes to the fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assignments, the HUD State or Area Office must obtain the approval of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing, before switching budget authority between a metropolitan and a non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A request for Headquarters approval of a reallocation within or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between States must explain the reasons that funds cannot be used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original State, the amount being withdrawn from the original State, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program type, and the metropolitan/non-metropolitan mix, and the amount to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reallocated. These requests must be submitted to Headquarters (ATTENTION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing) for approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Notification of Funds Awarded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) After the HUD State or Area Offices have reviewed, rated, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranked applications, and the HUD State or Area Offices and Native American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs Offices have approved the applications, each HUD State or Area Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and each Native American Programs Office must submit to Headquarters a list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all approved applications. The application approval list is due in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headquarters (ATTENTION: Rental Assistance Division, Office of Public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indian Housing) on the tenth working day following the date set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headquarters for completion of application ranking and selections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Offices must provide the following information for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application approved: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The name and address of the HA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The project number, and the number of rental vouchers and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of rental certificates, as applicable, approved for the HA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The amount of contract authority and budget authority, stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately for rental vouchers and rental certificates.

I. Headquarters Reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department is retaining in a Headquarters Reserve approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$51.3 million of the $1.0 billion of budget authority available for allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by formula for rental vouchers and rental certificates. Funds in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headquarters Reserve will not be allocated by formula because these funds will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in connection with natural disasters, litigation, desegregation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other housing emergencies, consistent with 24 CFR 791.407. Headquarters will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify HAs when they are eligible to receive assistance from the Headquarters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reserve and may invite the HAs to submit applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
J. Other Allocations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In addition to the budget authority for ``fair share'' rental vouchers and rental certificates, additional budget
authority (including carryover budget authority) is available for allocation in Fiscal Year 1994 for rental vouchers
and rental certificates for the following purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Relocation, Demolition and Disposition (HOPE I, II, Section 5(h), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 and Urban Revitalization) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Headquarters will allocate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices to assist families living in public housing
projects that are being demolished or disposed with HUD approval; to provide replacement housing in connection with
Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I or Section 5(h) activities; or relocation assistance to families affected
by HOPE I, HOPE II, and Section 5(h) activities; or assistance to non-purchasing families affected by HOPE II activities.
HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office requests for funding under this category will be approved
on a first-come, first-served basis after notification by HUD that an application for public housing demolition
or disposition, Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I, HOPE II, or Section 5(h) was approved. HUD State or Area
Office/Native American Programs Office requests should include all data pertinent to determining the eligibility
of the request for funding under the appropriate program and the amount of funds required. Replacement housing assistance
will be provided in the form of 5-year rental voucher or rental certificate funding. (Approximately 2,988 units and
$99.852 million in budget authority.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Headquarters will allocate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices/Native American Programs Offices for
the renewal of rental voucher and rental certificate funding increments expiring in Fiscal Year 1994. Renewal funding
will be provided in-kind (i.e., rental voucher funding for expiring rental voucher increments, and rental certificate
funding for expiring rental certificate increments). (Approximately 177,000 units and $4.7 billion in budget authority.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Headquarters will allocate rental certificate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices for tenant-based rental
assistance to residents of Section 23 leased housing for which leases are expiring. HUD State or Area Office requests
for funding under this category will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis. HUD State or Area Offices must
include all data necessary to determine the amount of funds required. (Approximately 374 units and $7.4 million in
budget authority.)

(4) Section 8 Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Headquarters will allocate Rental Certificate Program cost amendments to provide budget authority increases to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA rental certificate programs. Headquarters will allocate the funds on an as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed basis. (Approximately $289.6 million in budget authority.)

(5) HA Portability Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Headquarters will allocate these funds to pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special preliminary fees to HAs under Rental Voucher and Rental Certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program portability provisions. The Department issued a HUD Notice PIH 92&hyph;14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(PHA), dated April 22, 1992, that describes administrative procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting the special preliminary fees. These funds will be allocated to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs on a first-come, first-served basis. (Approximately $6 million in budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Applications must be submitted to the local HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office/Native American Programs Office on Form HUD&hyph;52515 in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The application should include a narrative description of how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application meets, or will meet, the application selection criteria. Failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit a narrative description is not cause for application rejection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office can only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and rank the application based on information the Office has on-hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Attachment 1 at the end of this notice lists the HUD State or Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Offices and the number of units and budget authority available for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation area. HAs should limit their applications for the ``fair share'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to a reasonable number of rental vouchers and rental certificates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the capacity of the HA to lease all the units within 12 months of ACC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
execution. The number of units on the HA application may not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater of: (a) Ten percent (10%) of the total rental vouchers and rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates under reservation for the HA; or (b) 50 units.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(4) HAs shall submit only one application (Form HUD&hyph;52515) for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation area. If both rental vouchers and rental certificates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested on the same application, then the application will be given two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project numbers, one for the Rental Voucher Program and one for the Rental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate Program. The total number of units applied for may not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ten percent or 50-unit limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Regional and State-wide HAs may submit one application for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation area, and each application will be considered separately. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional or State-wide HA application may request up to ten percent (10%) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total rental vouchers and rental certificates the HA has under reservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each allocation area as applicable, or 50 units, whichever is greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the number of units requested in any application that exceeds the ten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent or 50-unit limit to the greater of ten percent (10%) of the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of rental vouchers and rental certificates identified on the latest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD-approved budget for the HA.

D. Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires grantees of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to certify that they will provide a drug-free workplace. Thus, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA must certify (even though it has done so previously) that it will comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the drug-free workplace requirements in accordance with 24 CFR part 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
E. Certification Regarding Lobbying

Section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, Public Law 101&hyph;121, approved October 23,
1989, (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the Byrd Amendment) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's regulations on these restrictions on lobbying are codified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 CFR part 87. To comply with 24 CFR 87.110, any HA (other than an IHA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the definition of ``person'' in 24 CFR 87.105) submitting an application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this NOFA for more than $100,000 of budget authority assistance must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a certification and, if warranted, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist HAs, the texts for the Certification Regarding Lobbying and Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form LLL, Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying are available from the HUD State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Area Office.

The application meets HUD's regulations regarding anti-lobbying set out at 24 CFR 87. The anti-lobbying requirements
apply to applications that, if approved, would result in the HA obtaining more than $100,000 in budget authority.
The Department has determined that IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of their sovereign
power are excluded from coverage, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from coverage. To comply,
HAs must submit an Anti-lobbying Certification and, if warranted, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.

IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
To be eligible for processing, an application must be received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the date and time specified in Section II of this NOFA. The HUD State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area Office/Native American Programs Office will initially screen all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications and notify HAs of technical deficiencies by letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an application has technical deficiencies, the HA will have 14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days from the date of the issuance of written notification to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the missing or corrected information to the HUD State or Area Office and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Native American Programs Office. Curable technical deficiencies relate only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to items that do not improve the substantive quality of the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the rating factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All HAs must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any such deficiency. Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received after 3 p.m. local time (i.e., the time in the appropriate HUD State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Area Office/Native American Programs Office), of the fourteenth calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejected as incomplete. All HAs are encouraged to review the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening checklist provided in Section III of this notice. The checklist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies all technical requirements needed for application processing. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HA application that does not comply with the requirements of 24 CFR 882.204(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 887.55(b) and this notice, including the drug-free workplace certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the anti-lobbying certification/disclosure requirements, after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the 14-day cure period will be rejected from processing.

V. Other Matters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been made in accordance with the Department's regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding is available for public inspection between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20410. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
B. Federalism Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on states or their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review under the Order. This notice is a funding notice and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially alter the established roles of the Department, the States, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local governments, including HAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
C. Impact on the Family
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that this notice does not have potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the meaning of the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Order. This is a funding notice and does not alter program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements concerning family eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Section 102 of the HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will ensure that documentation and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (Reform Act) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088), and became effective on June 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of funding decisions are restrained by part 4 from providing advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department, should contact his or her HUD State or Area Office Counsel, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Branches of the Federal Government in connection with specific contract, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in connection with the assistance. IHAs established by an Indian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not excluded from the statute's coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Section 112 of the Reform Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b). Section 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the receipt of assistance.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is publishing a consolidated listing of its institutions. The following institutions
have been added to the listing: Federal Correctional Institutions at Cumberland, Maryland; Greenville, Illinois;
and Pekin, Illinois; a Federal Medical Center at Carswell, Texas; and a Federal Transportation Center at Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma. The former Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Worth, Texas has been redesignated as a Federal
Medical Center. The Federal Prison Camp at Tyndall Air Force Base and the Federal Medical Center at Carville, Louisiana
have been closed and consequently have been removed from the listing. Finally, the names of certain Bureau institutions
located on military reservations have been shortened for the sake of consistency and ease of reference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Interagency Coordinating Council (FICC) is established under section 685 of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1484a). The Council is established to: (1) minimize duplication across Federal,
State and local agencies of programs and activities relating to early intervention services for infants and toddlers
with disabilities and their families and preschool services for children with disabilities; (2) ensure effective
coordination of Federal early intervention and preschool programs, including Federal technical assistance and
support activities; and (3) identify gaps in Federal agency programs and services and barriers to Federal interagency
cooperation. To meet these purposes, the FICC seeks to: (1) identify areas of conflict, overlap, and omissions in
interagency policies related to the provision of services to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities;
(2) develop and implement joint policy interpretations on issues related to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers
that cut across Federal agencies, including modifications or regulations to eliminate barriers to interagency
programs and activities; and (3) coordinate the provision of technical assistance and dissemination of best practice
information. The FICC is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.
