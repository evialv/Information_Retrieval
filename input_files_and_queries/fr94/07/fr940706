This action has also been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612).
William E. Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Only State and local welfare agencies will be affected
to the extent that they are involved with appeals of Food Stamp Program quality control claims. The procedures to appeal
quality control claims are being changed by this rule to streamline and reduce the time and resources State and local
welfare agencies previously devoted to such appeals. Potential and current participants in the Food Stamp Program
will not be affected.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 19, 1993, the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 58 FR 5188 to implement section
603 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (HPA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435). The HPA amended the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as
amended (the Act) (7 U.S.C. 2011&hyph;2032) regarding the Food Stamp Program's administrative review process for
QC claims (7 U.S.C. 2023(a)). A total of eight comment letters were received on the proposed rule. One commenter subsequently
advised the Department that it considered its comment letter to be inappropriate to the subject of the NPRM and withdrew
its letter. The following analysis is based on the remaining seven comment letters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the proposed regulations on January 19, 1993, Congress has enacted Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66 (Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act) (Leland Act)
to further streamline the appeals process for QC claims established under section 16(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2025(c).
Section 13951 of the Leland Act amended sections 13(a)(1), 14(a) and 16(c) of the Act to: (1) Provide that State agencies
will be assessed interest on outstanding QC liabilities if the administrative appeals process takes more than one
year to resolve these claims; (2) to establish timeframes for the administrative review process and (3) to provide
that an administrative law judge (ALJ) shall consider a State agency's contention of good cause when considering
whether to waive all or part of a State agency's QC liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full explanation of the rationale of the proposed rule is contained in its preamble. It is suggested that interested
parties refer to that preamble for additional background information (58 FR 5188). Following is a detailed discussion
on the comments received on the proposed rule, non-discretionary revisions based on the Leland Act and the provisions
of the final rule. The Department has determined that, with respect to the revisions based upon non-discretionary
provisions of the Leland Act referenced above, notice and comment are unnecessary since the Department has no discretion
with respect to these provisions. accordingly, such revisions have been made through this final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Time: In &sect;283.4(a) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a State agency must file a notice of appeal within
10 days of receipt by certified mail or personal service of the bill for collection from FNS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received three comments on this provision. One commenter stated that the 10-day time span to file the
written notice of appeal was too short and that a 30-day period would be more reasonable. Two commenters indicated
that it was unclear whether the notice of appeal or the bill for collection must be served by certified mail or personal
service. These commenters questioned if it was FNS' intent to require that the notice of appeal be filed by certified
mail or personal service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered the comment urging extension of the 10-day requirement but cannot adopt this suggestion.
Section 13951 of the Leland Act retained the 10-day filing requirement for the notice of appeal but provides that the
filing deadline shall be extended by the ALJ for cause shown. The Department believes that the requirements for the
content of the notice of appeal are minimal and should not pose any undue difficulty for the State agency to meet the
10-day filing deadline. If an extension is requested, the request and cause for such request must be submitted to the
ALJ or chief judge prior to the expiration of the 10-day filing deadline. The Department has also revised &sect;283.22(f)
to incorporate this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also notes that section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act authorizes the ALJ to extend the deadlines for
filing of the appeal petition, answer, rebuttal and initial decision for cause shown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the service of the notice of appeal and has revised this section
to clarify that it is not FNS' intention to require the State agency to file the notice of appeal by certified mail or
personal service. As discussed in the preamble to the NPRM, the State agency will have 10 days from receipt of the bill
for collection to file a notice of appeal with the Hearing Clerk. Section 283.22(b) of the NPRM provides that the notice
of appeal is considered to be filed on the date that it is postmarked or, if hand delivered, the date it is received by
the Hearing Clerk. FNS will continue its policy of issuing the bill for collection either by certified mail or personal
service. Once the State agency receives the bill for collection, it will have 10 calendar days to file its notice of
appeal, unless an extension is requested prior to the expiration of the 10-day filing deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhaustion of Administrative remedies: The Department has added new &sect;&sect;283.4(b) and 283.25(b) to clarify
that the State agency must appeal the bill for collection to the ALJ in order to exhaust available administrative remedies
as a prerequisite to seeking judicial review. While the Department believes it is clear that Congress intended section
14(a) of the Act to require the State agency to exhaust an administrative appeal before the ALJ before seeking judicial
review, the rule has been clarified to specifically require such exhaustion. Thus, the decision of the ALJ is final
for purposes of judicial review. However, as discussed in the preamble regarding &sect;283.17(c)(3), either party
to the appeal may, at its option, seek reconsideration of ALJ decision or review by the Judicial Officer. Accordingly,
&sect;&sect;283.4 (b)&hyph;(c) of the NPRM have been renumbered as &sect;&sect;283.4 (c)&hyph;(d) and &sect;&sect;283.25
(b)&hyph;(h) of the NPRM have been renumbered &sect;&sect;283.25 (c)&hyph;(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Content of the notice: In &sect;283.4(c) of the NPRM, the Department proposed the information which an acceptable
notice of appeal must contain and that failure to file an acceptable notice of appeal would result in a dismissal of
the notice by the ALJ and a waiver of the opportunity for further review unless the State agency pursues reconsideration
by the ALJ or review by the Judicial Officer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that there were no provisions for
a State to remedy a technical defect or omission in a notice of appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered the comment concerning the technical defect or omission from the notice of appeal,
and has determined that adoption of this suggestion is unnecessary since the NPRM contains provisions for a State
to remedy a technical defect or omission in a notice of appeal. As discussed in &sect;283.4(c)(2) of the NPRM, if the
ALJ dismisses the notice of appeal because the State agency fails to file an adequate notice, the State agency may remedy
the defect and either request reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Judicial Officer in accordance with &sect;&sect;283.17(d)
and 283.20 of the NPRM. These provisions would not apply for failure to file a timely notice of appeal or request for
extensions of time to file. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.4(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good Cause: In &sect;283.4(d) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the Secretary's determination concerning
good cause be final and not subject to an appeal to the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter objected to the fact that FNS' good cause determinations
will not be subject to the appeal process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act deleted the provision of section 603 of the HPA which provided that the Secretary
retained the authority to waive some or all of a State's QC claim where the Secretary determined that the State agency
had good cause for failure to meet its error rate goal and that the decision of the Secretary was not subject to review
by the ALJ. The Leland Act requires that the ALJ, in considering a State agency's appeal of QC liability consider all
grounds for denying the claim, in whole or in part, including the contention of a State agency that the claim should
be waived, in whole or in part, for good cause. The Department intends to publish a proposed rulemaking addressing
the good cause criteria, as defined in the Leland Act. The regulation will be used by the Secretary and/or the Secretary's
designee to assess, evaluate and respond to claims by the State for a good cause waiver of liability in conjunction
with the appeals process. The Department has deleted &sect;283.4(d) of the NPRM. Additionally, &sect;283.5(a)
of the NPRM has been amended to reflect Leland Act changes to good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Receipt of notice of appeal and assignment of docket number: In &sect;283.4(e)(iii) of the NPRM, the Department proposed
that the Hearing Clerk would acknowledge timely receipt of the notice of appeal and advise the State agency that the
appeal petition must be filed within 30 days of service of the Hearing Clerk's letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that the 30-day deadline for filing
the appeal petition is too burdensome for States and that a 60-day deadline would be more appropriate. The commenter
believed that the extended time period would enable States to obtain necessary legal support and to better develop
appropriate arguments in support of the appeal petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has revised the deadline for filing the appeal petition from 30 days to 60 days. Section 13951(c)(4)
of the Leland Act requires that the State agency submit evidence in support of the appeal not later than 60 days after
receiving a notice of the claim and provides that the ALJ shall extend the 60-day deadline for cause shown. As previously
discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of this final rule requires the State agency to file a written request for the extension
prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of cause for the extension. This provision is in keeping with
the legislative intent of the HPA that the appeals process be streamlined and the appeal procedures be as expeditious
as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stay of Collection: In &sect;283.4(f) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a timely notice of appeal would automatically
stay collection action on the QC claim. However, interest would continue to accrue on the outstanding claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that since the NPRM would allow the Department
to seek review by the Judicial Officer, the final determination of the ALJ may be delayed beyond the two year period
during which interest on a QC claim would not accrue. The commenter suggested that in order to avoid the imposition
of interest due to a delay that the State agency did not seek, the accrual of interest should be tolled (suspended) during
the review by the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has considered this comment but cannot adopt this suggestion. Section 13951(a)(2) of the Leland Act
provides that interest on the unpaid claim would accrue either from a date that is one year after the date the bill is
received or the date of the decision on the administrative appeal, whichever is earlier. The Leland Act does not allow
a suspension of interest beyond the one-year period, regardless of the reason for the delay in a final administrative
decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Content of the Appeal Petition: In &sect;283.4(g)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the State agency must
request an oral hearing and that failure to request that hearing would result in the forfeiture of the opportunity
for an oral hearing. The QC claim would then be decided using the procedures established under subpart C.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter suggested that rather than making an oral hearing
an option for the State agency, the Department should make this a standard element in the process which the State must
request be omitted if the State wishes an appeal to be decided without oral hearing. The commenter argued that this
change would avoid any misunderstanding on the part of the State agency or the Department as to whether the State intended
to request an oral hearing.

The Department has considered this comment and has decided not to adopt the suggestion. Section 603 of the HPA provides
that determinations regarding a QC claim shall be made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing. In
addition, section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that, on the request of the Secretary or the State agency,
the ALJ shall hold an evidentiary hearing. The Department is retaining the provisions of the NPRM which require that
the State agency notify the Hearing Clerk in its appeal petition if the State agency desires an oral hearing. The Department
wishes to emphasize that a State agency that waives an oral hearing would not generally be permitted to later request
that an oral hearing be conducted. The Department will amend &sect;283.4(g)(3) to cross-reference &sect;283.15(a)
to clarify those circumstances under which it would be possible for a State agency to receive an oral hearing if it had
not initially requested the oral hearing in its appeal petition. In addition, the Department has added &sect;283.4(i)
to provide that if no hearing had been requested, the appeal would proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth
under subpart C (Summary Procedure for Appeals of QC Claims of Less than $50,000). In the event that the appeal is pursued
under subpart C, procedures exist under &sect;283.26(a) to provide the State agency with an opportunity to request
an oral hearing if the State agency does not believe that the summary procedure is adequate for handling the appeal
and that an oral hearing is necessary.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment recommending that FNS be given 60 days in which to file an answer to the State agency's
appeal petition. The commenter also agreed with the provision that failure to file a timely answer would be considered,
for purposes of the appeal, an admission of the State agency's allegations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has revised the deadline for FNS to file an answer to the State agency's appeal petition from 30 days
to 60 days. Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that not later than 60 days after a State agency submits evidence
in support of the appeal, the Secretary shall submit responsive evidence to the ALJ and provides that the ALJ shall
extend the 60-day deadline for cause shown. As previously discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of the final rule requires
the Secretary to file a written request for the extension prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of cause
for the request.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that the preamble and the regulations
do not contain a timeline in which the motion for a hearing is to be filed. The commenter suggested that it would be difficult
to conclude that both parties would be knowledgeable if a motion for a hearing was filed with the appeal petition or
the answer to the appeal petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is revising this provision to incorporate section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act which requires the
State agency to submit rebuttal evidence to the ALJ, to the extent such evidence exists, not later than 30 days after
the Secretary submits responsive evidence. The Department is retaining the provision in the NPRM which allows either
party to amend the appeal or answer at any time prior to the other party filing a motion for a hearing. An amendment following
such a motion would require approval by the ALJ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wishes to clarify that the motion for a hearing would not be filed with the appeal or the answer to the
appeal. Rather, as discussed in &sect;283.15(b), a motion for a hearing is filed by either party after the completion
of all scheduled prehearing actions (such as discovery) that were agreed upon during the prehearing conference,
scheduling conference or as otherwise established by the ALJ. The filing of a motion for a hearing advises the ALJ and
the other parties to the appeal that the party has completed all prehearing activities and is ready to proceed with
the hearing. Because the timing for the filing of the motion for a hearing is dependent upon the completion of all previously
agreed upon prehearing activities, it is not possible to provide an absolute timeline as to when a motion for a hearing
would be filed.

Section 283.10: Consent Decision

This section of the NPRM contains the provision allowing the parties to the appeal to mutually agree to end the appeal

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter suggested that this section be modified to state
clearly that the parties may enter into a stipulation as to facts and that this would not preclude further review of
the legal issues. The commenter was concerned that legal issues would not be considered if the underlying basis for
the legal issues were facts which were not in dispute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has decided not to adopt it since the concerns of the commenter are addressed
in &sect;283.11, the pre-hearing conference (and similarly in &sect;283.29_scheduling conference). As provided
for in &sect;283.11(c), one purpose of the ALJ conducting a prehearing conference is to allow the parties to consider
the possibility of obtaining stipulations as to facts in order to expedite and aid in the disposition of the appeal.
The Department wishes to clarify that the purpose of the consent decree is to allow the parties to mutually agree to
conclude the appeal process prior to the ALJ issuing an initial decision on the merits of the appeal. It is similar to
settlement of a civil action in court. The consent decree is not subject to further review by the Judicial Officer or
the Federal court. The appeals process contains prehearing procedures to allow the parties to enter into a stipulation
as to facts which would not preclude further review of the legal issues. Furthermore, the Department believes that
stipulations as to facts may be appropriate at any point to further expedite the appeal.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this proposal. The commenter noted that given the multiplicity of issues to
be addressed at the prehearing conference, any party should be entitled to obtain a stenographic transcript of a prehearing
conference at its own expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.11(d) to clarify that any party may petition
the ALJ to allow for a stenographic transcript of a prehearing conference at the petitioner's own expense. A copy of
the prehearing transcript must be made available to the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal at no cost to the other
parties. In response to this comment, the Department has also revised &sect;283.15(o) to clarify that the cost of
preparing the hearing transcript and providing one copy of the transcript to the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal
shall be borne by the party requesting the hearing. The Department further notes that where these costs are incurred
by the State, such costs are eligible for reimbursement in accordance with part 277 of the Food Stamp Program regulations.

Depositions: In &sect;283.12(a) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the ALJ could order the taking of depositions
in order to elicit testimony which otherwise might not be available at the time of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received five comments on this provision. All of the commenters objected to restricting the use of
depositions to those instances in which testimony might not otherwise be available. One commenter argued that the
States' right to due process at the administrative appeal level was in jeopardy. Another commenter noted that by categorically
prohibiting the use of depositions other than to preserve testimony, FNS has seriously compromised the States' ability
to challenge error-rate penalty claims. This commenter also argued that by preventing the ALJ from using discovery
depositions as one tool of litigation management, FNS has compromised the ALJ's ability to preside over the taking
of evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered these comments but has not adopted them. It is the Department's position that the use
of depositions should be restricted to those instances in which the witness may be unavailable to testify at the hearing.
The Department believes that the discovery procedures provided in the NPRM for interrogatories, admissions, request
for production of documents, and depositions, as well as the prehearing conference, provide adequate discovery
tools for the parties to prepare for the oral hearing or to submit cross motions for summary judgment pursuant to &sect;283.30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department believes that permitting discovery depositions would result in substantial costs and
delay in the appeals process. The Department recognizes that a significant goal of the amendments to the Act by section
603 of the HPA was to create a more efficient appeals process. The House Report states that an objective of section 603
of the HPA was to ``streamline[] the appeals process of the quality control system.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''
H.R. Rep. No. 828, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1988). Further, Representative Panetta stated during debate of the HPA,
``(a) third set of changes aims to speed the resolution of financial claims against State agencies for excessive error
by streamlining the appeals process and providing for the payment of interest.'' 134 Cong. Rec. 20,982 (1988). Representative
Emerson reiterated this same intention. 134 Cong. Rec. 20,984 (1988). The Department believes that restricting
the use of depositions to those instances in which the witness may be unavailable to testify at the hearing is in keeping
with the stated intent of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interrogatories and Admissions: In &sect;&sect;283.12(b) (1) and (2) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that
the parties be limited to fifteen interrogatories and admissions, including subparts, unless additional questions
were authorized by the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received five comments on these provisions. All of the commenters objected to limiting the number
of interrogatories and admissions. One commenter noted that given the ALJ's authority to limit discovery, it would
be more efficient not to impose an arbitrary limit on the number of interrogatories and admissions. The commenter
argued that the responding party could request a protective order from the ALJ if it felt that the requests were burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered these comments and has revised &sect;&sect;283.12(b) (1) and (2) to permit twenty-five
interrogatories and admissions, including subparts, unless additional questions are authorized by the ALJ. The
Department continues to believe that a limit on the number of interrogatories and admissions available without approval
by the ALJ is reasonable given the authority of the ALJ to authorize an increase in that number. The Department disagrees
that it should be the responsibility of the responding party to pursue a protective order if the scope of the discovery
is burdensome. Rather, it is reasonable to place the responsibility on the requesting party to justify why the ALJ
should authorize an increase in the number of interrogatories and admissions. This limit is also consistent with
congressional intent to streamline the appeals process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production of Documents: In &sect;283.12(b)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that any party to the appeal
may serve a request for the production of documents that are in the possession or control of another party. The Department
also proposed that the requested documents would be provided upon payment of fees for search and duplication of the
documents.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. One commenter noted that while the preamble to the NPRM contained
a provision requiring that the requested documents be relevant to the issues under appeal, the regulatory language
did not contain that requirement. The commenter suggested that the Department adopt the standard set forth in the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The second commenter opposed the assessment of fees for the production of documents.
The commenter noted that since only governmental agencies are participating in the review of the QC claim, the Department
ought to forgo the assessment of fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered the comment concerning the issue of the relevancy of the documents and has decided to
revise &sect;283.12(b)(3) to be consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the assessment of fees for the production of documents and has
decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that it is consistent and equitable that the costs of the search and
duplication of documents under a request for production be borne by the party making the request. State agencies may
submit such costs for reimbursement under 7 CFR part 277.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postponements or delays: In &sect;283.12(b)(4) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the hearing or other proceedings
of the appeal process would not be postponed or delayed pending a response to or resolution of issues pertaining to
a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter strongly disagreed with the proposal that no
delays or postponements of the QC appeal occur pending receipt of documents requested under FOIA. The commenter argued
that documents requested under FOIA may be crucial to the resolution of the appeal and suggested that either a timeline
should be imposed for furnishing documents requested under the FOIA or delays/postponements should be accepted
as part of the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. The Department has established procedures
for the production of documents which would negate the need for a party to the appeal to pursue document production
under the provisions of FOIA. As provided for in &sect;283.12(b)(3) of the NPRM, the parties to the appeal are afforded
the opportunity under the discovery process to request all documents relevant to the issues under appeal or which
would reasonably lead to the discovery of such documents. In addition, the ALJ will establish the deadline by which
all discovery activities must be completed. While the Department must process the FOIA and provide all responsive
nonprivileged documents, it is inappropriate to delay or postpone the QC appeal pending action on the FOIA request.
This also furthers congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. This section has been renumbered in the
final rulemaking as &sect;283.12(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Witnesses and Exhibits: In &sect;283.12(b)(9)(ii) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a witness whose name
did not appear on the list of witnesses would not be permitted to testify at the hearing. In addition, exhibits which
were not provided to the opposing party 15 days prior to the hearing would not be admitted into evidence at the hearing
absent a showing of cause.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. The commenters argued that there may be situations where
a witness identified on an exchanged list is unavailable to testify at the hearing. However, the party may have a substitute
witness not identified on the exchanged list who is available to testify. The party should be permitted to amend the
list upon a showing of cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that there are circumstances where it is unnecessary to exchange documents during the prehearing
process because those documents are already in the possession of each party through their normal course of business.
The commenter argued that under this circumstance the regulation should require that the parties need only identify
documents in the possession of the opposing party and notice an intention to introduce them at the hearing.

 The Department has considered the comment concerning witnesses and has revised the regulations to clarify that it
is the intent of the Department that in those situations where a party shows cause as to the reason a witness's name did
not appear on the witness list, upon motion and approval by the ALJ, that witness will be permitted to testify at the
hearing. The Department also wishes to clarify that if this situation arises, the other parties to the appeal may request
a delay in the hearing to allow for an opportunity to prepare for this previously unidentified witness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the exchange of documents and has determined that adoption
of this suggestion is unnecessary since &sect;283.11(a)(3) of the NPRM provides the parties with the option of either
furnishing copies or a list of documents that the party anticipates relying upon at the hearing. Since exhibits are
not necessarily previously existing documents which are in the possession of the other party, the Department is retaining
the provision concerning the exchange of exhibits. This section of the NPRM has been moved in the final rulemaking
to &sect;283.15(d).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment concerning the organization of this section. The commenter suggested that since
&sect;&sect;283.12(b)(6) (Inclusion in the record) and (9) (Exchange of witness and rebuttal witness lists, statements
and exhibits) relate to the hearing procedures, these two subsections should be moved to &sect;283.15.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has adopted this suggestion. The Department has made the following
changes from the NPRM: &sect;283.12(b)(9) has been moved and renumbered as &sect;283.15(d) and &sect;283.15(b)(6)
has been moved and renumbered as &sect;283.15(i). The remaining sections of 283.15 have been renumbered, as necessary.

 In &sect;283.15(b) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the ALJ shall schedule a hearing upon receipt of a motion
by any party setting forth the issue and stating that the matter is ready for a hearing.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that this provision could be interpreted
as allowing the ALJ to deny a party's request for a hearing. The commenter suggested that this section be revised to
clarify that this section pertains only to the scheduling of a hearing. The commenter also noted that this section
suggests that a hearing is permitted only if material facts are disputed and suggested that this section should be
revised to permit the ALJ to hear oral arguments on legal issues even if there are no material facts in dispute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that the ALJ decide the appeal within 60 days after receipt of rebuttal
evidence by the State agency, or, if no rebuttal evidence is submitted, within 90 days after the State submits the notice
of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal. Given these statutory deadlines, the ALJ shall establish at the prehearing
conference the dates by which the parties must complete prehearing activities. The parties would, following completion
of such activities, file a motion stating that they are ready for hearing. The Leland Act authorizes the ALJ to extend
certain statutory deadlines for cause shown. The Department anticipates that the ALJ may extend procedural deadlines
for cause shown to accommodate the completion of prehearing and posthearing activities as is shown to be necessary.
As previously discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of the final rule requires the parties to file a written request for an extension
prior to the due date with a showing of cause for the extension requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the motion for a hearing and has determined that a revision to
this provision is unnecessary, other than to eliminate the requirement to set forth the issues within the motion.
The Department believes that the issues will be adequately framed by the prehearing procedures. Upon filing for a
motion for hearing, an oral hearing will be scheduled within the statutory time frames provided by the Leland Act,
unless an extension has been requested and granted by the ALJ or the ALJ has extended the time frames 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

sua sponte.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the ALJ conducting an oral hearing on the legal issues when there
are no material facts in dispute. The Department has not adopted this suggestion. The Department wishes to clarify
that the purpose of the oral hearing is to present the facts which are in dispute. If it is determined or agreed at prehearing
or otherwise that there are no material facts in dispute, then the appropriate course of action would be to pursue resolution
of the remaining legal issues utilizing the procedures established under subpart C_Summary Procedure for Appeals
of QC Claims of Less than $50,000. These legal issues should be the basis for cross motions for summary judgment. In
view of the comment received, the Department has revised &sect;283.31(d) to allow the ALJ to request oral argument,
if necessary, in those instances when a stipulation of all material facts has been entered by the parties to the appeal.

Time and Place:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In &sect;283.15(b) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the hearing before the ALJ shall be held at the Department
of Agriculture, Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. Both commenters objected to the hearings being held exclusively
in Washington, DC and suggested that the ALJ should determine the location of the hearing taking into account the convenience
of the parties and their witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.15(b) to permit the ALJ to hold the hearing at
a location more convenient to the parties and their witnesses upon a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances.
The Department has determined that budgetary constraints will not be considered an unusual or extraordinary circumstance
since these costs are eligible for reimbursement, in part, in accordance with part 277 of the Food Stamp Program regulations.
The Department believes that requiring a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances takes into consideration
such burdens of the parties while also preserving the efficiency of the appeals process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Order of appearance: In &sect;283.15(f) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that FNS would have the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence, the QC claim against the State and that the State agency would have the burden of
proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts upon which it bases its appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter argued that contrary to the intent of Congress,
the proposed rule shifted the burden of proof to the States. The commenter suggested that this section be modified
to require that FNS, and not the States, bear the burden of proving its error-rate penalty claim against the State.
This burden of proof would be required for all factual matters put in issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has determined that a revision to this provision is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, however, wishes to reiterate that it has the ultimate burden of persuasion, by a preponderance of
the evidence, of the QC error rate claim against the State throughout the appeals process. Nothing in the NPRM or this
final rule changes that burden. However, if the Department makes a prima facia case, the burden of going forward with
the evidence upon which the State bases its appeal shifts to the State agency. The State must prove any evidence offered
to meet this burden of going forward by a preponderance. It is well settled that a fact can never be proven by something
less than a preponderance of the evidence. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.15(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objections: In &sect;283.15(h) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that at the hearing any party may object to a ruling
by the ALJ and that any objection not made to the ALJ could not be raised if there were a subsequent review by the Judicial
Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that there appeared to be some confusion
of intent between the preamble and the regulatory language. The commenter questioned if it was the intent of the Department
to limit materials presented to the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that the review by the Judicial Officer shall be based
on decisions rendered by the ALJ. The ALJ must have been provided the opportunity to render a decision on an issue before
that issue can be appealed to the Judicial Officer. If a party to the appeal fails to raise an objection to the ALJ, that
objection cannot be raised with the Judicial Officer since the ALJ had not rendered a decision on that objection. This
section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.15(j).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official Records or documents: In &sect;283.15(j) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that official government
records or documents could be admitted into evidence without the production of the person who prepared the document.
The party could either submit the officially published document or a certified copy of the document. The Department's
Office of General Counsel would prepare the certification for FNS and other Departmental records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that this procedure was too cumbersome
since it apparently would require that States go to the USDA General Counsel to certify each and every FNS document,
including policy statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that State agencies would only be required to request
that the USDA General Counsel certify FNS documents if such documents are not officially published documents. The
Department also wishes to clarify that official records or documents may include official State government records
or documents. In similar fashion, for unpublished State documents, any necessary certification would be provided
by State personnel having the legal authority to make such certification. This section has been renumbered in the
final rulemaking as &sect;283.15(l).

Section 283.17: Post-Hearing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which will be followed at the completion of the hearing before the
ALJ. This section includes the requirements for post-hearing submissions by the parties to the appeal as well as the
issuance of the ALJ decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ALJ's initial decision: In &sect;283.17(c)(1) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the ALJ would issue a decision
on the appeal within a reasonable period of time after the termination of the time allowed for filing of proposed findings
of fact, conclusions of law, orders, and any briefs in support thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that the ALJ decide the appeal within 60 days after receipt of rebuttal
evidence by the State agency, or, if no rebuttal evidence is submitted, within 90 days after the State submits the notice
of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal. The Department has revised &sect;&sect;283.17(c)(1) and 283.32(a)
to incorporate this legislative provision. As previously discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of the final rule requires
the State agency to file a written request for the extension prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of
cause for the extension.

ALJ's Initial decision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In &sect;283.17(c)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that no decision would be final for purposes of judicial
review except a final decision of the Judicial Officer upon appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that if the decision of the ALJ is adverse
to the State agency, judicial review by the Federal court should not be precluded because the State agency did not seek
review by the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised the final rule to provide that the initial decision of the
ALJ is considered final for purposes of judicial review. However, this would not preclude FNS, or any other party to
the appeal, from seeking either reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motion for Reconsideration: In &sect;283.17(d)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a response to the motion
for reconsideration would be allowed only upon the request of the ALJ.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. The commenters argued that a response to a motion for reconsideration
should be the standard procedure rather than at the discretion of the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.17(d)(3) to provide that the other parties
to the appeal shall respond within 10 days of receipt of the brief or written materials filed by the party requesting
reconsideration unless an extension has been requested and granted by the ALJ or the ALJ has extended the time frame

Motion for Reconsideration: In &sect;283.17(d)(4) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the parties to the appeal
could not pursue a motion for reconsideration if the initial ALJ decision had been revised based upon a previous motion
for reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that other agencies permit a party to file
a motion for reconsideration at any time, as of right, on the basis of material error, new evidence, or substantially
changed circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that with the modification
to &sect;283.17(d)(3) allowing all parties to the appeal to respond to the initial motion for reconsideration, any
further requests for review of the ALJ's decision should be made to the Judicial Officer.

This section of the NPRM contains the procedures related to the filing of motions and requests with the ALJ or the Judicial
Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response to motions and requests: In &sect;283.18(d) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a party have 20 days
to respond to a motion or request and that the party initiating the motion or request not be permitted to reply to the
response of the other party unless ordered to do so by the ALJ.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter argued that by not being permitted to file a reply
brief, the party initiating the motion or request is disadvantaged since the initiating party would not have access
to arguments raised in response to the motion or request. The commenter recommended that one response be allowed each
party after the initial motion and response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. This provision is in keeping with the congressional
intent that the appeal process be streamlined and that the appeal procedures be as expeditious as possible. Since
the ALJ can direct 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that a reply be filed either to clarify issues or upon motion in those instances where a party believes that a reply is
necessary, the Department believes that restricting the number of responses to a motion or request which may be filed
would not be disadvantage to the party initiating the motion or request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also revised the 20-day time frame to respond to a motion or request in order to address the statutory
deadlines established by section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act for the completion of the appeals process. Given these
deadlines, the Department has shortened the 20-day time frame to 10 days unless an extension has been requested and

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received four comments on this provision. The commenters objected to this provision arguing that
the HPA prohibits Secretarial review of decisions made by the ALJ. The commenters recommended that the Department
delete this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered these comments but has decided not to adopt the recommendation to forgo Secretarial
review of the initial ALJ decision. As discussed under &sect;283.17(c)(3), the Department has revised the regulations
to provide that the initial decision of the ALJ shall be considered final for purposes of judicial review. However,
this would not preclude any party to the appeal from seeing reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Department's
Judicial Officer within 30 days of the ALJ's decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's position that the specific incorporation of section 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) (5 U.S.C. 557) by section 603 of the HPA necessarily means that the Secretary is authorized to review ALJ decisions.
Indeed, the APA expressly provides that an agency action can be final for purposes of the APA, and thus for purposes
of judicial review, even though it is subject to reconsideration or appeal to a higher authority within the agency.
5 U.S.C. 704. This interpretation is consistent with both the expressed statutory language and legislative history
of section 603 of the HPA.

 Memorandum for Alan C. Raul, General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, from Douglas R. Cox, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice (February 20, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also determined that review by the Secretary of issues raised on appeal is a more efficient process
for resolving disputes concerning initial ALJ decisions that if such issues were brought to the federal courts without
providing the Secretary the opportunity to review and, if necessary, revise such decisions. The Secretary has delegated
to the Judicial Officer the authority to act as the final deciding officer in adjudicatory proceedings subject to
5 U.S.C. 556 and 557. Section 283.20 will permit the Judicial Officer, on behalf of the Secretary, to address the party's
objections to the initial ALJ decision, to apply expertise on the issues under review, exercise informed discretion,
and create a more concise record for any subsequent judicial review. This procedure will also ensure that there is
continuity in the decisions which are rendered for cases involving similar issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submission of briefs: In &sect;283.20(h)(i) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that if the Judicial Officer determined
that there were reasonable grounds that additional evidence which is material was not presented to the ALJ, the Judicial
Officer shall remand the matter back to the ALJ for disposition.

Comment:

to limit materials presented to the Judicial Officer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that the Judicial Officer reviews the record created
before the ALJ. However, if a party to the appeal can persuade the Judicial Officer that there are reasonable grounds

This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which are to be followed if the appeal is being pursued under subpart
C_Summary Procedures for Appeal of QC Claims of Less than $50,000.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter expressed a concern that the 35 page limitation
on the brief accompanying the motion for summary judgment and the 15 page reply brief limitation were too restricted
and recommended that a higher page limit be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department considered this comment but decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that given the authority
of the ALJ to increase the size of the brief and reply brief, the page limitations are reasonable. These page limits
are consistent with congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. The Department has also made changes
to subpart C to conform to the timeframes specified in the Leland Act.

Interrogatories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A party may submit written interrogatories to any other party to an appeal. The time for submitting and responding
to written interrogatories shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference, but in no event shall the time for
response be less than 20 days from the date of service or within such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ. The number
of interrogatories submitted by each party shall not exceed twenty-five questions including subparts, unless additional
interrogatories are authorized by the ALJ. Each interrogatory should be answered separately and fully in writing,
unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection should be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers
are to be signed under penalty of perjury by the person making them. Objections shall be signed by the attorney of record
in the appeal or by the responding party's authorized representative.

Request for admissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A party may submit a written request for admission of the truth of any matters relevant to the appeal to any other party
to the appeal. The time for submitting a written request for admission shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference.
The number of admissions contained in a request submitted by a party shall not exceed twenty-five unless additional
admissions are authorized by the ALJ. The matter is admitted unless, within 20 days after service thereof, or within
such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting
the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter signed by the party, counsel or designated representative.
If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. The answer should specifically deny the matter or set
forth in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. An answering party may not give
lack of information or knowledge as a reason for the failure to admit or deny unless it is stated that reasonable inquiry
has been made and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny.
A party who considers that a matter for which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may
not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may deny the matter or set forth reasons why the matter cannot
be admitted or denied.

 (i) Any party may serve upon any other party to the appeal a request for production of documents which are in the possession
or control of the party upon whom the request is served. The time for service and response to such a request shall be set
by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference. Upon payment of fees for search and duplication of documents, any party to
the appeal may obtain copies of such documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Parties may request production of any documents regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action. Grounds for objection will not exist if the information sought appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 A party who knows or later learns that a response is incorrect is under a duty to correct such response as soon as possible.
A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under a duty to supplement
the response to include information thereafter acquired. A party is under a duty to supplement responses with respect
to any question directly addressed to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The ALJ shall limit, upon motion of a party, the frequency or extent of discovery if the ALJ determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that
is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy,
limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.

 In issuing a protective order, the ALJ may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That discovery not be had;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a deponent fails to respond or gives an evasive or incomplete answer to a question propounded at a deposition pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this section or a party fails to respond or gives evasive or incomplete answers to written interrogatories
or admissions, or fails to respond, in full or in part, to a request for production of documents served pursuant to paragraph

Decision of the ALJ.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The ALJ may grant a motion to compel production or deny a motion for a protective order only if the ALJ finds that the
discovery sought is necessary for the expeditious, fair, and reasonable consideration of the issues; it is not unduly
costly or burdensome; it will not unduly delay the proceeding; and the information sought is not privileged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The initial decision of the ALJ regarding the motion to compel the production of privileged documents or the motion
for a protective order shall become final and effective 10 days after service unless either party pursues the options
as discussed in &sect;&sect;283.17(d) and 283.20.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of the ALJ, such refusal may subject the refusing party to proceedings to compel compliance with the ALJ's order in
the appropriate United States district court.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A party may request a hearing on the facts by including such request in its Appeal Petition or Answer, whichever is appropriate.
Failure to request a hearing within the time specified shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity for such a hearing,
except as provided for under &sect;283.4(i). In the event FNS denies any material facts and fails to request a hearing,
the matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the State agency or upon the ALJ's own motion.

and the convenience and necessity of the State agency and FNS. The hearing shall be held at the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC. Upon a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances, the ALJ may order that the hearing be held
at another location. The ALJ shall file a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. If any change in the time of
the hearing is made, the ALJ shall file a notice of such change, which notice shall be served upon the parties, unless
it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made a part of the transcript or actual notice given to the parties.

(1) Witness and rebuttal witness lists, copies of prior statements of proposed witnesses, and copies of proposed
hearing exhibits, including copies of any written statements or depositions that a party intends to offer in lieu
of live testimony in accordance with &sect;283.12(a)(7), shall be exchanged at least 15 days in advance of the hearing
or at such other time as may be set by the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A witness whose name does not appear on the witness list shall not be permitted to testify and exhibits which were
not provided to the opposing party as provided above shall not be admitted into evidence at the hearing absent a showing
of cause and as authorized by the ALJ.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deparment of attorney or representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Whenever an ALJ finds that a person acting as attorney or designated representative for any party to the appeal
is guilty of unethical or contumacious conduct in, or in connection with an appeal, the ALJ may order that such person
be precluded from further acting as attorney or representative in the appeal. Review by the Judicial Officer may be
taken on any such order, but no appeal of the QC claim shall be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the debarment
review by the Judicial Officer. Provided, however, that the ALJ shall suspend the appeal of the QC claim for a reasonable
time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain another attorney or representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever it is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that a person who is acting or who has acted as attorney
or representative for another person in any proceeding before the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is unfit to act
as such counsel because of such unethical or contumacious conduct, such person will be precluded from acting as the
attorney or representative in any or all proceedings before the Department as found to be appropriate.

Failure to appear. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If FNS or the State agency, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without cause, that party shall
be deemed to have waived the opportunity for an oral hearing and to have admitted any facts which may be presented at
the hearing. Such failure by either party shall also constitute an admission of all the material allegations of fact
contained in any pleadings submitted by the other party. The party who appears shall have the option of whether to follow
the procedure under &sect;283.7 or to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of declarations or by oral testimony
before the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the ALJ's initial

in accordance with &sect;283.20.

Order of proceeding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as may be decided otherwise by the ALJ, FNS shall proceed first at the hearing. FNS has the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence, the QC claim against the State agency for a QC error rate in excess of the tolerance
level. The State agency will proceed second and must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts upon which
it bases its appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evidence.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upon a finding of cause, the ALJ may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses
except those who may be parties to the appeal or whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation
of the party's cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After a witness called by either party has testified on direct examination, any other party may request and obtain
the production of any statement, or part thereof, of such witness in the possession of the opposing party which relates
to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. Such production shall be made according to the procedures
and subject to the definitions and limitations prescribed in the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded by order of the ALJ insofar as practicable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Inclusion in the record.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the oral hearing or as ordered by the ALJ, depositions to the extent deemed admissible, written interrogatories,
written requests for admission and respective responses may be offered in evidence by the party at whose instance
they were taken. If not offered by such party, they may be offered in whole or in part by any other party. If only part of
a deposition, written interrogatory, written request for admission or response thereto is offered in evidence by
a party, any other party may require that all of it, which is relevant to the part introduced, be offered, and any party
may introduce any other parts. Such depositions, written interrogatories, written requests for admission and respective

If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript in toto. If the evidence consists
of a document or other exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record. In either
event, if the Judicial Officer, upon review, determines that the ALJ's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous
and prejudicial, the evidence shall be considered a part of the transcript and hearing record. If the Judicial Officer
determines that the ALJ's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, and that it would inappropriate
to have such evidence considered a part of the hearing record without reopening the hearing, the Judicial Officer
may direct that the hearing be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence or for any other purpose in connection
with the excluded evidence.

The failure by FNS to file an answer shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to file a cross motion for summary judgment
pursuant to &sect;283.30. Upon such failure to file, the State agency shall file a proposed decision, along with a
motion for adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon FNS by the State agency. Within 10 days after service
of such motion and proposed decision, FNS may file with the Hearing Clerk objections thereto. If the ALJ finds that
meritorious objections have been filed, the State agency's motion shall be denied with supporting reasons. If meritorious
objections are not filed, the ALJ shall issue an initial decision without further procedures. Copies of the decision
or denial of State agency's motion shall be served on each of the parties and shall be included as part of the official
record. Where the decision as proposed by the State agency is adopted as the ALJ's initial decision, such decision
of the ALJ shall become final and effective 30 days after service unless reconsideration or review by the Judicial
Officer is sought as discussed in &sect;&sect;283.17(d) and 283.20.

On January 12, 1987, the Ballistic Recovery System, Inc. (BRS), 9242 Hudson Boulevard, Lake Elmo, Minnesota 55042,
filed an application for a supplemental type certificate (STC) to install the GARD&hyph;150 parachute recovery
system on Cessna 150/A150 Series and 152/A152 Model Airplanes. Subsequently, they received the STC under Special
Condition 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;33, dated November 17, 1987. The parachute recovery system is intended to recover an
airplane in emergency situations such as mid-air collision, loss of engine power, loss of airplane control, sever
structural failure, pilot disorientation, or pilot incapacitation with a passenger on board. The GARD&hyph;150
system, which is only used as a last resort, is intended to prevent serious injuries to the airplane occupants by parachuting
the airplane to the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BRS followed their STC on the Cessna 150/A150 and 152/A152 Series with request for special conditions on the General
Aviation Recovery Device (GARD) system that would be applicable to most general aviation airplanes. The nature of
the parachute recovery system applies to most general aviation airplanes with similar configurations and characteristics.
Separate special conditions for each airplane model are not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parachute recovery systems typically consist of a parachute packed in a canister mounted on the airframe. A solid
propellant rocket motor or compressed air may deploy the canopy and is usually located on the side of the canister.
A door positioned above the canister seals the canister, parachute canopy, and rocket motor from the elements and
provides free exit when the canopy is deployed. These systems are deployed by a mechanical pull handle mounted so that
the pilot and passenger can reach it. At least two separate and independent actions are required to deploy the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A multicable bridle attaches the canopy bridle to the airplane primary structure. The cable lengths are designed
to provide the best airplane touchdown attitude. The cables are routed externally and covered with small frangible
fairings from the fuselage exist holes to the attach points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicants must supplement the FAA-approved Flight Manual as part of the STC. The supplement will describe the
system, define the operating envelope with appropriate warnings, and define required system maintenance and inspection
information. A separate FAA-approved Operating Manual describing the previous items will be provided for those
airplanes that do not have an FAA-approved Flight Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommended placards should be located near the pull handle in clear view of the pilot to identify the system and operating
envelope, state deployment actions, and provide appropriate warnings. A warning placard should also be located
on the canister near the rocket motor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The installation of parachute recovery systems in part 23, VLA, and primary category airplanes was not envisioned
when the certification basis for these airplanes was established. In addition, the Administrator has determined
that current regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for a parachute recovery system;
therefore, this system is considered a novel and unusual design feature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part of the type certification basis if the Administrator
finds that the airworthiness standards designated in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(1) do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards because of the novel and unusual design features of the airplane modification. Special
conditions, as appropriate, are issued after public notice in accordance with &sect;11.49 (as amended October 25,
1989), as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b). The special conditions become part of the type certification
basis, as provided by &sect;21.17(a)(2).

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Notice of Proposed Special Conditions, Docket No. 118CE, Notice No. 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;76 (59 FR 2786, January 19,
1994) proposed special conditions for small general aviation airplanes. The comment period for the notice closed
March 21, 1994. Four comments were received from one commenter. All comments were concerning the flight portion of
these special conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believes that the wording of the proposed special conditions indicates that flight test may be required
for each make and model of aircraft for which the GARD system will be installed. The commenter does not believe this
is necessary for airplanes with similar characteristics such as configuration, weight, and speed. To support this
position, the commenter cites TSO&hyph;C23c for emergency personnel parachutes that are certified according to
suspended weight and maximum allowable deployment speed. The commenter states that significant configuration
changes would be low wing versus high wing or a change in the position of the parachute main attach point relative to
the aircraft center of gravity. A significant change in airplane characteristics could be defined as any variation
that could potentially cause the airplane to react to parachute deployment different from the original tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In this case, a flight demonstration of satisfactory deployment would be required unless a reliable method of analysis
is available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with the commenter that the wording of the proposal infers that the flight demonstrations are required
for each airplane model receiving the STC. This was not the FAA's original intent with these special conditions. The
FAA agrees with the commenter that the GARD system is intended to add a means of preventing a catastrophic crash when
all other means of recovery are exhausted or made inoperative. To this end, this system adds to the overall safety of
the airplane. Therefore, the FAA agrees with the commenter's approach to different airplanes with similar characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also believes that special condition 1(b)(3) should state: Maneuvering speed with 2g normal load,
not Og normal load. The original flight tests included a 60 degree bank turn with a 2g normal load for one deployment
condition. Essentially, the deployment condition was the airplane turning into the parachute deployment. The test
evaluated both deployment during a turn and the force of the ballistics to eject the parachute away from the airplane
in a way that would allow it to open. The possible concern was not having enough load on the parachute to properly inflate
the canopy. The results on the original GARD&hyph;150 were satisfactory. The FAA's reason for requiring the Og test
was to evaluate additional deployment loads against the airframe limits. In re-evaluating this requirement, the
FAA believes that data from static tests and the stall condition deployment will adequately address the concerns.
Additionally, since the 2g test requirement from the original GARD system was satisfactory, the FAA finds no reason
to evaluate the opening during a 2g turn on each airplane that requires deployment testing. A 2g acceleration is the
same regardless of the type airplane. If the GARD system had the force to fire the parachute away from the airplane while
the airplane was turning toward the parachute, then the results should be the same for other airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter thought that there should be an option of placarding the operating limitations as an alternative to
testing at the never exceed speed 1(b)(i)(4) and in inverted flight for aerobatic aircraft 1(b)(ii). Satisfactory
deployment would be demonstrated at a maximum placarded deployment speed with 1g normal load. This maximum placarded
deployment speed should be greater than or equal to the structural cruising speed of the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA conducted a thorough evaluation of the first system to be STC'd on a certified airplane. The FAA's interest
with follow-on modifications to similar airplanes is primarily to investigate deployment at the airplane's limits.
It is realistic to expect pilots to deploy this system in an inadvertent spin, at minimum speed (stall), and at the never
exceed speed. By testing at these limits, all conditions in between are covered. The only exception might be high g
loads from aerobatic airplanes. Any situation where the GARD system is deployed will either be 1g or less (i.e., normal
gliding flight through spins), or completely unloaded, or tumbling from a structural failure. It is not reasonable
to expect any applicant to test for the tumbling after a structural failure. In an out-of-control situation (structural
failure), the airplane could quickly reach its never exceed speed. So the requirement to deploy the GARD system at
the never exceed speed will remain. However, since the argument for aerobatic airplane has been presented, including
the operational reality of an inverted deployment, the FAA agrees with the commenter that the merits of requiring
the test are far outweighted by the cost to conduct the test. Therefore, the option of placarding against operating
the GARD system during aerobatics is supported.

Adoption of Special Condition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
issues the following special conditions as part of the supplemental type certification basis for the BRS GARD system
installed in small general aviation airplanes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Flight Test Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The system must be demonstrated in flight to satisfactorily perform its intended function, without exceeding
the system deployment load factors, for the critical flight conditions, except as allowed in 1(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Satisfactory deployment of the parachute must be demonstrated, at the most critical airplane weight and balance,
for the following flight conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Power off stall with slow entry,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Spin with deployment at one turn,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Never exceed speed with 1g normal load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Flight demonstrations are not required for airplanes with similar characteristics, (such as configuration,
weight, and speed) to airplanes that have already received an STC for the installation. Only airplanes where a significant
change from airplanes that have already received an STC need to include a flight demonstration. A significant change
in airplane characteristics could be defined as any variation that could potentially cause the airplane to react
to parachute deployment different from original tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA received a report from an operator that cracking was found in the lower spar chord of a strut on a Boeing
Model 757 series airplane equipped with a Rolls Royce Model RB211&hyph;535 series engine. This cracking penetrated
through the inboard flange of the chord and propagated into the skin flange of the chord. This fatigue crack in the skin
flange was approximately five inches in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis indicates that stiffener straps, which were installed on early production airplanes, increase the likelihood
of cracking in the spar chords. These stiffener straps are no longer installed on later production airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued operation with the stiffener straps installed will cause fatigue cracking or propagation of existing
cracks in the lower chord. Such cracking could result in the inability of the strut to carry required engine support
loads, and ultimately could lead to separation of the engine from the strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;54&hyph;0028, dated March 31, 1994, that describes
procedures for eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the lower spar chord of the engine strut, removal of the
stiffener straps from the mid-chord, open hole eddy current inspection of the fastener holes, and modification.
This modification, which includes installing fasteners, a strut pneumatic duct, a fire extinguisher line, a bulkhead
coverplate, and a panel, will decrease the likelihood of fatigue cracking in the lower spar chord of the engine strut.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Boeing Model 757 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent cracking of the lower spar chord of the engine strut. This
AD requires eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the lower spar chord of the engine strut, removal of the stiffener
straps from the mid-chord, open hole eddy current inspection of the fastener holes, and modification. The actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. In certain cases,
this AD requires repair of cracking in accordance with an FAA-approved method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;85&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes, that requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of certain attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved clamps. This amendment is prompted by reports of failures of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamps due to fatigue cracking. The actions specified by this AD are intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent such failures, which could cause exhaust gas to leak and, subsequently, could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trigger a false engine fire alarm.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61636). That action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to require replacement of certain attachment clamps installed on the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust ducts with improved clamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that paragraph (b) of the rule be revised to indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions for verifying that the clamp screw is straight are contained in Dassault 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993 (which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the service bulletin cited elsewhere in the proposed rule). The commenter notes that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions indicate that the verification cannot be made if the clamp is installed; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clamp must be removed from the tail pipe attachment in order to determine if it is bent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request and has revised the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 133 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,315, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability: Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes, serial numbers 2 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
216, inclusive; equipped with exhaust duct attachment clamps, part number (P/N) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NH1002299&hyph;10 or P/N NH1007763&hyph;10; certificated in any category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could cause exhaust gas to leak and, subsequently, could trigger a false engine fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alarm, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For airplanes equipped with exhaust duct attachment clamps having P/N 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NH1002299&hyph;10: Within 300 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, or within 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, replace attachment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clamps having P/N NH1002299&hyph;10 with attachment clamps having P/N NH1007763&hyph;10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For airplanes equipped with exhaust duct attachment clamps having P/N 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NH1007763&hyph;10: Within 1,400 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, inspect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts to verify if the clamp screw is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straight (not bent), in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the clamp screw is straight, prior to further flight, verify if the tightening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
torque value of the screw is marked on the attachment clamp as follows: ``NORMAL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NET TORQUE 100&hyph;120 IN-LBS.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the marking is as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, no further action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the marking is not as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further flight, erase the incorrect marking and replace it with the correct tightening torque

value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) After correcting the marking, prior to further flight, ensure that the clamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screw is secured to the tightening torque value specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the clamp screw is bent, prior to further flight, replace the discrepant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamp with a new attachment clamp having the same part number, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install an exhaust duct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamp having P/N NH1007763&hyph;10 on any airplane, unless that attachment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clamp is marked ``NORMAL NET TORQUE 100&hyph;120 IN-LBS.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action establishes Class E5 airspace at Griffith, Indiana, to accommodate a new VOR/DME Runway 26 Standard Instrument
Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Griffith-Merrillville Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to
1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action
is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other
aircraft operating in visual weather conditions.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Griffith, Indiana, to accommodate a new VOR/DME Runway 26 SIAP to Griffith-Merrillville Airport (59
FR 22571). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet to 1200 feet AGL for Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between
the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding
by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Griffith, Indiana,
to accommodate a new VOR/DME Runway 26 SIAP to Griffith-Merrillville Airport. Controlled airspace extending from
700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 21, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the regulations for emergency locator transmitters (ELT's)
(59 FR 32050). As discussed in the preamble to that final rule, the FAA intended to include in the language of &sect;91.207
a date after which ELT's that meet Technical Standard Order (TSO) C91 could no longer be installed in aircraft. That
language was inadvertently omitted from the amendment to Section 91.207. This document presents only the omitted
rule language for paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;91.207.

 This rule brings up to date the Department's existing regulations relating to administrative claims to reflect current
statutory authority for federal agencies to compromise, terminate or suspend collection activities on claims of
the Government up to $100,000 without prior approval from the Department of Justice. The existing regulation limits
such collection activities to debts up to $20,000. The rule also makes two other technical amendments_one relating
to the assessment of interest on claims due to the Department and one relating to the distribution of certain final
decisions on indebtedness made by HUD Deputy Assistant Secretaries.

(or to suspend or end collection action) on a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest)
or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe provided that the claim has not been referred
to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action. Prior to amendment of this section by the
Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;552, 104 Stat. 2736, Approved November 15, 1990) this authority
of agencies to compromise, or to suspend or end collection actions on government claims was limited to claims of $20,000
or less.

Existing HUD regulations (24 CFR Part 17 (Administrative Claims) contain a number of provisions setting forth the
now out of date dollar threshold of $20,000 rather than the $100,000 threshold which the statute (31 U.S.C. 3711(a))
currently authorizes. This rule updates HUD regulations (Subpart C of 24 CFR Part 17_Procedures for the Collection
of Claims by the Government) to reflect the new $100,000 statutory threshold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations_17 CFR 17.72(e)_provide for assessment of interest on claims due the Department at 7 percent.
This rule revises this provision to provide for the assessment of interest at the Treasury rate in effect when the demand
for payment is made, as provided in the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act
of 1982, and in the joint regulations of the Attorney General and Comptroller General at 4 CFR Parts 101&hyph;105 (joint
regulations).

When a debt is paid in installments and interest is collected, installment payments will first be applied to the payment
of accrued interest and then to principal in accordance with the so-called ``U.S. Rule'' unless a different rule is
prescribed by statute, contract or regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Debt Collection Act of 1982 specifically provides for the assessment of interest and, in 1984, the joint regulations
were amended to reflect the provisions of that Act. Reference to the ``U.S. Rule'' was properly deleted from the amended
joint regulations and a reference to 31 U.S.C. 3717, the statutory provision authorizing agencies to assess interest
on debts, was substituted. In this rule, as was done in the amended joint regulations, the obsolete reference to the
so called ``U.S. Rule'' is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in 24 CFR 17.110, a section relating to final decisions on amounts of indebtedness made by HUD Deputy Assistant
Secretaries or their designees, paragraph (b) providing that copies of the final decisions will be distributed to
the General Counsel, the Office of Finance and Accounting, and the debtors (or their attorneys or representatives
if applicable) is revised so that it only provides for copies to debtors (or their attorneys or representatives, if
applicable). The change reflects HUD policy that any provisions relating to distribution of documents within the
Department should not be included in a regulation designed to inform the public of its rights and obligations. Such
provisions are more appropriate in a handbook or other internal HUD directive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the strictly technical nature of this rule, and the fact that the statutory provisions involved are, at any rate,
self enforcing, the Department has determined that notice and public comment procedure under Title 5 of the United
States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as a final rule.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule is technical in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies.

This subpart sets forth the regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development implementing the Federal
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Federal Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) (the Act),
in conformity with the standards jointly promulgated by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General in 4 CFR
parts 101 through 105. The Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requires the Secretary or his designee to attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or property
arising out of the activities of the Department; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Authorizes the Secretary or his designee to compromise claims that have not been referred to another executive
or legislative agency for further collection action where the claim does not exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest,
or to suspend or terminate collection action where it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective
financial ability to pay any significant sum thereon or that the cost of collecting the claim is likely to exceed the
amount of recovery.

Subdivision and joining of claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract shall be considered as a single claim in
determining whether the claim is one not exceeding $100,000 exclusive of interest for the purpose of compromise or
termination of collection action. Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Joining of two or more single claims in a demand upon a particular debtor for payment totaling more than $100,000
does not preclude compromise or termination of collection action with respect to any one of such claims that does not
exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest.

except as provided in &sect;17.65 and paragraph (b) of this section. When initial attempts at collection by the office
having responsibility for such claims have not been fully successful, the claim file shall be forwarded to the Assistant
Secretary for Administration for further administrative collection procedures. Claims shall be referred to the
Assistant Secretary for Administration well within the applicable statute of limitations (28 U.S.C. 2415 and 2416),
but in no event more than 2 years after the claims accrued.

Interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where prejudgment interest is not mandated by statute, contract or regulation, the minimum rate of interest to be
charged on delinquent debts is the Tax and Loan Account Rate for the U.S. Treasury (also known as the Current Value of
Funds rate) as prescribed and published semiannually by the Secretary of the Treasury in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Prejudgment interest may be waived as an inducement to voluntary payment. In such
cases demand letters should inform the debtor that prejudgment interest will be collected if suit becomes necessary.
When a debt is paid in installments and interest is collected, installment payments will first be applied to the payment
of accrued interest and then to principal unless a different rule is prescribed by statute, contract or regulation.
Prejudgment interest shall not be demanded or collected on civil penalty and forfeiture claim unless the statute
under which the claim arises authorizes the collection of such interest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has received several requests to extend the effective date of paragraph (d), hazard assessment, and paragraph
(f), training. It is contended that many employers will not be able to complete the required hazard assessment and
training before the effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has also received petitions from the American Forest &amp; Paper Association (AF&amp;PA), the American Iron
and Steel Institute (AISI), and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association (CMA) to delay the effective date of the
provisions for hazard assessment and training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been asserted that a worksite hazard assessment, where not previously performed, could be a major undertaking.
Also, longer periods of time may be necessary if an employer determines that there is a need for task-specific assessments
or training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in its petition to the Agency, AISI stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, employers may determine that there is a need for task-specific hazard assessments or training. As the
compliance effort moves along the continuum from generic toward task-specific, a substantially longer period of
time would be required to comply with the final rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has also been asserted that it would take a substantial amount of time to develop and implement the type of training
program that is envisioned by the final rule. Even where training programs do exist, some may not meet all of the requirements
of the final rule, and employers would not be able to implement changes to these programs before the effective date.
In its petition to OSHA, AF&amp;PA remarked:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While some employers may have performed the required hazard assessments and provided the required training, they
may not be fully comfortable certifying that their employees have the necessary knowledge and abilities with respect
to PPE without some form of verification. Some employers may find gaps or weak points in their existing PPE programs.
Other employers will find that their existing PPE programs are so informal that they will conclude they must begin
from ``ground zero.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating these comments, OSHA has decided that it is reasonable to allow an additional amount of time for employers
to meet the requirements pertaining to the hazard assessment (&sect;1910.132(d)) and training (&sect;1910.132(f)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency is granting an administrative stay of the effective date for paragraphs (d) and (f) of &sect;1910.132
until October 5, 1994 to allow employers an additional amount of time to achieve compliance with these two paragraphs.
OSHA expects that employers will continue to expedite their efforts to fully comply with all of the provisions of the
standard. It is also important to note that the effective date for all of the other provisions of the final rule remains
July 5, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart establishes restrictions governing the operation of unauthorized vehicles, motorized and non-motorized,
on the army training areas of Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, as defined in &sect;552.134 of this subpart. Unauthorized
vehicles are restricted to paved roads on the installation of Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) These restrictions are established to prevent the interruption of the use of these Army training areas by any person

be dangerous to unauthorized persons entering these areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, these restrictions have been established to prevent property damage, threatening of endangered
flora and fauna in the areas, and to prevent the harassment of protected species such as the Blue Heron and the Indiana
Bat by any person or persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This order revokes a Secretarial order, as modified, insofar as it affects 80.13 acres of public land withdrawn for
Air Navigation Site No. 136 at Thompson Pass. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn.
This action also modifies a public land order to allow the State of Alaska's existing application for selection to
attach, and classifies the land as suitable for conveyance of the land to the State, if such land is otherwise available.
If not conveyed to the State, the land will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of Public Land Order No.
5150, as amended, and any other withdrawal of record. This order does not otherwise change the provisions or limitations
of Public Land Order No. 5150, as amended, or any other withdrawal of record.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces an adjustment of the ending date of the annual closure of the shrimp fishery in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Texas. The closure normally ends on July 15 each year. Because biological data indicate that brown shrimp
leaving the Texas estuaries will have reached the desired size by July 7, 1994, the ending date is changed to this earlier
date. The Texas closure is intended to prohibit the harvest of brown shrimp during their major period of emigration
from Texas estuaries to the Gulf of Mexico so the shrimp may reach a larger, more valuable size and to prevent the waste
of brown shrimp that would be discarded in fishing operations because of their small size.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of
Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR part 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.). The FMP's implementing regulations at 50 CFR 658.25 describe the Texas closure and provide for adjustments to
the beginning and ending dates by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, under specified criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Available information meeting the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b)(1) indicates that an early ending of the
Texas closure is warranted and desirable. Biological data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department indicate
that ending the closure on July 7, 1994, will provide adequate protection of small brown shrimp emigrating from the
Texas estuaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the time and date at 50 CFR 658.25(a) for ending the Texas closure is changed from 30 minutes after sunset,
July 15, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset on July 7, 1994. During the closure, the area described at 50 CFR 658.25(a)
is closed to all trawl fishing, except that a vessel may fish for royal red shrimp beyond the 100&hyph;fathom (183&hyph;m)
depth contour. The waters of Texas are also closed during this period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the CAD was established by the final 1994 initial
specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for
Atka mackerel was closed on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29964, June 10, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of June 11, 1994, 2,201
mt remain unharvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the 1994 TAC for Atka mackerel in the CAD has not been reached.
Therefore, NMFS is rescinding the June 7, 1994, closure and is reopening directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the
CAD, effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., July 4, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is amending the requirements for warning devices for stopped commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) to allow the
use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles, unless the CMV is transporting
certain hazardous materials or is powered by compressed gas. It is the intent of this final rule to give equal priority
to fusees and liquid-burning flares with regard to use as emergency warning devices. This action is required by the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.

Section 1041(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240,
105 Stat. 1914, 1993), signed by the President on December 18, 1991, requires that ``Section 393.95 of title 49 of the
Code of Federal Regulations shall be applied so that fusees and flares are given equal priority with regard to use as
reflecting signs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 14, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend &sect;393.95 to allow commercial
motor vehicles to be equipped with fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles,
except CMVs transporting explosives (Division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 hazardous materials), cargo tank motor vehicles
used for flammable and combustible liquids (Class 3 hazardous materials) or flammable gas (Division 2.1 hazardous
materials) (whether loaded or empty), or motor vehicles using compressed gas as a motor fuel. The FHWA also proposed
amending &sect;392.22(b), which sets forth requirements for the placement and use of warning devices for stopped
vehicles, because paragraph (b) did not allow the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional
reflective triangles.

The FHWA proposed that vehicles be equipped with either (1) three bidirectional reflective triangles or (2) six fusees
or liquid-burning flares. With regard to performance standards for fusees and liquid-burning flares, the FHWA proposed
to amend &sect;393.95(j) to require that these devices be capable of burning for at least 30 minutes, and meet the standards
of the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., Highway Emergency Signals (UL 912).

Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA received 12 comments to the NPRM. The commenters were: 3M; Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates);
the American Trucking Associations (ATA); Chemical Waste Transportation Institute (CWTI); Cortina Tool and Molding
Company; James King and Company, Inc.; Federal Mogul; National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc.; Ohio University, College
of Engineering and Technology, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering; Pyrotechnic Signal Manufacturers
Association (PSMA); Sate-Lite Manufacturing Company (Sate-Lite); and the Transportation Safety Equipment Institute
(TSEI). The commenters were generally opposed to allowing the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional
reflective triangles. The CWTI did not support or oppose the proposal but indicated that the FHWA should retain its
restrictions on flame producing devices on certain vehicles and recommended that the FHWA use this rulemaking to
amend &sect;393.95(g) to incorporate the use of the current hazardous materials classifications (i.e., Divisions
1.1, 1.2, or 1.3, 2.1 and Class 3). The PSMA provided the only comments in support of the proposed amendments.

Interpretation of Section 1041(b) of the ISTEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the commenters questioned the FHWA's interpretation of section 1041(b) of the ISTEA. Sate-Lite believes
that section 1041(b) is ambiguous and as such the FHWA has great latitude in the implementation of the requirement.
Sate-Lite stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By explicitly acknowledging the safety hazards associated with fusees and flares and by specifically addressing
these hazards by prohibiting the use of fusees and flares in certain situations, the FHWA has recognized that ISTEA
granted the FHWA broad discretion in implementing Section 1041(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clearly Congress did not anticipate or intend to require that the FHWA sacrifice motorist safety and the security
of our federal highway system on the altar of ``equal priority.'' As the FHWA has recognized, on these issues of motorist
safety, Congress must defer to the expertise and judgment of the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the dangers and manifest deficiencies inherent in the use of fusees and flares as a substitute for warning
triangles *&blank;*&blank;* Sate-Lite respectfully urges the FHWA to exercise its discretion by amending the proposed
rule change. Sate-Lite strongly believes that the FHWA should continue to require motor carriers to carry three emergency
warning triangles in accordance with the current rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments, the ATA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of Section 1041(b) of the [ISTEA] strongly suggests that its sponsor(s) believe[s] that a fusee and a
liquid-burning flare are essentially similar&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*. It should be made clear that fusees are
acceptable only as a short-term warning device for use while long-term warning devices are put in place. In addition,
it should be made clear that the trucking industry abandoned the use of liquid-burning flares (pot torches) as soon
as the use of a superior type of warning device (the ``dot-over-dot'' emergency reflectors) was authorized by federal
and state regulators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons outline[d] above, liquid-burning flares have not been manufactured for 30 years, or more. In our view,
the current effort to encourage a return to their use by the motor carrier industry is a step backward. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates did not believe that the ISTEA prohibits the FHWA from continuing to require that each CMV be equipped with
three bidirectional reflective triangles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that section 1041(b) of ISTEA requires that fusees and liquid-burning flares be allowed, but not
mandated, in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles. The FHWA already allows the use of fusees and other warning
devices in addition to reflective triangles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the ATA's comments about liquid-burning flares, or ``pot torches,'' the ISTEA refers to ``fusees and
flares.'' The FHWA believes the term ``fusee'' refers to a solid material that is ignited by friction and the term ``flare''
refers to a liquid-burning warning device. These terms, as used in the ISTEA, are not interchangeable. As such, the
ISTEA allows the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares as primary emergency warning devices. While the apparent
lack of availability of liquid-burning flares, as indicated by the ATA, might preclude their use as an alternative
to bidirectional reflective triangles, the requirement of the ISTEA is not contingent upon the availability of the
warning device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Advocates' concerns, the FHWA does not believe it would be appropriate to require all CMVs to carry
bidirectional reflective triangles. For those cases in which the CMV is equipped only with fusees or liquid-burning
flares, the NPRM proposed, and this final rule includes, an amendment to &sect;392.22 stating that there shall be
at least one lighted fusee or liquid-burning flare at each of the locations specified in &sect;392.22(b)(1) for the
entire period that the vehicle is stopped. If a motor carrier chooses to rely solely upon fusees or liquid-burning
flares as emergency warning devices, the motor carrier should not be penalized by being forced to carry an additional
warning device that, under these circumstances, it would not be required to use.

Effectiveness of Fusees and Liquid-Burning Flares Versus Triangles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters opposed the use of fusees in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles because of concerns
about the effectiveness of fusees as emergency warning devices. The Advocates stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the elevation of fusees and liquid-burning flares to the status of primary warning devices alongside
triangles is a regressive step that can have serious consequences in the potential for additional truck and bus accidents.
Although there are major shortcomings with the design and performance of reflective triangles, and with the criteria
for deploying them set forth in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR), the selection of a single device
having priority in all circumstances appropriately fulfills the well-known principle of traffic engineering that
motorists should always be reinforced in their traffic control expectations when negotiating roads and streets.
That is, it is important to educate motorists to the unambiguous intent of traffic control devices by ensuring the
use of designs with unvarying shapes, sizes, colors, and messages. Despite the fact that Advocates has serious misgivings
over the retroreflective performance and conspicuity of emergency triangles, there is little question that their
consistent use over the past two decades has provided instant recognition by motorists that there is a disabled commercial
vehicle on or near the travelway. This important recognition by motorists can now be threatened by the substitution
of flares or fusees to demarcate the area around a disabled truck or bus.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Study cites the fact that triangles can be placed as far away from the vehicle as needed and the fact that they do not require
electric power. Moreover, flares and fusees: (1) Flares do not command attention because ``their light comes from
one small source and isn't very conspicuous at a distance''; (2) a flare's light may not last until help arrives; (3)
there is the obvious need for periodic replacement of flares; and (4) flares will frequently roll or blow away from
their initial site. These problems and deficiencies should be obvious even to the casual observer of highway conditions.
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

study concluded that ``Triangles provided the clearest warning from 100 feet at night.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters also referred to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report entitled ``Study of Safety-Related
Devices_Emergency Warning Devices for Disabled Vehicles'' (August 19, 1986) (NHTSA Report) to support their claims
that bidirectional reflective triangles are more effective than fusees as emergency warning devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FHWA understands the concerns of the commenters, it notes that this rulemaking is in response to section
1041(b) of the ISTEA. Section 1041(b) requires that &sect;393.95 be applied so that fusees and liquid-burning flares
are given ``equal priority'' with bidirectional reflective triangles as emergency warning devices. The congressional
mandate is not contingent upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of fusees and liquid-burning flares relative to
that of bidirectional reflective triangles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rulemaking is not intended to require the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares, but rather to
allow their use as a primary emergency warning device on certain CMVs. This final rule does not require motor carriers
to discontinue the use of bidirectional reflective triangles in favor of warning devices they believe to be less effective.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comments on whether or not motor carriers should be allowed to use a mixture of fusees, liquid-burning
flares, and bidirectional reflective triangles (e.g., a bidirectional triangle at one of the three locations warning
devices are required to be deployed, and fusees at the other locations). Sate-Lite and the TSEI believed that allowing
a mixture of warning devices would contribute to motorist confusion and uncertainty in associating the warning devices
with the stopped CMV.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA agrees with the commenters concerns about motorist ability to understand the warning devices. The FHWA believes
that the effectiveness of the three warning devices placed around the stopped vehicle would be diminished by allowing
a different type of device to be used at each location. Therefore, &sect;392.22 is being amended to require that the
same type(s) of warning devices be used at each of the locations specified in &sect;392.22.

Minimum Number of Fusees and Flares Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA proposed that CMVs equipped with only fusees or liquid-burning flares have a minimum of six of these warning
devices at all times. The ATA believed the proposed minimum was unrealistic. The ATA believed that the one hour of protection
provided by six 30-minute fusees would not be sufficient based on what they considered the ``best available information''
on the duration of CMV breakdown time under ``optimum'' conditions. The ATA also pointed out that UL 912 specifies
that each liquid-burning flare be capable of burning for 12 hours and that three of these devices should be sufficient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that a requirement for six fusees is appropriate. As stated in the NHTSA Report: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roughly one-half of all emergency stops and disabled vehicle situations last for more than 30 minutes *&blank;*&blank;*.
Moreover, since the distribution of emergency stop durations is highly positively skewed, the total disabled vehicle
exposure time for the time period of more than 30 minutes is considerably greater than for the time period of less than
30 minutes. No statistics are available to compare the ``total risk'' incurred after 30 minutes to that incurred before
30 minutes, but presumably the risk per minute is greatest soon after the emergency stop *&blank;*&blank;*. However,
the total exposure time of disabled vehicles is greater after 30 minutes due to those vehicles left for several hours
or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that a number of factors affect the amount of time a vehicle remains disabled, including its location
(e.g., urban area versus a rural area) and the availability of maintenance personnel and equipment. The FHWA believes
that the performance-based requirement that warning devices be in place for the entire period the vehicle is stopped
adequately addresses this issue. Motor carriers are responsible for ensuring that a sufficient number of warning
devices are provided on their CMVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the ATA's comments about liquid-burning flares, the FHWA agrees that the proposed requirement for
six liquid-burning flares was inconsistent with the UL 912 performance criteria which was proposed for incorporation
by reference. Because UL 912 requires that liquid-burning flares be capable of burning for 12 hours, requiring three
liquid-burning flares for vehicles which are not equipped with fusees or bidirectional reflective triangles is
sufficient.

Incorporation by Reference of UL 912 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM included a proposal that fusees and liquid-burning flares meet UL 912. In the case of fusees, UL 912 would be
used to replace the &sect;393.95(j) reference to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), ``Specifications
for Red Railway or Red Highway Fuses.'' The ATA and the PSMA were the only commenters that addressed this issue. The
ATA believed the FHWA should allow the use of fusees meeting either UL 912 or the AAR standards. The PSMA believed the
performance standards of UL 912 are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has reviewed the UL and AAR standards. The two documents have comparable performance criteria for fusees.
However, the UL document provides performance criteria for both fusees and liquid-burning flares while the AAR document
only covers fusees. The FHWA has concluded the UL document is appropriate for incorporation by reference because
the ISTEA requires that both fusees and liquid-burning flares be allowed for use as emergency warning devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the requirements contained in UL 912, the PSMA suggested that all fusees be of the ``lay-down type''
with a ``no-roll device.'' The PSMA did not provide any discussion of this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A requirement that all fusees be of the ``lay-down type'' is unnecessarily design restrictive in that it would prohibit,
without technical justification, the use of fusees that are provided with a means to remain in an upright position.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to a ``no-roll device,'' motor carriers must ensure that warning devices are in place at the required locations.
If certain devices are necessary to keep fusees in place, the motor carrier is responsible for providing them. Furthermore,
a general requirement for a ``no-roll device'' would not provide objective criteria as to what constitutes an acceptable
device. The FHWA has not adopted the PSMA's suggestions.

The FHWA is amending &sect;393.95 to allow CMVs to be equipped with fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional
reflective triangles, except CMVs transporting Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 hazardous materials (explosives), cargo
tank motor vehicles used for Class 3 (flammable and combustible liquid) or Division 2.1 (flammable gas) hazardous
materials (whether loaded or empty), or motor vehicles using compressed gas as a motor fuel. This prohibition is necessary
to minimize the risk of explosion or catastrophic fire involving cargoes and fuels of these types. The FHWA believes
the retention of this provision is consistent with congressional intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule amends &sect;393.95(f)(2) to require that CMVs be equipped with either (1) three bidirectional reflective
triangles, (2) six fusees (each capable of burning for 30 minutes), or (3) three liquid-burning flares (filled with
a sufficient amount of fuel to burn continuously for at least one hour). Although the FHWA has specified a minimum number
of fusees and liquid burning flares, motor carriers relying solely upon these devices are responsible for ensuring
that fusees or liquid-burning flares are in use for the entire time the vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion
of a highway or the shoulder of a highway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is amending &sect;392.22(b)(1) to require that the same type(s) of warning devices be used at each of the locations
where warning devices are placed around the CMV. Section 392.22(b)(2)(i)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fusees and liquid-burning flares

, is being amended to require that motor carriers relying solely upon fusees or liquid-burning flares ensure that
those devices are in use for the entire time the vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the shoulder
of a highway. The driver of the vehicle is required to extinguish and remove each fusee or liquid-burning flare before
the stopped vehicle is moved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FHWA is amending &sect;392.22(b)(2)(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Daylight hours
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to allow motor carriers to use fusees or liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles when
their CMVs are stopped during daylight hours in business or residential districts. Section 392.22(b)(2)(ii) requires
that if fusees or liquid-burning flares are used, there must be at least one lighted fusee or flare at each of the prescribed
locations as long as the vehicle is stopped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is removing &sect;392.22(b)(2)(vii) Exemption for lightweight vehicles, and certain United States Code
and CFR citations at the end of &sect;392.22. Although the NPRM did not address these issues, the amendments are considered
administrative in nature.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 19, 1988 (53 FR 18042), the FHWA published a final rule implementing the requirements of the Motor Carrier Act
of 1984. The May 19, 1988, final rule included a definition of commercial motor vehicle which with certain exceptions,
excluded lightweight vehicles (vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less) from the applicability
of the FMCSRs. Therefore, the vehicles for which paragraph (b)(2)(vii) was intended are generally not subject to
the FMCSRs and paragraph (b)(2)(vii) is obsolete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to performance standards for fusees and liquid-burning flares, the FHWA is amending &sect;393.95(j)
to require that both fusees and liquid-burning flares meet the standards of the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.,
Highway Emergency Signals (UL 912). The final rule incorporates by reference UL 912 in &sect;393.95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has created a new section, &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language of incorporation
required by 1 CFR 51 and to provide information on the availability of the incorporated document. After a review of
the comments to the July 14, 1993, NPRM and a determination that the incorporation by reference was necessary for the
final rule, the FHWA submitted UL 912 to the Director of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for approval in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522(a) and 1 CFR 51.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that some motor carriers may wish to supplement the required warning devices (reflective triangles
or fusees and flares) with other warning devices such as electric lanterns. The final rule allows the use of other warning
devices in addition to, but not in lieu of, the required devices provided they do not decrease the effectiveness of
the required devices. The FHWA has added &sect;393.95(f)(3) to clearly indicate this intent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends the requirements for warning devices for stopped vehicles. The FHWA has determined that this
is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning
of the Department of Transportation policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking
will be minimal. This final rule allows motor carriers the option to use fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of
bidirectional reflective triangles. The rule does not increase the cost of complying with the requirements for emergency
warning devices on commercial motor vehicles. Therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In their comments to the docket, both Sate-Lite and the TSEI expressed concern that the proposed regulation would
have adverse impacts on small manufacturers of bidirectional reflective triangles and small motor carriers electing
to deploy fusees or liquid-burning flares in accordance with this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these concerns, and in compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA
has evaluated the effects of this rulemaking on small entities. As for small manufacturers of bidirectional reflective
triangles, the final rule does not prohibit or restrict the manufacture, sale, or use of such devices. Furthermore,
this final rule does not require motor carriers to increase the number and types of warning devices carried on their
CMVs. Nor does the rule mandate that CMVs be equipped with only one type of warning device. Rather the rule fulfills
the requirements of section 1041(b) of the ISTEA by simply allowing, with few exceptions, the use of fusees and liquid-burning
flares as an alternative to bidirectional reflective triangles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its evaluation of this rulemaking, the FHWA certifies that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,

of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is amending the cargo securement requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs)
to adopt the use of working load limits in specifying the minimum strength of cargo securement devices. The amendment
requires that the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies used to secure an article against movement
in any direction be at least
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1/2 times the weight of the article secured. In addition, a table of working load limits is being included in the FMCSRs
to provide motor carriers with a means of determining the number of tiedown assemblies required. It is the intent of
this final rule to make the tiedown requirements easier to understand, use, and enforce. This action is in response
to a petition from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA).

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 29, 1990, the CVSA petitioned the FHWA to change the criterion for cargo tiedown assemblies from ``static
breaking strength'' to ``working load limit.'' The CVSA contends the static breaking strength of a tiedown assembly
is a rating that incorporates no safety factor, though the rule itself does include such a factor. The CVSA also believes
the use of working load limits will make the tiedown regulations easier to understand, use, and enforce. The petitioner
asserts that working load limit is the strength criterion commonly used by the chain, cordage, wire rope, and web sling
industries and that the term is widely known in the trucking industry. The use of the working load limits would thus
promote direct correlation between the rule and the capabilities labeled on or indicated by load securement equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CVSA proposed that the first sentence of &sect;393.102(b) be amended to read ``Except for integral securement
devices *&blank;*&blank;* the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies used to secure an article against
movement in any direction must be at least 1/2 times the weight of that article.'' The CVSA also proposed that chain,
webbing, wire rope, and cordage meet certain manufacturing specifications or standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 17, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 48624) to adopt the use of working
load limits and the incorporation by reference of chain, webbing, wire rope, and cordage manufacturing standards.
Although the CVSA petition did not discuss standards for steel strapping, the FHWA proposed that Federal Specification
No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880, Strapping, Steel Flat and Seals (May 13, 1980), be incorporated by reference because &sect;393.102
had referenced Federal Specification No. QQ&hyph;S&hyph;781 which has been cancelled. The FHWA believed it was
necessary to retain specific requirements for steel strapping and that Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880
was an appropriate replacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA also proposed to create a new section, &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language
of incorporation required by 1 CFR 51, as well as to include information on the availability of documents incorporated
by reference.

The FHWA received 23 comments to the NPRM. Several commenters provided more than one docket submission. The commenters
were: Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates); American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA); Department
of California Highway Patrol (CHP); Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA); Connecticut Department of Motor
Vehicles (Connecticut); Cooper Tools; The Cordage Institute; The Crosby Group, Inc.; Great American Lines, Inc.;
Illinois Department of Transportation (Illinois); Kinedyne Corporation; Maine State Police (Maine); The National
Industrial Transportation League; New York Department of Transportation (New York); Owner-Operator Independent
Drivers Association, Inc. (OOIDA); United States Representative Jack Quinn, 30th District, New York; Steel Service

Use of Working Load Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters were generally in favor of amending &sect;393.102(b) to incorporate the use of working load limits.
The CHP and Great American Lines were both opposed to the use of working load limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHP stated:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
[Static breaking strength (SBS)] is a readily determined physical parameter. Conversely, the WLL, according to
the NPRM is generally between 1/4 and 1/3 of the static breaking strength of the tiedown. The CHP is not aware of any regulation
which defines WLL. Instead, each manufacturer makes this determination for its own products. In many cases this may
be based on industry standard practice, but since these practices are voluntary, no means is available to assure conformance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In effect, the FHWA is abdicating its responsibility to determine proper tiedown standards by allowing manufacturers
to determine the WLL of their devices. It is the opinion of the CHP that this parameter is far too critical to leave to
a manufacturer's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the WLL for each type of binder is defined in the regulation, there will always be some ambiguity as to the strength
of the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, from an enforcement perspective, the WLL method could result in a hardship since WLL, based only on a factor
determined by each manufacturer, is a much harder concept for enforcement/prosecution personnel to explain in court
as opposed to the SBS, a parameter which is nearly intuitively obvious. Variations from manufacturer to manufacturer
will further complicate the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great American Lines, Inc., stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[T]he current regulations as written in []&sect;393.102 [of the] FMCS[Rs] are more than sufficient. Properly trained
drivers using the securement as specified in the current regulations will have no problem keeping the cargo on the
trailer. Education is the key, not change. The changes as proposed can only confuse the drivers, carriers and enforcement
officers and cause an extremely dangerous situation *&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing to the C.V.S.A. guidelines can serve no good purpose and will confuse the people that it is meant to regulate.
In the end the public will suffer. Don't change something that is working when properly applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its second docket submission, Great American Lines, Inc., stated that ``Neither the reasons presented in the text
of the proposal nor at the congressional hearings preceding this notice of proposed rulemaking establish a problem
with the regulation that warrant the changes being proposed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TTMA's position on the issue was contingent upon the FHWA's clarification of the term ``tiedown assemblies.''
The TTMA stated: ``If the term `tiedown assemblies,' as used in []&sect;393.102(b) includes trailer anchor points,
then we object to changing `breaking strength' to `working load limit.''' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true, as the CHP noted, that working load limits are based on each manufacturer's determination. That is also
true for static breaking strength, however, and neither value can be tested during roadside enforcement. The FHWA
notes that the terms ``static breaking strength'' and ``working load limit'' are defined in numerous technical dictionaries,
manuals, and reference books. While each manufacturer makes a determination of the working load limits of its own
products, the documents incorporated by reference, combined with certain other requirements in &sect;393.102,
eliminate the risk of voluntary or purely subjective standards. By incorporating by reference certain manufacturing
standards, this rulemaking establishes specific minimum strength requirements for five categories of securement
devices: steel strapping, chains, wire rope, cordage, and synthetic webbing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA does not believe that tiedown manufacturers will produce devices which fail to meet these minimum strength
requirements. For those cases in which the manufacturing standards do not provide specific working load limits (e.g.,
the document lists breaking strength or a working load limit range), the final rule establishes the procedure for
determining this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the final rule includes a table of working load limits for some of the most commonly used types and sizes
of tiedowns. The rule requires that the working load limits listed in the table be used when the tiedown material is
not marked with its working load limit. The values listed in the table are based on the industry standards referenced
in &sect;393.102. Therefore, the uncertainty about the strength of a tiedown is limited to tiedowns which do not meet
the manufacturing standards, and the rule prohibits the use of such tiedowns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the CHP's comments about possible difficulties in the enforcement of a working load limit requirement, it is
clear that the CVSA, whose membership includes State officials charged with enforcement, considered this issue
before petitioning the FHWA. Section 393.102 specifies the relationship between the strength rating of the tiedown
devices and the weight of the article being secured. If the strength rating and weight of the article are known, and
the relationship between the two is clearly stated in &sect;393.102, the inspecting official should not have to provide
an engineering discussion or justification of the strength rating requirement. Furthermore, as the CVSA indicated
in its petition, and as several tiedown manufacturers, manufacturers' associations, and enforcement agencies
have stated in their comments in response to the NPRM, a working load limit requirement would be easier to understand,
use, and enforce because tiedown manufacturers prefer to label their products with the working load limit as opposed
to the static breaking strength. The manufacturers believe the use of working load limits would decrease the likelihood
of accidental misuse or overloading of the tiedowns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA agrees with Great American Lines' emphasis on training and education. However, the number of accidents involving
inadequately secured cargo suggests that some motor carriers do not understand or observe the current regulations.
It must be noted that static breaking strength has been in use for approximately 20 years. During this time, education
and training have played a role in reducing the number of cargo securement-related accidents to a relatively low level.
The final rule is intended to make the cargo securement regulations easier to understand, use, and enforce in order
to further reduce the incidence of cargo securement-related accidents.

The TTMA asked whether the term ``tiedown assemblies'' in the current regulations includes trailer anchor points.
The answer is technically no, but the anchor points have to meet the same standard. Section 393.102(d) requires that
the hook, bolt, weld, or other connections by which a tiedown assembly is attached to a vehicle, and the mounting place
and means of mounting the connector, be at least as strong as the tiedown assembly. The final rule does not reference
any manufacturing standards or recommended practices for trailer anchor points nor does it require trailer manufacturers
to change their current practices regarding anchor points. However, the FHWA encourages trailer manufacturers
to provide information to motor carriers and enforcement officials about the strength of anchor points to improve
their knowledge of the cargo restraint capabilities of anchor points.

Incorporation by Reference and the Table of Working Load Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the commenters supported the inclusion of the table of working load limits in &sect;393.102 and the incorporation
by reference of certain industry standards. Several commenters, however, recommended additions and/or corrections
to the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenting in opposition to the incorporation by reference of industry standards, New York stated that ``[a]doption
by reference will cause confusion and make conformance by the industry difficult and also require the industry and
enforcement personnel to use numerous documents in determining appropriate securement methodologies. The regulations
should be self-contained and clear in their wording.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters questioned the need for including requirements for steel strapping. Maine, for example, stated:
``While strapping may be used to secure materials to pallets, it is seldom used to hold freight to a vehicle. Since the
material is not reused, it has little direct vehicle application.'' However, Connecticut argued that ``[e]nforcement
of Section 393.102 would be greatly enhanced if most common dimensions and strengths of steel strapping were added
to the tables of working load limits.'' The CVSA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The steel strap manufacturers have recently formed an association which is presently developing recommendations
on their products. Steel strapping is typically not used as the primary load securement device. Normally the strapping
will hold the cargo in bundles or to pallets while other devices are used to secure those bundles and pallets to the transporting
vehicle. Because steel strapping is not often used as a direct tiedown device and since the strap manufacturers are
now working through their association to develop strength and use guidelines, we recommend that this material not
be included in the proposed rule at this time. The new industry standards may well supersede the federal specification
referenced in the docket. Delaying action at this time could well reduce future confusion over regulatory requirements
for steel strapping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the incorporation by reference of rope standards, the Cordage Institute stated that ``[s]isal and nylon ropes
are not recommended [for cargo securement applications] and references to their standards [Sisal Rope Specifications
(SRS&hyph;1), Nylon Rope Specifications (NRS&hyph;1), and Double Braided Nylon Rope Specifications (C1)] should
be deleted.'' The Cordage Institute did not provide any information to support this recommendation and no other commenters
addressed this subject. It was recommended that the new standards for polypropylene fiber rope (PPRS&hyph;2, revised
August 1992) and polyester fiber rope (PETRS&hyph;2, revised January 1993) be used in place of P/PRS&hyph;1, May
1979 and PRS&hyph;1, May 1979, respectively. The Cordage Institute also provided clarification of its recommendations
on calculating working load limit values. Its policy on working load limit values has changed from using a specific
design factor for each size of cordage/rope to a design factor range. This approach leaves the selection of a specific
value to the particular applications for which the cordage will be used. For cargo securement applications involving
polypropylene and polyester fiber ropes, the Cordage Institute recommended a design factor of 6_the working load
limit would be equal to 1/6 of the minimum breaking strengths listed in PPRS&hyph;2 and PETRS&hyph;2. The Cordage
Institute recommended that the working load limits for manila rope be 1/2 that of the polypropylene fiber rope of the
same diameter. Working load limit values were also recommended for ``California Truck Rope''_rope meeting the requirements
of Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, &sect;1303(e). The Cordage Institute also suggested that the FHWA
include California's &sect;1303(e) requirements for synthetic fiber rope (e.g., rope shall be treated for ultraviolet
resistance, rope must have an orange surface marker in each rope strand, prohibition on the use of solid orange rope,
etc.).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to those commenters opposed to the incorporation by reference of certain manufacturing standards, the
FHWA notes that the intent of this process is to reduce the volume of material published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and Code of Federal Regulations by referencing relevant material published by the private sector. The legal effect
of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force and effect of law. Motor carriers do not need
to obtain copies of all of the materials which are incorporated by reference but only those that are relevant to their
specific circumstances (e.g., carriers relying solely upon steel chains do not need to obtain copies of standards
for steel strapping, cordage, webbing, or wire rope). Although there may be advantages to printing certain texts
from private sector documents in the regulations, the FHWA does not intend &sect;393.102 to be a technical reference
on manufacturing standards. Both the volume and complexity of the information covered in the referenced documents
is too great to be effectively presented in the FMCSRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the specific documents to be incorporated by reference, the final rule differs from the NPRM in that it does not
refer to Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880, Strapping, Steel Flat and Seals (May 13, 1980). Instead,
the final rule incorporates American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D3953&hyph;91, Standard Specification
for Strapping, Flat Steel and Seals. As the CVSA noted in its comments, steel strap manufacturers, working in conjunction
with the ASTM, are currently developing recommendations or guidelines concerning the use of steel strapping in load
securement. The FHWA has reviewed the preliminary strength and use guidelines that ASTM Subcommittee D10.14 provided
to the CVSA concerning breaking strengths and working load limits for steel strapping or banding. A copy of the preliminary
strength and use guidelines is included in the docket file. The working load limits are 1/4 of the breaking strengths
(the breaking strength multiplied by a design factor of 1/3 and a ``joint efficiency'' of 0.75) listed in ASTM D3953&hyph;91.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a review of ASTM D3953&hyph;91, the FHWA has determined that the preliminary strength and use guidelines of
ASTM Subcommittee D10.14 have merit and could, to some extent, be addressed in the final rule through the incorporation
by reference of ASTM D3953&hyph;91. The FHWA has compared the requirements of Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880
with those of ASTM D3953&hyph;91 and determined that the ASTM standard specification would serve as a better reference
for manufacturers and carriers to use in determining if certain sizes or grades of steel strapping are adequate for
cargo securement applications. Although the ASTM subcommittee (D10.14) is developing new guidelines, most of its
preliminary recommendations are based on ASTM D3953&hyph;91. Therefore, the FHWA believes that it is appropriate
to incorporate by reference the ASTM standard specification at this time, and consider the ASTM strength and use guidelines
for incorporation after they have been published.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for cordage specifications, the FHWA is incorporating by reference (1) CRS&hyph;1, Polyester/Polypropylene
Composite Rope Specifications, Three- and Eight-Strand Standard Construction, May 1979, (2) PPRS&hyph;2, Polypropylene
Fiber Rope, 3-Strand and 8-Strand Constructions, revised August 1992, (3) PETRS&hyph;2, Polyester Fiber Rope,
3-Strand and 8-Strand Constructions, revised January 1993, (4) NRS&hyph;1, Nylon Rope Specifications, Three-
and Eight-Strand Standard Construction, May 1979, and (5) C1, Double Braided Nylon Rope Specifications, DBN-January
1984. The incorporation of CRS&hyph;1, NRS&hyph;1 and C1 is consistent with the NPRM and the inclusion of PPRS&hyph;2
and PETRS&hyph;2 is in response to the docket comments. The FHWA has reviewed the Cordage Institute's recommendation
concerning the working load limits for manila rope (three-strand laid construction), and notes that the recommendation
results in (1) an increase in the working load limit for rope with diameters of 3/16 through 1/2 inch and 21/2 through
4 inches, and (2) a decrease in the working load limits for diameters of 9/16 through 21/4 inches. The increases in working
load limits are generally between 1 and 5 percent for the 21/2 through 4 inch diameter ropes. The percentage increases
in the working load limits of 3/16 through 1/2-inch rope are much larger. However, the safety factors provided in MRS&hyph;1
for 3/16 through 1/2-inch rope were greater than those of the larger diameter ropes. The FHWA believes the working
load limit recommendations of the Cordage Institute provide reasonable safety factors for manila rope. Accordingly,
the FHWA is adopting these recommendations as part of the table of working load limits in the final rule. In light of
the Cordage Institute's recommendations concerning manila rope working load limits, the FHWA does not believe that
it is appropriate to incorporate by reference MRS&hyph;1. To do so would result in a contradiction between the working
load limits contained in MRS&hyph;1 and the working load limits (for cargo securement applications) recommended
by the Cordage Institute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA accepts the Cordage Institute's suggestion to delete the reference to sisal rope (SRS&hyph;1), but does
not believe that excluding nylon rope specifications from the final rule is appropriate. The final rule is not intended
to incorporate standards for all tiedown materials, but only the most commonly used. In that context, and in consideration
of the relatively low working load limits for sisal rope the FHWA does not believe that including a specification for
sisal rope is essential. The FHWA notes that the rule does not prohibit the use of sisal rope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the nylon rope specifications, the references remain as originally proposed. Although the agency cannot quantify
the extent to which nylon rope is used, the working load limits for nylon rope are such that its usage in cargo securement
applications is likely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is not adopting the Cordage Institute's recommendation to include rope requirements similar to those used
in the California Code of Regulations. With the exception of California's requirement for ultraviolet resistance,
the FHWA considers this particular regulatory language unnecessarily design restrictive in that it would prohibit,
without sufficient technical justification, certain synthetic rope and webbing based primarily on material and/or
color, irrespective of its strength or safety for use in cargo securement. As for ultraviolet resistance requirements,
the Cordage Institute did not provide, and the California regulations do not include, sufficient information to
enable the FHWA to establish specific and objective regulatory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM requested comments on the method used in determining the working load limit for wire rope which is not marked.
Four commenters responded to this request. All supported the method described in the NPRM (i.e., 1/4 of the nominal
strength_the nominal strength multiplied by a design factor of 1/3 and the ``termination efficiency,'' 0.75). Therefore,
&sect;393.102(b) includes this method for determining the working load limit of unmarked wire rope.

Marking and Labeling of Tiedown Devices

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters responded to the FHWA's questions concerning the need for requiring the use of only those tiedown
devices which are marked or labeled with the working load limit. For example, the CVSA stated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of tiedowns have indicated that they are willing to mark load securement devices with working load
limit ratings. We believe having working load values marked on load securement devices is a significant aid to their
proper use and we would like to see such markings universally required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that presently, much of the tiedown equipment in the field is either unmarked or not directly marked with
working load limit. As it would be an extreme waste of resources and a huge financial burden on carriers to scrap today's
inventory of products not marked with working load limit, we would recommend the requirement for marking working
load limits be made effective at some future date, i.e., three to five years. Another way to handle this would be to grandfather
the tiedown equipment already manufactured and being used by the motor carrier industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York believed the final rule should ``clearly state that unmarked cargo securement devices, steel strapping,
chain, webbing, wire rope, etc. will not be allowed and will cause vehicles transporting materials with unmarked
devices to be placed out-of-service. There is no way to effectively ensure the adequacy of unmarked devices.''

The OOIDA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owner-operators frequently purchase tie-down hooks, chains, wire ropes, etc. at truck stops or other similar locations.
Drivers need to be assured that the items purchased meet all applicable safety standards. Therefore, the Agency should
take steps to require prominent displays on packaging that will ensure that the product meets safety requirements.
Specific details on packaging as to working load limit are preferable to general statements that manufacturing standards
are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FHWA is aware of the need for carriers and enforcement officials to be able to identify the various cargo securement
devices and the associated working load limits, the final rule does not include a requirement for marking and labeling
of these devices. Such a requirement must take into account manufacturers' practices as well as the need for uniformity.
The commenters did not provide any listings of current marking and labeling practices to assist the FHWA in determining
appropriate regulatory language. The agency cannot estimate what percentage of tiedown equipment currently in
use by motor carriers or stocked by manufacturers and retailers is unmarked or not directly marked with a working load
limit. Although a general requirement for the use of marked and labeled equipment could be included in &sect;393.102,
the absence of specific and objective guidelines as to what constitutes an acceptable mark or label for each type of
tiedown (i.e., chain, synthetic webbing, wire rope, steel strapping, cordage) would create enforcement difficulties.
The FHWA encourages tiedown manufacturers to develop uniform systems of marking and labeling their products to assist
motor carriers and enforcement officials in determining working load limits.

Applicability of Cargo Securement Regulations to Shippers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New York and the OOIDA expressed concern about the applicability of the cargo securement regulations to shippers.
Citing the catastrophic results of accidents caused by inadequate securement of steel and aluminum products, New
York believed the ``federal regulations should assign responsibility for proper cargo securement of steel and aluminum
products to both the shipper and the carrier.'' The OOIDA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large degree of responsibility for cargo securement lies squarely with the individual shipper. It is the shipper
who selects and ultimately contracts with various motor carriers to transport their commodities. Each shipper has
an obligation to scrutinize every prospective carrier and engage only those capable of providing the proper equipment
and expertise necessary to safely haul their specific product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA acknowledges these concerns. Whatever the merits of these arguments, however, the FHWA has no statutory
authority to regulate shippers of steel and aluminum products.

Future Rulemakings on Cargo Securement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters discussed the need for amending or clarifying numerous provisions of the cargo securement regulations
as well as the need for research. The Illinois Department of Transportation wrote: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois is concerned that application of the proposed aggregate working load limit formula may not provide adequate
margins of safety. What may be considered adequate securement for general freight may not be adequate for other loads.
The regulations identify unique securement standards for intermodal containers. Coils and metal articles also
have special securement requirements. Cargo weight and load configuration both need to be factored into the performance
standards expected from tiedown systems *&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential gravity and actual severity of incidents involving the transportation of metal coils, their frequency
of occurrence and the high number of apparent violations of the securement regulations give credibility to the need
to reevaluate the securement regulations. These concerns have led Illinois to sponsor a university research project
to examine the unique properties of metal coil cargo securement *&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will take 15 months and focus upon five areas: (1) Review and evaluate current systems, (2) examine the
volume of coils transported and the types of securement systems in use in Illinois, (3) evaluate the knowledge of persons
using or enforcing the securement regulations, (4) perform engineering dynamic studies to evaluate securement
systems, and (5) recommend improvements in securement systems and/or educational efforts for persons involved
in both the transportation and enforcement areas of the regulations. Upon its completion, the results and conclusion
of this project will be made available to FHWA and other parties interested in transportation safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research project will examine the dynamic forces affecting securement systems during normal driving and during
less than ideal transportation conditions such as hard braking, emergency maneuvers or sharp radius turns. Illinois'
data indicates loss of cargo commonly occurs during these less than ideal conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA welcomes efforts by academia, tiedown and vehicle manufacturers, motor carriers, and others conducting
research or studies directed at reducing the incidence of cargo securement-related accidents. Currently the FHWA
is working with the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators, State and Provincial agencies responsible
for motor carrier safety activities, and U.S. and Canadian industry groups to conduct a comprehensive research program
on cargo securement. A report identifying certain cargo securement issues needing research and describing a program
to address them was published by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation in November 1993. A copy of the report entitled
``A Proposal for Research to Provide a Technical Basis for a Revised National Standard on Load Security for Heavy Trucks''
is included in the docket file. It is expected that this research, along with efforts such as those described by Illinois,
will contribute greatly toward evaluating current cargo securement regulations and industry practices and providing
recommendations for specific actions needed to improve safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is not intended to preclude consideration of future rulemakings on cargo securement.

Discussion of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA is amending &sect;393.102(b) to require that the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies
used to secure an article against movement in any direction be at least 1/2 the weight of the article secured. Steel
strapping, chain, synthetic webbing, wire rope, and cordage used must meet certain manufacturing or performance
standards which are incorporated by reference. The incorporation of these standards is intended to specify minimum
requirements for tiedowns and not to restrict the use of tiedowns which exceed the criteria contained therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 393.7, which was proposed in its entirety in the NPRM, was created by the final rule entitled ``Parts and Accessories
Necessary for Safe Operation; Warning Devices for Stopped Vehicles'' (RIN 2125&hyph;AD17; FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;19),
which is published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FHWA is amending &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language of incorporation required
by 1 CFR 51 and to provide information on the availability of the incorporated documents. After a review of the responses
to the September 17, 1993, NPRM and a determination that the incorporation by reference was necessary for the final
rule, the FHWA submitted the documents listed in &sect;393.102(b)(1) to (b)(5) to the Director of the Federal Register
for approval in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 51. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule does not require tiedowns to be marked or labeled. However, manufacturers of tiedowns and associated
equipment are encouraged to provide motor carriers and enforcement officials with a means to easily determine the
working load limits of their products. For those cases in which the tiedown manufacturing standards (incorporated
by reference into the final rule) include guidelines for marking and labeling, adherence to those guidelines is encouraged,
but is not mandated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 393.102(b) is amended to include a table of working load limits for common types and sizes of tiedown devices.
The working load limits listed in the table are to be used when the tiedown material is not marked by the manufacturer
with the working load limit. Tiedown materials marked by the manufacturer with working load limits which differ from
the table, shall be considered to have a working load limit equal to the value for which they are marked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the working load limits for cordage, the table lists values for manila, polypropylene, polyester,
and nylon cordage. For those cases in which the a synthetic rope does not have a manufacturers' marking or label to enable
motor carriers and enforcement officials to distinguish between polypropylene, polyester fiber ropes, polyester/polypropylene
composite rope, or nylon rope, the working load limits of polypropylene fiber rope shall be used. Since polypropylene
fiber rope generally has a lower working load limit than polyester and nylon ropes, this provision is important to
ensure safety. The agency notes that the working load limits for nylon rope are based on the specific design factors
in the nylon rope specifications, NRS&hyph;1 and C1. These design factors are between 9 and 12 for three- and eight-strand
standard construction nylon rope and between 7 and 11 for double braided nylon rope. As a result, the working load limits
shown in &sect;393.102 for certain sizes of nylon rope are lower than that for polypropylene fiber rope. Considering
the Cordage Institute's recommendation for a design factor of 6 for polypropylene fiber rope and polyester rope,
the FHWA believes that the use of polypropylene fiber rope working load limits is appropriate in those cases in which
the rope cannot be identified as nylon. The table of working load limits does not include information on polyester/polypropylene
composite rope because the working load limit values are generally very close, if not identical, to those of polypropylene
fiber rope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of steel strapping, wire rope, and cordage, the final rule includes a procedure for calculating the working
load limits. The published industry standards for these materials use breaking strengths, nominal strengths, and
working load limit ranges respectively. To ensure consistency in calculating the working load limits and an appropriate
safety margin in determining the number of tiedown devices required, these procedures must be used when the working
load limit is not provided by the manufacturer or when the manufacturer provides working load limit ranges for cargo
securement applications.

This final rule amends the requirements for the strength ratings for cargo securement devices. The FHWA has determined
that this is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within
the meaning of the Department of Transportation policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact
of this rulemaking will be minimal. The final rule requires that the aggregate working load limits of the tiedown assemblies
used to secure cargo be at least 1/2 times the weight of the article being secured. The total number of tiedown assemblies
required by the rule would generally be the same as or slightly more than the number required using the previous breaking
strength terminology. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal. Therefore,
a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the agency has evaluated the effects
of this rulemaking on small entities. As previously stated, the final rule amends &sect;393.102(b) of the Federal
Motor Carrier Safety Regulations by requiring that the aggregate working load limits of the tiedown assemblies used
to secure cargo be at least 1/2 times the weight of the article being secured. The total number of tiedown assemblies
required by the rule would generally be the same as or slightly more than the number required prior to this amendment.
Based on the evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 27, 1992, OMB published a proposed version of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (57 FR 39018). OMB received over 200
comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations, and others. After considering
all comments, OMB published the circular in final form on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary revises Parts 74 (Administration of Grants) and 77 (Definitions that Apply to Department Regulations)
of EDGAR to incorporate the revised Circular. The Secretary has deviated from the text of the Circular to make certain
technical changes. In addition, the Secretary has made two substantive changes to the text of the Circular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 412 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA)(20 U.S.C. 3472) provides that the Secretary may
delegate the functions of the Department only to officers and employees of the Department. Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 .4 of the Circular, however, has the effect of delegating one of the Secretary's functions_granting exceptions to
the regulations as promulgated by the Secretary for Department programs_to employees of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB). In order to avoid this conflict with the DEOA, the Secretary is deviating from the text of the Circular
to authorize the Secretary to grant exceptions to the regulations after consultation with appropriate officials
of OMB.

Section 437(a) of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) (20 U.S.C. 1232f) requires that records be retained

.53(b) of the Circular, as established by OMB, however, requires recipients to retain financial records, supporting
documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the award for a period of three years. The Secretary
has changed this requirement in &sect;74.53(b) of the regulations to require recipients to retain records for five
years in accordance with GEPA.

The revised Circular A&hyph;110 as implemented in 34 CFR Parts 74 and 77 of the Education Department General Administrative
Regulations (EDGAR) (1) harmonize the regulations with numerous and significant changes in grant administrative
practice and legislation since the original Circular was issued in 1976; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) bring the requirements for institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations
closer to those contained for State, local, and tribal governments in OMB Circular A&hyph;102 (implemented by the
Department at 34 CFR Part 80) so that the Department's grant administration is more uniform across classes of recipients;
(3) reduce regulatory burden on and give greater flexibility to recipients in numerous cases; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) strengthen certain provisions in order to protect the Federal interest. The Circular, as implemented in these

In some cases, the regulatory language in these sections represent changes in policy or procedure in the administration

administrative policy or procedures of the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the Secretary waives rulemaking on these regulations under section
553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (20 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)). This section provides that rulemaking is not
required when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or
contrary to the public interest. The Secretary believes further public comment on the technical changes made to the
Circular is unnecessary because the substance of these provisions has already been subjected to public comment during
OMB's solicitation of public comment. The Secretary also believes that further public comment on the substantive
changes to the Circular is unnecessary because these changes incorporate statutory requirements that the Secretary
is not authorized to change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Department's programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens, specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on these
small institutions because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary
Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program
funds.

 In each instance, the Secretary decides on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement,
or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301&hyph;08) governs the use of grants,
cooperative agreements, and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose
of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory
criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, substantial involvement
is expected between ED and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement. Contracts
shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the
Federal Government.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the
metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. The Secretary follows the provisions of E.O. 12770_Metric
Usage in Federal Government Programs.

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State
agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section
6002 of the RCRA. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific
products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) (40 CFR Parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly, recipients that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal
funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products
pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

accordance with the reporting requirements established in &sect;74.52. If the Secretary requires reporting on
an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not
be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop accrual data for its reports
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income, and interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR Part 205_Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability, and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Secretary
may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed
adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Secretary may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect
the Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the bonds shall be obtained from companies

and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR Part 205.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in
&sect;74.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization are limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The timing and amount of cash advances are as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements
by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Whenever possible, advances are consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check, and electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR Part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic
fund transfers are not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement_or
other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the
recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by ED instructions for
electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. The
Secretary may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project
is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor
portion of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Secretary makes payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing,
unless the billing is improper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers
are not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Secretary has determined that reimbursement
is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Secretary may provide cash on a working
capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Secretary advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated
disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Secretary
reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment is not
used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's
actual cash disbursements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned
on these funds before requesting additional cash payments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, the Secretary does not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients
at any time during the project period unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129_Managing
Federal Credit Programs. Under these conditions, the Secretary may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that ED does not make payments for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the Secretary does not require separate
depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories
for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation, and expenditure
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative
expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject
to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the
Secretary, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms are authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. The Secretary does not require more than an original and two copies of the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The Secretary adopts the SF&hyph;270 as a standard form for
all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. The
Secretary may, however, use this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271_Outlay Report and Request
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;271_Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Secretary adopts the
SF&hyph;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, the
Secretary may substitute the SF&hyph;270 when the Secretary determines that it provides adequate information to
meet Federal needs.

for cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If the Secretary authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities
acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the
lesser of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time
of donation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current fair market value. However, if there is sufficient justification, the Secretary may approve the use
of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation
to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates must be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings, and land for which
title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Secretary has approved the charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings may not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment may not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at
the time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period must be retained

or more of the following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary prescribes requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired
in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the minimum requirements provide the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property must vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Secretary for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored
projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project.
Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) that have purposes
consistent with those authorized for support by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from ED or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Secretary observes one or
more of the following disposition instructions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Secretary and pay the Federal
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation
in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds).
When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established that
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party. The recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value
of the property.

or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Secretary for further ED utilization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If ED has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless the Secretary has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority
provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational
and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821_Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support

without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.
This property is ``exempt property.'' Should the Secretary not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon
acquisition vests in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

(b) The recipient may not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations
for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal
statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and may not encumber the property without approval
of the Secretary. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment
in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project; and then
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program
for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other projects or
programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given
to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal
awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A description of the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment
(not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Unit acquisition cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current
fair market value where a recipient compensates ED for its share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government must be identified to indicate Federal ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A physical inventory of equipment must be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records must be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A control system must be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures must be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures must be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment
for other uses provided that compensation is made to ED or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed
by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair
market value of the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the
Secretary. The Secretary shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet ED requirements. If no requirement
exists within ED, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the
Secretary to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Secretary issues
instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures
govern:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse ED an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall
be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for
the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient is reimbursed by ED by an amount
which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project
or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs
incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient is reimbursed by ED for costs
incurred in its disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Secretary may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by
the Federal Government when the third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. This transfer shall be
subject to the following standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The equipment must be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Secretary issues disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The
final inventory must list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Secretary
does not issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards
of this section, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the Secretary exercises the right to take title, the equipment is subject to the provisions for federally-owned
equipment.

or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 74.41 through 74.48 contain standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property, and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are designed to ensure that these materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. The Secretary does not impose additional
procurement standards or requirements upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or as authorized in &sect;&sect;74.4 or 74.14.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Secretary, regarding
the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered
into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation,
or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to Federal, State
or local authority that may have proper jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
A conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner,
or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other
interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit
nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However,
recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited
item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations
of these standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall
be excluded from competing for procurements. Awards must be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive
to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations
shall clearly establish all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) The specific features of brand name or equal descriptions that bidders are required to meet when these items are
included in the solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment, and are energy efficient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of organizations such as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but must be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting must not be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts are made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration is given to matters as contractor integrity,
record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In
certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by E.O. 12549 (implemented by the Secretary
in 34 CFR Part 85) and E.O. 12689_Debarment and Suspension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Secretary, pre-award review and procurement documents,
such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following
conditions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some form of cost or price analysis must be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability, and allowability.

A system for contract administration must be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions

Contract provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions must also be applied to subcontracts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for remedial actions as may be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
contracts must describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default, as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements must provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Secretary may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the
recipient, provided the Secretary has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately
protected. If a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' must consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute contractual documents as may be required within the time
specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under a contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where bonds are required, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable
sureties pursuant to 31 CFR Part 223_Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients must
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, ED, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, must have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors must contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function, or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
in &sect;74.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary prescribes the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided
in &sect;74.51(f), performance reports are not required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than
annually. Annual reports are due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports are due 30
days after the reporting period. The Secretary may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple
year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration
or termination of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report is not required after completion of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When required, performance reports must generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
this quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients are not required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Secretary of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification must be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification must include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Secretary may make site visits, as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The following forms or other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A_Financial Status Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Recipients are required to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction
projects or programs. The Secretary may not require the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when, the Secretary determines
that SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272_Report of Federal Cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transactions_provides adequate information to meet the Department's needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or
SF&hyph;269A is required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary prescribes whether the report is on a cash or accrual basis. If the Secretary requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient is not required to
convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis
of the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Secretary determines the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering
the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report is not required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report is required at the completion of the agreement.

(iv) The Secretary requires recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two
copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports,
and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Secretary
upon request of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Secretary requires each recipient to submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when
necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. The Secretary uses this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients
and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, the Secretary may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section
the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. The Secretary may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving
advances totaling $1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Secretary may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that advances are monitored through other
forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in the Secretary's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal
advances; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When the Secretary needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, the Secretary shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the Secretary determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in &sect;74.21,
additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient
until the system is brought up to standard. The Secretary, in obtaining this information, complies with the report
clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary may shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Secretary may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer
printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Secretary may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when these outputs expedite or contribute
to the accuracy of reporting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of five years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Secretary requests transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the
records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, the Secretary may
make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Secretary, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized
representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records
of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts, and
copies of documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose
of interview and discussion related to these documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the
required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, the Secretary does not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access
to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Secretary can demonstrate that the records
must be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to ED. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The starting date for retention of the following types of documents (including supporting records) is specified
in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section: indirect cost rate computations or proposals; cost allocation plans;
and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer
usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If submitted for negotiation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the recipient submits to the Secretary or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other
computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 5-year retention period for its supporting records
starts on the date of submission.

Effects of suspension and termination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless the Secretary expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination
or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably
avoidable are allowable if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.

to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular
component of the entity is designated in the award document. For example, a grant award document may name as the grantee
one school or campus of a university. In this case, the granting agency usually intends, or actually intends, that
the named component assume primary or sole responsibility for administering the grant-assisted project or program.
Nevertheless, the naming of a component of a legal entity as the grantee in a grant award document shall not be construed
as relieving the whole legal entity from accountability to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided.
(This definition is not intended to affect the eligibility provision of grant programs in which eligibility is limited
to organizations which may be only components of a legal entity.) The term ``grantee'' does not include any secondary
recipients such as subgrantees, contractors, etc., who may receive funds from a grantee pursuant to a grant. The definition
of ``grantee'' for State, local, and tribal governments is contained in 34 CFR 80.3.

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is revising and reorganizing its regulations on Smoking/No Smoking Areas.
As revised, designated smoking areas at the Bureau's medical referral centers and minimum security institutions
ordinarily shall be outside of buildings and away from entrances. Wardens at all low, medium, high, and administrative
institutions other than medical referral centers may continue, but are not required, to designate indoor smoking
areas in addition to outdoor smoking areas. Additional provisions have been revised or reorganized for the sake of
clarity or to avoid redundancy. This amendment is intended to provide for a clean air environment and to protect the
health and safety of staff and inmates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Smoking/No Smoking Areas. A final rule on this subject was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 16, 1989 (54 FR 47753). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 8, 1994, the Bureau of Prisons published a proposed rule requiring that ``smoking areas'' to be designated
by Wardens at medical referral centers and at minimum security institutions shall ordinarily be outside of all buildings
and away from all entrances so as not to expose others to second-hand smoke. As for the remaining Bureau institutions,
the proposed rule specifies that the Warden may, but is not required to, designate indoor smoking areas in addition
to outdoor smoking areas. The proposed rule also reorganized and revised the regulations for the sake of clarity and
to avoid redundancy. For example, the regulations had contained cross references qualifying those locations where
smoking ordinarily was not permitted. Because the Warden is responsible for designating smoking areas, ordinarily
only where the needs of effective operations so require, the Bureau deems it unnecessary to list in its revised regulations
specific locations which would still be subject to the Warden's discretion. The listing of these locations has therefore
been removed from the regulation, but remains as guidance in implementing instructions to staff. The revised regulations
also contain a nomenclature change in which the title ``Warden'' has been substituted for ``Chief Executive Officer''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period closed on April 11, 1994. The Bureau received comments from only one respondent. The commenter,
a public health interest group, stated that it supported the proposal and believed it to be an important health measure.
The commenter further recommended that in the cases in which the Warden decides to designate an indoor smoking area,
the area should be separately ventilated so that the air is vented directly to the outside and does not mix with the air
circulating in other parts of the facility. Finally, the commenter stated that it believed it essential that smoking
cessation services for employees and inmates be made available as part of a policy for a smokefree environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Bureau wishes to note that guidance on ventilation requirements for indoor smoking
areas is provided in its internal instructions to staff. Given the limited number of indoor smoking areas which may
be authorized under &sect;551.163(b) and the constraints of operations in a correctional setting, the Bureau believes
it unnecessary to include more specific direction in its regulations. The Bureau also wishes to note that separate
policy on the provisioning of wellness programs to staff and to inmates does allow for participation in smoking cessation
programs. While budget and staff limitations initially may limit such staff and inmate participation to those institutions
most affected by the revised regulations, the Bureau is committed to extending program opportunities at all facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in light of the above comment and agency response, the Bureau is adopting the proposed amendments as a final
rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Endstrom
Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, 280, and 280C series helicopters, that currently requires
an initial and repetitive visual inspections of the upper swashplate bearings for corrosion, and replacement of
defective upper swashplate bearings with airworthy bearings. This action would require that the visual inspections
apply to both the upper and lower swashplate bearings (bearings); expand the applicability to those affected helicopters
manufactured prior to January 1, 1981; establish a retirement life of 1,200 hours' time-in-service for certain bearings;
and provide a corrected upper swashplate bearing part number. This proposal is prompted by the necessity to require
visual inspection so the lower swashplate bearings; expand the applicability to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2
helicopter; establish a retirement life for certain bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing part number
from the existing AD. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 19, 1976, the FAA issued AD 76&hyph;01&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;2560, (41 FR 13906, April 1, 1976), to
require an initial and repetitive visual inspection of the upper swashplate bearing, part number (P/N) Z993L13XR3B,
for corrosion, and replacement of corroded upper swashplate bearings. That action was prompted by three reports
of upper swashplate bearing failures that were attributed to corrosion. These failures occurred between 205 and
586 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In two of these incidents, the probable cause of the upper swashplate bearing failures
was corrosion of the balls and race due to water impregnating the housing after the loss of lubricant. This led to a spalling
interaction between the balls and race, resulting in upper swashplate bearing failure. After reviewing the data,
the FAA has determined that corrosion of either upper or lower bearings (bearings) could create an unsafe condition.
These conditions, if not corrected, could result in failure of the bearings and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, improved and modified bearings have been approved by the FAA for these model helicopters.
Additionally, the manufacturer has issued The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter (SIL)
No. 0110, Revision B, dated March 18, 1993, that extends the previous visual inspections to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2
helicopters. The SIL describes an approved swashplate modification and indicates that the SIL should only apply
to those affected helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. In addition, a swashplate modification that
would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this AD has been approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 76&hyph;06&hyph;11 to require visual inspections of the lower swashplate
bearings; expand the applicability to the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopter; establish a retirement life of 1,200
hours' time-in-service for certain upper and lower swashplate bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing
part number in the existing AD. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action from the requirements
of this AD and limit the applicability of the AD requirements to those affected model helicopters manufactured prior
to January 1, 1981.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 660 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $1,400 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,105,500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Springdale, AR. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower
is closed to contain IFR operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace, during the hours that the control tower is closed, for IFR operations at Springdale Regional Airport,
Springdale, Arkansas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 958 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the rulemaking record for the proposed revision
of the regulation of personal protective equipment for shipyard employment (53 FR 48150, November 29, 1988) to incorporate
the rulemaking record developed for the recently revised regulation of personal protective equipment for general
industry (Docket S&hyph;060, final rule published in 59 FR 16334, April 6, 1994) and the record for the proposed regulation
of personal protective equipment (fall protection equipment for general industry) (Docket S&hyph;057, 55 FR 13423,
April 10, 1990). While the shipyard rulemaking on personal protective equipment (PPE) generated 10 comments, the
general industry rulemakings generated hundreds of comments and several thousand pages of hearing testimony regarding
PPE issues. The Agency believes the regulation of PPE in shipyard and general industry employment should be consistent,
in order to facilitate compliance and effective employee protection. OSHA has determined that the information in
Dockets S&hyph;060 and S&hyph;057 is relevant to full consideration of the issues raised by the shipyard PPE proposal,
and that it is appropriate to reopen the record to incorporate those materials and to allow the public an opportunity
to comment. This notice also raises specific PPE issues arising out of the general industry rulemakings for public
comment.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard
employment standards (part 1915, subpart I) (53 FR 48150). The proposal updated references to national consensus
standards and added requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection and care of PPE, training, lifesaving
equipment and personal fall protection equipment. The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency
received 10 comments on the proposed rule. There were no hearing requests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket
S&hyph;060) for eye and face (&sect;1910.133), head (&sect;1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic
requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training
in the proper use of PPE (&sect;&sect;1910.132 (d) through (f)) (54 FR 33832). The proposed general industry revisions
were consistent with the corresponding provisions of the proposed rule for shipyard employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128,
1910.129 and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry
PPE standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;057) (55 FR 13423). Again, the criteria proposed for general industry
PPE were consistent with those proposed for shipyards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive records, including hundreds of comments and several thousand
pages of hearing testimony. On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in
the Docket S&hyph;060 proceeding. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting
the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirement so that it provides clear direction
regarding what constitutes adequate training and what circumstances trigger a requirement for retraining. In addition,
the final rule added requirements for the certification of the hazard assessment (&sect;1910.132(d)(2)) and certification
that the required training has been provided and understood (&sect;1910.132(f)(4)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, based on the rulemaking record for general industry fall protection PPE (Docket S&hyph;057), the Agency is
considering further limiting or prohibiting the use of body belts and non-locking snaphooks in personal fall arrest
systems. In particular, the evidence in the record supports the conclusion that an employee who falls while wearing
a body belt as part of a personal fall arrest system is substantially more likely to suffer death or serious injury than
would be the case if the employee were wearing a full body harness. Furthermore, the rulemaking record indicates that
locking snaphooks designed to prevent ``roll out'' (where snaphooks become accidentally disengaged during use)
provide a higher level of employee protection than single-action (non-locking) snaphooks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is appropriate to facilitate employer access to safety and health standards by maintaining separate standards
for general industry (part 1910) and for the shipyard industry (part 1915), the Agency believes that the substance
of those standards should be consistent. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent rulemaking records,
that PPE used in shipyards does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry. Therefore, the Agency has determined
that the information generated in the general industry rulemakings should be taken into account as the Agency drafts
the final rule for shipyard PPE, as well. To this end, OSHA is incorporating the general industry PPE rulemaking records
(Dockets S&hyph;057 and S&hyph;060) into the record for the shipyards PPE rulemaking. In addition, OSHA is reopening
the written comment period for the shipyard PPE proposal so the public has an opportunity to comment on the newly incorporated
materials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is requesting comments on these five specific issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of hazard assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information
needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The
Agency believes that employers are able to determine and evaluate the hazards of their particular workplaces and
to use this information for proper PPE selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;1915.152(b) required employers to select the types of PPE to be used by employees based on an assessment
of the workplace hazards relative to PPE. The comments on proposed &sect;1910.132(d), which contained identical
language, indicated concern about the level of documentation required for hazards assessment (Exs. 3:1 and 3:68).
In regard to the general industry rulemaking, OSHA concluded that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance
officers and affected employees with appropriate assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed.
Given the performance-oriented nature of the rule, the Agency determined that the generation and review of extensive
documentation would be unnecessarily burdensome.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has addressed such situations in other rulemakings (e.g., permit-required confined spaces, &sect;1910.146(g)(4);
and the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout), 1910.147(c)(7)(iv) by requiring employers to verify their
compliance with a requirement through a written certification. The Agency has found that a written certification
is a reasonable means by which to establish accountability for compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, OSHA determined that an employer could adequately verify compliance with the hazard assessment requirement
through a written certification which identified the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the hazard
assessment had been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identified the document as a certification
of hazard assessment. Accordingly, the Agency added this requirement to the final rule as &sect;1910.132(d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that verification through written certification would also be appropriate with regard to hazard assessments
to be performed under proposed &sect;1915.152(b). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information,
as to the need for certification of the hazard assessment and the anticipated impact of such a requirement on the shipyard
industry.

2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed &sect;1915.152(e) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. Proposed &sect;1910.132(f)
contained an identical requirement. Based on comments received in relation to proposed &sect;1910.132(f) (Exs.
3:41, 3:46, 3:49, 3:62 and 3:129) which expressed concern regarding the level of documentation employers would be
required to provide for their training efforts, OSHA raised Issue 4 in the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990)
to elicit additional information on the recordkeeping needed to document compliance with the proposed paragraph.
The commenters (Exs. 7:8, 7:19 and 7:39) generally supported some sort of certification for completion of training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record and the considerations raised above in regard to Reopening Issue 1, OSHA determined
that employers could adequately verify compliance with proposed &sect;1910.132(f) through a written certification.
Accordingly, the Agency revised proposed paragraph (f) to add paragraph (f)(4), which requires a certification
record that identifies each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification
of training in the use of PPE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that verification through written certification would also be appropriate with regard to training
to be provided under proposed &sect;1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information,
as to the need for certification of employee training and the anticipated impact of such a requirement on the shipyard
industry.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As mentioned above, proposed &sect;1915.152(e) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE,
and proposed &sect;1910.132(f) set forth an identical requirement. Based on comments and testimony received in
relation to proposed &sect;1910.132(f) (Exs. 3:36, 3:41, 3:50, 3:60, 3:73, 3:86, 3:88, 3:116, 3:128; 7:3, 7:8, 7:11,
7:20, 7:29, 7:38; Tr. 23:24; 4/3, Tr. 272&hyph;286; 4/4) which expressed concern that the proposed language did not
provide enough detailed guidance regarding what constituted adequate training, OSHA determined that more specific
guidance should be provided by the final requirement. Accordingly, the Agency determined that more specific guidance
was appropriate and revised proposed &sect;1910.132(f) to require, at a minimum, training in the following areas:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What PPE is necessary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The limitations of the PPE; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, many of the above comments and testimony suggested that in order to have a successful training program,
employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees demonstrate that they have reached
those objectives. Also, it was suggested that retraining be provided, when the employer determined that employees
may not possess sufficient knowledge about the PPE. Accordingly, the following provisions were added to &sect;1910.132(f)
in the final rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, and the ability to use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the
understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee.
Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained
the requisite understanding or skill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that these more specific training requirements would also be appropriate with regard to training provided
under &sect;1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, as to the need for such
requirements and the anticipated impact of those requirements on the shipyard industry.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Body belts and harnesses in fall arrest systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;1910.129(b) provided the system performance criteria for personal fall arrest systems. In particular,
the proposed paragraph limited maximum arresting force on an employee to 900 pounds (4 kN) when using a body belt and
1,800 pounds (8 kN) when using a body harness. The corresponding provision for shipyard employment, proposed &sect;1915.159(a)(4)(iii),
limited maximum arresting force for either belts or harnesses to the lesser of 10 times the employee's weight, or 1,800
pounds (8 kN). The more protective criteria in proposed &sect;1910.129(b) are based on information obtained after
the Shipyard PPE proposal was issued (53 FR 48150, Nov. 29, 1988). This information is discussed in the General Industry
PPE proposal (55 FR 13423, April 10, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and testimony received on proposed &sect;1910.129(b) (Exs. 3:22, 3:31; Tr. 240&hyph;241 and 1374) indicate
that the Agency needs to reconsider allowing the use of body belts in fall arrest systems. OSHA solicits comments,
with supporting information regarding whether or not body belts should be permitted for use in fall arrest systems,
and the anticipated impact on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might limit or prohibit their use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Locking and non-locking snap hooks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;1915.159 (a)(15), (a)(16), and (a)(17) prohibited certain snap hook connections (such as, connecting
snap hooks to each other) where snap hooks have been known to accidentally disengage, allowing an employee to fall.
Proposed &sect;1910.129(c)(1) required that snap hooks, unless of the locking type, and designed for certain connections
(such as to each other, to horizontal lifelines, or to incompatibly shaped objects), not be used for these connections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and testimony received on the general industry provisions (Exs. 3:9, 3:12, 3:19; Tr. 210) has led the Agency
to consider a prohibition on the use of non-locking snap hooks in personal fall protection systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, regarding whether or not non-locking snap hooks should be
permitted for use in personal fall protection systems or in positioning device systems, and the anticipated impact
on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might further limit or prohibit their use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to sections 4, 11 and 17 of the National School Lunch Act (NSLA) (42 U.S.C. 1753, 1759a and 1766), section 4
of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) and &sect;&sect;226.4, 226.12 and 226.13 of the regulations governing
the CACFP (7 CFR part 226), notice is hereby given of the new payment rates for participating institutions. These rates
shall be in effect during the period July 1, 1994&hyph;June 30, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided for under the NSLA and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, all rates in the CACFP must be prescribed annually
on July 1 to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for the most recent 12-month period. In accordance with this
mandate, the Department last published the adjusted national average payment rates for centers, the food service
payment rates for day care homes and the administrative reimbursement rates for sponsors of day care homes on July

percent increase during the 12-month period May 1993 to May 1994 (from 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994) in the food
away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other foods provided to States during the past school year met the level of

These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under Nos. 10.550, 10.555, and 10.558 and
are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice implements mandatory provisions of sections 6(e), 14(f) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1755(e), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)). Section 6(e)(1)(A) of the Act establishes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national average value of donated food assistance to be given to States for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each lunch served in NSLP at 11.00 cents per meal. Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e)(1)(B), this amount is subject to annual adjustments as of July 1 of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions. Section 17(h)(1) of the Act provides that the same value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance in donated foods for school lunches shall also be established for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lunches and suppers served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is hereby given that the national average minimum value of donated foods, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cash in lieu thereof, per lunch under NSLP (7 CFR part 210) and per lunch and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supper under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14.50 cents for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions is computed on the basis of five major food components in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy products; processed fruits and vegetables; and fats and oils). Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component is assigned a proportional value using the appropriate relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The value of food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance is adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a three- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month simple average value of this Price Index for March, April and May. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-month average of the Price Index increased by 2.92 percent from 123.23 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for March, April and May of 1993 to 126.83 for the same three months in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When computed on the basis of unrounded data and rounded to the nearest one-quarter cent, the resulting national average
for the period July 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through June 30, 1995 will be 14.50 cents per meal. This is an increase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.50 cents from the school year 1994 rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 14(f) of the Act provides that commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated foods equal in value
to the sum of the national average value

of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and the national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average payment established under section 4 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1753). Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools are eligible to receive up to 5 cents of this value in cash for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing and handling expenses related to the use of such foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commodity schools are defined in section 12(d)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1760(d)(7)) as ``schools that do not participate in the school lunch program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this Act, but which receive commodities made available by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use by such schools in nonprofit lunch programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1995 school year, commodity schools shall be eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated food assistance valued at 31.50 cents for each lunch served. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount is based on the sum of the section 6(e) level of assistance announced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this notice and the adjusted section 4 minimum national average payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor for school year 1995. The section 4 factor for commodity schools does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include the two cents per lunch increase for schools where 60 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lunches were served in the second preceding year free or at reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices, since that increase is applicable only to schools participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National School Lunch Program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1755(b)) and the regulations governing cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lieu of donated foods (7 CFR part 240) require the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by June 1 of each school year to estimate the value of agricultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities and other foods that will be delivered to States during that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school year. Under the food distribution regulations (7 CFR part 250), these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods are used by schools participating in NSLP. If the estimated value is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the total level of commodity assistance authorized under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e) of the Act, the Secretary is required by July 1 of that school year to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay to each State educational agency funds equal to the difference between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of programmed deliveries and the total level of authorized assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past school year the adjusted minimum national average value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated foods or payments of cash in lieu thereof per lunch was 14.00 cents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 6(e) of the Act, the mandated level of commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance was $566,188,578 for school year 1994. The Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that at least that amount was available for delivery nationally by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994 to meet the mandated level of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given, therefore, that no shortfall cash payments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made for the school year ending June 30, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice announces the annual adjustments to: (1) The ``national average payments,'' the amount of money the Federal
Government provides States for lunches and breakfasts served to children participating in the National School Lunch
and School Breakfast Programs; (2) the ``maximum reimbursement rates,'' the maximum per lunch rate from Federal
funds that a State can provide a school food authority for lunches served to children participating in the National
School Lunch Program; and (3) the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school
or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program for Children. The payments and rates are prescribed
on an annual basis each July. The annual payments and rates adjustments for the school lunch and school breakfast programs
reflect changes in the Food Away From Home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The annual rate
adjustment for milk reflects changes in the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products. These payments and rates
are in effect from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.

Special Milk Program for Children
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Pursuant to section 3 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1772), the Department announces the
rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school or institution which participates
in the Special Milk Program for Children. This rate is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index
for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the period July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995, the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to a nonneedy child
in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program is 11.00 cents. This reflects no change over
the current reimbursement rate because the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231) from May 1993
to May 1994 (from a level of 120.6 in May 1993 to 121.1 in May 1994) did not change significantly enough to trigger a change
in the reimbursement rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a reminder, schools or institutions with pricing programs which elect to serve milk free to eligible children continue
to receive the average cost of a half-pint of milk (the total cost of all milk purchased during the claim period divided
by the total number of purchased half-pints) for each half-pint served to an eligible child.

_Pursuant to section 11 of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1759a), and section 4 of the Child Nutrition
Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1773), the Department annually announces the adjustments to the National Average
Payment Factors and to the maximum Federal reimbursement rates for meals served to children participating in the
National School Lunch Program. Adjustments are prescribed each July 1, based on changes in the Food Away From Home
series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department
of Labor. The changes in the national average payment rates for schools and residential child care institutions for
the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995 reflect a 1.7 percent increase in the Price Index during the 12-month period
May 1993 to May 1994 (from a level of 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994).

Lunch Payment Factors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Section 4 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753) provides general cash for food assistance payments to
States to assist schools in purchasing food. There are two section 4 National Average Payment Factors for lunches
served under the National School Lunch Program. The lower payment factor applies to lunches served by school food
authorities in which less than 60 percent of the lunches served in the school lunch program during the second preceding
school year were served free or at a reduced price. The higher payment factor applies to lunches served by school food
authorities in which 60 percent or more of the lunches served during the second preceding school year were served free
or at a reduced price. To supplement these section 4 payments, section 11 of the National School Lunch Act provides
special cash assistance payments to aid schools in providing free and reduced-price lunches. The section 11 National
Average Payment Factor for each reduced-price lunch served is set at 40 cents less than the factor for each free lunch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As authorized under sections 8 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act, maximum reimbursement rates for each type of
lunch are prescribed by the Department in this Notice. These maximum rates ensure equitable disbursement of Federal
funds to school food authorities.

_Section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 establishes National Average Payment Factors for free, reduced-price
and paid breakfasts served under the School Breakfast Program and additional payments for schools determined to
be in ``severe need'' because they serve a high percentage of needy children.

The following specific section 4 and section 11 National Average Payment Factors and maximum reimbursement rates

for Alaska and Hawaii are higher than those for all other States. The District of Columbia, Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico and the Pacific Territories use the figures specified for the contiguous States.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 24, 1991 a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Boulder tony Timber Sale
and Other Projects on the Siuslaw National Forest was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 33903). Because of new direction in the President's Forest Plan, the proposed project is no longer consistent
with Forest management objectives. The Forest Service has decided to terminate the environmental analysis for this
EIS. There will be no draft or final EIS for the Boulder Tony timber sale and other projects.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicated that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Donald W. Gohmert, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project purposes are reduced interior marsh losses and shoreline erosion. The planned works of improvement include
eight fixed crest weirs with boat bays, three canal plugs with flapgated culverts, seven canal plugs, four earthen
overflow banks (a total of 30,730 feet), and two rock overflow banks (a total of 5,338 feet).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
are on file and may be reviewed by contacting: Faye A. Talbot, 3470 NE Evangeline Thruway, Lafayette, Louisiana 70507&hyph;2554.

Applicable Regulations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82,
85, and 86; and (b) The program regulations in 34 CFR Parts 364 and 366. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September
30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the NPRM ended on June 13, 1994. A total of 40 comments were received from centers (21), State
agencies (11), Statewide Independent Living Councils and other statewide organizations (4), national constituent
organizations (3), and an individual (1). The comments were generally favorable and constructive. The following
is a summary of the substantive comments received on the NPRM and of the changes that are expected to be made, based on
public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review and that may affect applicants under
this competition. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized
to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one commenter objected to the 30-day comment period. The Secretary considered a 30-day comment period necessary
because a longer comment period would not have left enough time to publish this notice inviting applications for competitive
awards for new centers under this program for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Secretary also considered a 30-day comment
period adequate because of the extensive opportunity for input and comment that was afforded to the public prior to
publishing the NPRM. The Secretary does not believe it is necessary to extend the comment period.

Part 364 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters objected to the change in terminology from an individual with ``severe'' disabilities to an individual
with ``significant'' disabilities. Although only one comment specifically complimenting the Department on the
use of ``significant'' rather than ``severe'' was received in response to the NPRM, the IL community previously expressed
overwhelming support for the change in comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking on the proposed nomenclature
change published on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57938). Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change in the final
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters suggested changes to the definitions in proposed &sect;364.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters were concerned that the proposed definition of ``advocacy'' may be interpreted to require an advocate
to be an attorney. One of these commenters suggested a broader definition of ``advocacy.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of ``advocacy'' specifically states that, to the extent permitted by State law or the rules
of any agency before which an individual is appearing, a non-lawyer may engage in advocacy on behalf of another individual.
The Secretary does not interpret this definition as requiring an advocate to be an attorney in all cases, but only in
those situations where State law or the rules of an agency require that an advocate representing another individual
be an attorney. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change to this definition in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that the proposed definition of ``attendant care'' be revised to make it clear that this service
may be provided on the job and in the community, as well as at home. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes the proposed definition provides adequate flexibility to allow attendant care in a variety
of situations. Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change to this definition in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters questioned why the words ``cognitive'' and ``sensory'' do not appear in the proposed definition of ``individual
with significant disabilities.'' These commenters noted that the proposed definition conflicts with the proposed
definition of an ``individual with a disability.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concepts of ``physical'' and ``mental'' impairments in the statutory definitions of ``individual with a severe
disability'' and ``individual with a disability'' include the concepts of ``sensory'' and ``cognitive'' impairments,
respectively. However, the Secretary agrees that the definitions of ``individual with a significant disability''
and ``individual with a disability'' should be consistent. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates adding the words
``sensory'' and ``cognitive'' to the definition of ``individual with a significant disability'' in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed &sect;364.5, commenters objected to the limitation on reallocating expenditures after the initiation
of an audit or compliance review and considered it punitive and contrary to ordinary accounting procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that a change is necessary to make this requirement consistent with acceptable accounting practices.
Therefore, the Secretary anticipates changing &sect;364.5 in the final regulations to allow costs that a grantee
intends to use as an offset against disallowed costs, if those costs are reported on the final financial status reports
within 90 days after the completion of an audit or compliance review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters objected to the language in proposed &sect;&sect;364.6 and 364.7 regarding program income. Commenters
asserted that the resource development requirement in evaluation standard 7 in section 725(b)(7) of the Act should
be interpreted to permit centers to accumulate funds over several years to create, among other financial instruments,
endowments and reserves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that imposing time limits on the use of program income may be inconsistent with long-term ``resource
development,'' which may include endowment drives and the solicitation of gifts and bequests that may produce long-term
income. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates changing the language in proposed &sect;&sect;364.6 and 364.7 in
the final regulations to allow centers to use program income to establish endowments and other similar financial
instruments, but only if the corpus and income generated from the endowment and other similar financial instruments
are used solely to carry out the purposes of the Center for Independent Living (CIL) program authorized under Part
C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the use of the term ``special'' when referring to reasonable accommodation and ``alternative''
modes of communication in proposed &sect;&sect;364.20, 364.23, and 364.56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenter and anticipates substituting the word ``alternative'' for the word ``special''
in these sections of the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters expressed concern regarding access to records in proposed &sect;364.37(c) on the grounds that access
to individual records may be unnecessarily intrusive and inconsistent with commitments that providers make to their
consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that access to individual case records or files or consumer service records is necessary for
the proper and efficient administration and monitoring of the CIL program. Proposed &sect;364.37(c) limits this
access to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives.
The Secretary does not believe that this access is unreasonable or that it will be abused. Therefore, the Secretary
does not expect any change in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were concerned that the references to ``legally authorized representative'' in proposed &sect;364.51
may be interpreted to require an attorney or legal guardian. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not intend to require that only an attorney or legal guardian may represent an individual for purposes
of proposed &sect;364.51(b)(2)(requirements pertaining to ineligibility determinations). Therefore, the Secretary
anticipates adding a definition of ``legally authorized representative'' to the final regulations to clarify that
an individual's authority to represent or advocate on behalf of an individual with significant disabilities is determined
pursuant to State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters objected to the absence of requirements in proposed &sect;364.52 regarding the content of a waiver
and the appropriate solicitation of a waiver. One of the commenters also was concerned that the absence of conditions
on the use of waivers could allow service providers to circumvent the requirements of proposed &sect;&sect;364.43
(provision of IL services by the State) and 364.53 (documentation of IL services provided to individuals). One of
the commenters also suggested that the regulations should require that consumers be advised of the need for an IL plan
and how the IL plan helps protect the consumer's rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees in part with the commenters and anticipates adding the words ``knowingly and voluntarily''
before the word ``signs'' in &sect;364.52(a)(2) of the final regulations. The Secretary believes this is adequate
protection to prevent the possibility of service providers forcing consumers to sign ``waivers.'' The Secretary
does not believe that it is necessary to add further requirements regarding the waiver of an IL plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters suggested that proposed &sect;364.53 be modified to recognize the fact that records may be electronic
as well as written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees with the commenters. With the exception of an IL plan or a waiver of an IL plan, both of which require
a consumer's signature, the Secretary anticipates revising &sect;364.53 in the final regulations to allow records
to be maintained electronically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that the State standards in proposed &sect;364.55 should not be permitted to exceed the standards
in section 725 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards referred to in proposed &sect;364.55 are actually the standards that the designated State unit (DSU)
is required to develop pursuant to proposed &sect;365.31 for those service providers that are not centers or for centers
that are providing specialized IL services under a contract with the DSU. The Secretary anticipates adding language
to the final regulations to make this clear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the words ``other information'' in proposed &sect;364.56(c)(2) because of the possibility
that service providers may use this language to withhold information from a consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;364.56(c)(2) does not permit a service provider to withhold information from a consumer. Proposed
&sect;364.56(c)(2) merely requires that, if a service provider determines that releasing medical, psychological,
or other information may be harmful if released directly to the consumer, the service provider shall release this
information to the consumer through a qualified medical or psychological professional or the individual's legally
authorized representative. The Secretary does not expect any change to &sect;364.56(c)(2) in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested adding a requirement to the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.27 that the governing
board be reflective of the localities to be served by the proposed center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that, rather than adding the suggested language to the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.27,
replacing the words ``another'' and ``other'' in proposed &sect;366.28(a) with ``bordering'' and adding similar
language in &sect;&sect;366.2(a)(1)(i), 366.28(a), and 366.29(a) of the final regulations is more appropriate.
In this manner, centers will be limited to operating within a ``local community,'' as required by section 702(1)(A)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter considered the selection criterion in proposed &sect;366.27(a)(2) too vague and suggested that it
be expanded to ``not appear to be the traditional `needs assessment' that creates more service providers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the criterion adequately explains how an applicant can be expected to identify the need
for a new center in a community and how the applicant plans to address this identified need. The Secretary does not expect
any change in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested reducing the points allotted to ``plan of operation'' and increasing points for ``involvement
of individuals with significant disabilities'' in the selection criteria in proposed &sect;366.27(g) and (h),
respectively. Commenters also felt that the proposed selection criteria should include the involvement of individuals
with significant disabilities in the preparation of a center's application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the points assigned to the ``plan of operation'' selection criterion appropriately
reflect its value. The Secretary agrees that participation of individuals with significant disabilities in the
preparation of applications is important and anticipates substituting the phrase ``developing the center's application''
for the phrase ``conducting center activities'' in &sect;366.27(h)(1) of the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September
30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking ended on June 13, 1994. Six parties submitted comments on
proposed 34 CFR Part 367. The following is a summary of the comments received and of the changes that are expected to
be made, based on public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters supported the proposed regulations as worded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended adding the word ``may'' to proposed &sect;367.3(b). (Although the commenter identified
the provision as &sect;367.1(b), the comment makes sense only if applied to proposed &sect;367.3(b).) The commenter
stated that the addition of the word ``may'' would give States flexibility in the event they have funds to cover other
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;367.3(a) states that a DSA ``may'' use funds awarded under proposed Part 367 for the activities described
in proposed &sect;&sect;367.1 and in 367.3(b). The Secretary believes that this language already provides a DSA
with adequate flexibility in choosing which services will be provided to individuals in the State. Therefore, no
change to proposed &sect;367.3(b) is expected in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested changing the definition of ``older individual who is blind'' in proposed &sect;367.5 to
make it less restrictive. Because this term is specifically defined in section 751 of the Act, no change to this definition
in proposed &sect;367.5 is expected in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended adding a definition of ``capacity building'' to proposed &sect;367.5. The Secretary
does not believe a definition is necessary because a variety of possible opportunities already exists for local,
regional, and State ``capacity building.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the list of services in proposed &sect;367.22(g) should be the same as that provided
in proposed &sect;367.3(b) and also suggested adding the word ``may'' to &sect;367.22(g)(2). The commenter also
stated that the wording in proposed &sect;367.22(g) could be construed to mean that grant funds have to be used for
all the listed services and that States should not have to duplicate services already provided by the State through
other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary agrees that the list of services in these proposed provisions should be the same. The Secretary expects
that this change will be made to proposed &sect;&sect;367.3(b) and 367.22(g)(2) in the final regulations. The Secretary
also agrees that Chapter 2 funds should be used in a way that will supplement services that may already be available
through other sources. The Secretary expects that proposed &sect;367.22(g)(2) of the final regulations will be
changed to make clear that an application will be evaluated on the extent to which the DSA will use Chapter 2 funds to
meet the unmet independent living (IL) needs of individuals in the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended including older individuals who are blind in the selection of new methods and approaches
for the provision of IL services pursuant to proposed &sect;364.28.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the views of older individuals who are blind will be adequately represented and addressed
by the Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC). The SILC and DSU have joint responsibility for development of
the State plan and for ensuring that consumers have the opportunity to comment on the development and revision of the
State plan during public hearings. The selection and incorporation into the State plan of any new approaches for the
provision of IL services to older individuals who are blind would require a revision to the State plan. Therefore,
the Secretary does not expect any changes in the final regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Two commenters recommended deleting proposed &sect;367.41(b), which restricts a DSA's flexibility to enter into
procurement contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 752(i)(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. 701&hyph;796i, is a
general provision that allows the DSA to operate or administer this program either directly or through grants or contracts,
section 752(g) of the Act requires that a State's awards to public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations
under this program be made only through grants. Therefore, no change to proposed &sect;367.41(b) is expected in the
final regulations.

Priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) and proposed &sect;385.22(a) the Secretary reserves funds to support some or all of the
proposals that have been awarded a rating of 80 points or more under the criteria described in proposed &sect;388.20.
In making a final selection of proposals to support under this program, the Secretary considers the extent to which
proposals have exceeded a rating of 80 points and address one or more of the following absolute priorities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Development and Dissemination of Model In-Service Training Materials and Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project demonstrates an effective plan to develop and disseminate information on its State Vocational
Rehabilitation In-Service Training program, including the identification of training approaches and successful
practices, in order to permit the replication of these programs by other State vocational rehabilitation units.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Distance Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project demonstrates innovative strategies for training State vocational rehabilitation unit personnel
through distance education methods, such as interactive audio, video, computer technologies, or existing telecommunications
networks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Enhanced Employment Outcomes for Specific Populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project supports specialized training in the provision of vocational rehabilitation or related services
to individuals with disabilities to increase the rehabilitation rate into competitive employment for all individuals
or specified target groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 24000), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended June 8, 1994. Sixteen parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is a summary of
the changes that are expected to be made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, based on the
public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters suggested deleting &sect;388.21(a)(4), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a minimum share of not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available to Guam, American
Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The commenters
believe agencies in the territories, some of which have as many employees as small designated State agencies, should
receive the same minimum share of not less than one-third of one percent of the amounts made available for the fiscal
year as provided in &sect;388.21(a)(3) to small agencies. The Secretary agrees that the same minimum share provided
to small designated State agencies is appropriate for the specified territories. The Secretary also notes that the
territories are eligible to compete for the remaining funds to be allocated based on the quality of the application
as determined by competitive reviews conducted by the Department using the selection criteria in &sect;388.20 and
the priorities in &sect;388.22. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.21(a) by deleting paragraph (4) so that
all grant recipients receive the same minimum share of the sums made available for the fiscal year. A revision of &sect;388.30,
deleting paragraph (c), which provides special matching considerations for the territories, is also expected to
be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested definitions for the terms ``succession planning'' and ``capacity building'' used in &sect;388.1.
The Secretary notes that these terms are found in the statute, but are optional for State agencies to address in their
in-service training. There are alternative ways to address these terms, and the Secretary prefers not to define them,
thus leaving the widest possible discretion to State agencies. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters addressed the requirement in &sect;388.20(a)(2)(iii) for an annual needs assessment of in-service
training needs. The commenters believe an annual assessment is not necessary and recommend a comprehensive needs
assessment every three years and a less comprehensive review annually. The Secretary agrees that a comprehensive
assessment is not needed annually. A revision of &sect;388.20(a)(2)(iii), deleting the word ``annual,'' is expected
to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters noted that the regulations do not specify the length of projects. Recommendations of project periods
of 36 and 60 months were made. The Secretary notes that regulations usually do not specify project duration and instead
leave flexibility for the Secretary to determine an appropriate project period each time a competition is announced.
This notice solicits applications for a 36-month period. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked that the phrase ``in connection with a distance learning training course'' be dropped from the description
of allowable telecommunications and technology fees in &sect;388.31(d). The Secretary agrees that distance learning
may include valuable in-service training activities, such as a lecture or technology demonstration, that are not
part of a training course. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.31(d) by deleting the words ``in connection
with a distance learning training course.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that it was an unnecessary limitation to require that distance education for rehabilitation workers
be at their job sites as stated in &sect;388.22(b)(2). The commenter noted that it may be necessary or efficient for
an agency to gather a group of employees at a central location removed from individual offices for distance education.
The Secretary agrees that there is no compelling reason to require in this priority that training occur at an individual
job site. The Secretary expects to revise &sect;388.22(b)(2) by deleting the words ``at their job sites.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested clarification of the heading for &sect;388.22(b)(3), which refers to ``specific populations''
although the text that follows refers to ``all individuals or specified groups.'' The Secretary believes that it
is up to the State agency to determine whether in-service training to improve employment outcomes will be targeted
narrowly or broadly. Activities directed to improving employment outcomes for all population groups or for a specific
target group are permitted under this priority. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter observed that the NPRM retains most of the language in the current regulations and does not accurately
reflect the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 Amendments), particularly provisions related to State
and strategic plans. The Secretary believes that extensive changes have been proposed in the current regulations
and is confident that all requirements in the 1992 Amendments have been implemented. No change is expected to be made
in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters supported reserving a portion of funds for priorities, but believe this reserve should be divided
between priorities based on need and priorities based on responsiveness or quality of the application and innovative
approaches. The Secretary believes that the three priorities listed in the proposed regulations address significant
needs of State agencies and that no further division of the priorities into categories is needed. No change is expected
to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters objected to the proposed formula in &sect;388.21 whereby 80 percent of the funds available would
be distributed based on the number of staff and 20 percent of the funds available would be distributed based on quality.
They believe that the split penalizes States with small populations with limited capacity to write grants. In the
commenters' view, the distribution does not take into account extra travel costs in a State with a large geographic
area, and a commenter suggested increasing the small State agency minimum share. The Secretary believes that the
proposed formula maximizes the amount of funds available for basic awards while ensuring that a reasonable amount
is available for small agencies and for the Secretary's priorities. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended dropping the priority in &sect;388.22(b)(2) for distance education on the grounds that
there is no evidence that distance education produces better results at less cost. The Secretary believes that distance
education is needed in some States and wants to ensure that a mechanism exists to demonstrate innovative approaches
to learning. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended deleting &sect;388.20(f)(1)(ii) of the evaluation selection criteria that would judge
in-service training outcomes by the extent to which training results in improved individual competency through
licensure, certification, or award of academic degrees or certificates. The commenters believe in-service training
to be short-term and job-based; therefore, reference to improved individual competency through degree-based programs
should be dropped. The Secretary believes that, in response to the need to increase the number of qualified rehabilitation
personnel, academic outcomes must be included among the measures of in-service training programs. No change is expected
to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters observed that reviewers for in-service proposals should be well qualified, represent diverse
populations, and be identified by name and program affiliation after the review is completed. They commented that
all applicants should receive reviewer comments. The Secretary agrees that reviewers must be qualified and representative
of the diverse populations and agencies assisted through in-service training. The Secretary does make summary information
available on characteristics of reviewers but believes the specific reviewers of proposals should remain anonymous.
All applicants are provided with the reviewer comments on their applications when the review is completed. No change
is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that &sect;388.21 does not state what the minimum score is that an applicant must receive in order
for its application to be approved by the Secretary or how it is to be computed. In order to make funding decisions, the
Secretary will set a minimum score for each competition after all applications have been reviewed. The minimum score
will be computed through an analysis of all reviewed applications to determine those that are in the fundable range.
No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

A commenter observed that &sect;388.1 should be revised, and the regulations changed throughout, to emphasize human
resource development in place of training. Peer reviewers should be oriented to human resource development prior
to their service as reviewers. The Secretary agrees that the term human resource development is descriptive of many
appropriate activities under this program. However, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, uses the term ``in-service
training,'' so that term is used in the regulations. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding &sect;388.22, which sets the Secretary's priorities, a commenter asked if an application that addresses
issues or activities other than the three priorities listed can be eligible for quality funds. The Secretary responds
that only applications that respond to the priorities already identified by the Secretary in the regulations for
this program or priorities established through future rulemaking will be considered when allocating the quality
funds. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes
contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review,

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing
has reviewed a non-capacity related amendment of license for the City of Hamilton Hydroelectric Project, No. 2724&hyph;008.
The City of Hamilton Hydroelectric Project is located on the Miami River in Butler County, Ohio. The application is
for approval to remove and replace the existing powerhouse superstructure and lowering the elevation of the powerhouse
and generating unit. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving
the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Western Area Power Administration (Western), a Federal power marketing agency of the Department of Energy (DOE),
has developed proposed procedures to fulfill the requirements of section 2929 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for fiscal year 1994 (National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat. 1547, 1935 (1993))
(NDA Act). Under the proposed procedures to implement the requirements of the NDA Act, Western would allocate up to
119.223 megawatts (MW) of Power from the Central Valley Project (CVP), which represents the amount of CVP Power provided
as of November 30, 1993, to military installations. The NDA Act was signed into public law on November 30, 1993. Section
2929 of the NDA Act provides that, for a 10-year period beginning on November 30, 1993, the electric power allocations
provided as of November 30, 1993, by Western from the CVP to military installations in the State of California which
have been closed or approved for closure pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A, Title
XXIX, Pub. L. 101&hyph;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) (1990 Act) shall be reserved for sale through Long-Term Contracts
to Preference Entities which agree to use such Power to promote economic development at a military installation that
is closed or approved for closure pursuant to the 1990 Act. To the extent Power reserved by the NDA Act is not disposed
of through Long-Term Contracts, it shall be made available on a temporary basis during such 10-year period to military
installations in the State of California through Short-Term Contracts. By implementing these Procedures, Western
will establish the criteria to allocate the Power made available as a result of the NDA Act.

The procedures set forth in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will explain in detail how Western intends to implement the NDA Act. Under the proposed NDA Act Procedures, Western
has identified the Power that will be classified as NDA Act Power and the types of services and contracts that will be
offered. Also set forth under the proposed NDA Act Procedures are the general eligibility criteria that Western will
apply to all applicants requesting an Allocation of NDA Act Power, and the procedures to be used by applicants when
applying for NDA Act Power, which include demonstration that certain economic development criteria are being met.
Lastly, Western has set forth the procedures that will be used in allocating NDA Act Power to eligible applicants,
including a priority list developed by Western for allocating NDA Act Power. In general, the proposed Procedures
provide that the allocation of CVP Power as of November 30, 1993, at a military installation that is closed or approved
for closure under the 1990 Act will be classified as NDA Act Power and will be reserved through November 30, 2003, for
use at that military installation. Until the NDA Act Power is fully utilized at that military installation, the NDA
Act Power will be made available on a temporary basis as described in Section G.1. of the NDA Act Procedures.

 On October 5, 1992, Western's Sacramento Area Office published notice of the Final 1994 Power Marketing Plan, Central
Valley Project, California (57 FR 45782), governing allocations of 529.946 MW of Power from the CVP. That notice provided
the final allocation of a total of 119.223 MW of Power to certain Department of Defense (DOD) military installations,
as specified in Appendix A herein. Contracts for such Power were entered into for a term ending December 31, 2004. The
power contracts with the DOD agencies allow for certain shifts of Power among military installations with approval
by Western. Effective November 30, 1993, such shifts became subject to the NDA Act.

Western will use the following procedures to allocate NDA Act Power to a qualified applicant: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Western will determine whether sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is available to fulfill the applicant's request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) If sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is available to fulfill the applicant's request, Western shall allocate
the amount needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) If sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is not available to fulfill the applicant's request, Western shall allocate
all Unutilized NDA Act Power and recall and reallocate NDA Act Power CROD to fulfill the request by following the reallocation
procedures stated in G.3. below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) To ensure the most equitable distribution of long-term firm NDA Act and Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power, Western
proposes that each Allocation of NDA Act Power shall be determined as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If using the above procedure would result in an Allocation of Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power which is less than 500 kW,
Western will modify the procedure to ensure that the Allottee receives a minimum of 500 kW of Long-Term Firm NDA Act
Power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) Allocations will be made only to those applicants who qualify pursuant to the final NDA Act Procedures. The NDA
Act Power must be used at a Closed Military Installation or a Priority-Three Base, or the NDA Act Power must be used by
a Negatively Affected Customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vi) The Allottee has the right to purchase NDA Act Power only when a new electric service contract between Western
and the Allottee has been executed and when all conditions precedent in that contract have been satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (vii) To consummate any Allocation of NDA Act Power, an electric service contract shall be executed within 6 months

5. Contract Terms for the Purpose of NDA Act Power
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Long-Term Contracts:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western proposes that Long-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric
service for a period ending by December 31, 2004, and be subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in the final
NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Long-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time of the contract
offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part of the NDA Act
Power CROD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Short-Term Contracts:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western proposes that Short-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric
service during a temporary period ending by December 31, 2004, subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in
the final NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Short-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time
of the contract offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part
of the NDA Act Power CROD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For any applicant requesting NDA Act Power to be used for an economic development project, the point of delivery
for the NDA Act Power must be at the Closed Military Installation where the NDA Act Power will be used, unless otherwise
agreed to by Western.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The minimum Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power CROD shall be 500 kW.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Transmission Service:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All transmission arrangements beyond Western's CVP system are the full responsibility of the Allottee. Western
will assist the Allottee in obtaining third-party transmission arrangements with PG&amp;E for delivery of Power
allocated under the final NDA Act Procedures. Nonetheless, each Allottee is ultimately responsible for obtaining
its own delivery arrangements. Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee is unable to arrange
for the transmission necessary to receive the CROD within 6 months of the execution of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) For those Allottees that receive NDA Act Power to be used at a Closed Military Installation, the following provisions
must be complied with:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee cannot demonstrate that it is using the NDA Act
Power for an economic development project within 1 year of the execution of the contract, unless otherwise agreed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Allottee must provide a report to Western each January 15, which describes the benefits of the NDA Act Power
CROD being passed on to the organization operating the economic development project. This report must be provided
to Western in such a way that Western can separately identify the composite energy and capacity costs stated in mills
per kWh of NDA Act Power and non-NDA Act Power. The report must also show that the economic development project is still
in operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Western, at its sole discretion, shall have the right to either withdraw NDA Act Power or terminate its contract
with the Allottee upon 30 days' written notice if the Allottee does not comply with G.5.(vi)(B) above for each year
of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Standard Provisions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contracts entered into as a result of the final NDA Act Procedures will incorporate Western's standard provisions
for power sales contracts, resale of electric energy, and conservation and renewable energy in addition to the General
Power Contract Provisions. Western is in the process of developing procedures to require that all long-term firm
customers develop an integrated resource plan consistent with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is anticipated that
these procedures will be effective in late 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., each agency, when required to publish a proposed
rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined that (1) this rulemaking relates to services
offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of the Act, and (2) the impacts of an Allocation from
Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. The requirements of this Act can be waived if the
head of the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. By his execution of this Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

entities will occur.

as a result of the original allocation of this Power to the military installations. These studies and analysis are
published in the Revised Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact which were prepared by Western
for its Sacramento Area Office 1994 Power Marketing Plan. Western is examining the applicability of the 1994 Revised

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators of brass and bronze production facilities must notify EPA of construction, reconstruction,
modification, startup, shutdown, and malfunction of reverberatory and electric furnaces of 1,000 kg or greater
production capacity, and blast furnaces of 250 kg/hr or greater production capacity. Owners or operators must record
all data and calculations and results of initial performance tests and submit that data to EPA. Owners or operators
are also required to maintain records of the occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the
operation of an affected facility, or any period in which the monitoring system is inoperative. Recurring compliance
reports are not required under this standard. EPA uses the data to determine the ability of each plant to comply with
the emission standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This ICR is an extension of an existing collection for Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) planning
requirements in support of the Clean Water Act at paragraph (1) Section 311 (j), and described at 40 CFR 112. The information
will be used by the EPA to ensure that oil spill prevention planning occurs, thereby ensuring compliance with the requirements
of 40 CFR 112.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this ICR, owners or operators of affected facilities must: (1) Prepare the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7),
(2) maintain the plan and appropriate records (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7(e)) if they begin operations or significantly
modify their facilities during the approval period, (3) submit the plan in the event of certain discharges of oil (40
CFR 112.4), (4) revise the plan following modification of the facility (40 CFR 112.5(a)), and (5) conduct a triennial
review of the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SPCC plan should describe: (1) possible equipment failures that could lead to a discharge of oil from the facility
(40 CFR 112.7(b)); (2) the use of required preventive measures such as appropriate containment and/or diversion
structures or equipment (40 CFR 112.7(c)), or if containment is not available, an oil spill contingency plan and a
written commitment of manpower, equipment and materials required to expeditiously control and remove any harmful
quantity of oil discharged (40 CFR 112.7(d)); and (3) a discussion of the more detailed planning requirements (40
CFR 112.7(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these general requirements, onshore facilities must maintain records of maintenance and usage of
bypass valves and comparison records on past inspections of aboveground storage tanks. Offshore facilities must
maintain written procedures for inspecting and testing pollution prevention equipment, keep records of well shut-in
valves, prepare written instructions for contractors and subcontractors, and maintain records of inspection of
submarine pipelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there are 450,360 facilities subject to this regulation, with an estimated increase in the regulated universe
of 4,549 facilities per year over the next three years. Facility records related to compliance must be maintained
for three years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Statement: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public reporting burden for new facilities subject to this collection of information is estimated to range between
39.6 and 100.6 hours per response, with an average of 40.5 hours including time for reviewing the Oil Pollution Prevention
regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining data, and preparing and reviewing the
SPCC plan. The annual recordkeeping burden for existing facilities is estimated to range from 5.0 to 13.9 hours per
respondent, with an average recordkeeping burden of 5.5 hours including time for maintaining. reviewing and updating
the SPCC plan.

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is an extension of an existing information collection sponsored by the Office of Water in support of the requirements
set forth by Sections 205(a) and 516(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA requires EPA to conduct a ``needs survey''
every two years as a joint effort of the respondents (States, territories, and the District of Columbia), and EPA's
Office of Water and Regional Offices to gather construction cost estimates and technical data on all existing and
proposed POTWs. The survey results enable EPA, States and Congress to accurately assess construction requirements
and develop allotment formulas for wastewater treatment resource allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents will provide information that includes: 1) updated technical and construction cost information on
municipal wastewater treatment facilities, 2) planning documentation relevant to construction or project costs
of POTWs (capital improvement plans, diagnostics results of needs for construction, etc.), 3) justification of
certain specified categories of need based on construction costs curves, and 4) population anomalies relevant to
POTWs. Respondents will also be asked to provide information related to combined sewer overflows (CSOs), non-point
source and stormwater discharges. The majority of respondents will enter the information using EPA's on-line computerized
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will manage the conduct of the survey, perform quality control and assurance on the needs survey database, and
prepare the final report to Congress using the information provided by the respondents.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces the availability of and requests comments regarding the proposed addenda which includes a
draft Data Reporting Guidelines (DRG) for those environmental chemistry methods associated with Subdivision N,
E, and K. This draft DRG is not intended to introduce any new data requirements or revisions into the existing guidelines.
Its purpose is to further clarify technical aspects of the existing Pesticide Assessment Guidelines and to provide
a format for organizing and submitting soil and water methods and their supporting data in order to facilitate their
review. EPA recognizes there are sections of the draft DRG that do not apply to specific soil and water methods; therefore,
registrants should exercise scientific judgement in deciding which sections apply to their methods.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The draft DRG provides the registrant with a detailed format for submitting soil and water methods to the Agency. Each
method should be complete and meet the technical requirements identified in the DRG. Those methods should be sent
to the Agency to support specific exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects studies during the normal
registration and reregistration cycle. Each study for which environmental chemistry methods are needed has been
clearly identified below. Soil and water methods should be clearly written and capable of being repeated by chemists
in Federal and state laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft DRG is not intended to introduce any requirements. Its purpose is to further clarify technical aspects of
the existing Pesticide Assessment Guidelines and to provide a format for organizing and submitting soil and water

These addenda supercede the paragraphs in the respective guidelines and the other addenda issued by the Pesticide
Program regarding soil and water methods sent to the Agency for the studies identified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these addenda to the Guidelines are not mandatory, data submitters are strongly encouraged to follow the format
to assure that reports will be consistent, thereby increasing the efficiency of pesticide registration, reregistration,
and other regulatory activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the ninth addendum to Subdivision N-Environmental Fate (Chemistry) published by the Agency. This new addenda
with the draft DRG has been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and other
organizations within EPA for comment. With this notice EPA plans to make the DRG available to the public for comment
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires the registration of all pesticides that
are manufactured for use in the United States. In order to obtain a registration from EPA, manufacturers must demonstrate
that their pesticides do not cause any unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. It is now
considered appropriate to provide available soil and water residue methods to EPA because of the increased public
concern regarding the contamination of the environment with pesticides. EPA will validate some of those methods
and may assemble them into a new manual in order to make them available to address potential environmental problems.
This DRG provides more detailed technical guidance regarding those analytical methods and amends Pesticide Assessment
Guideline N, E, and K referred to earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These methods may be validated in an EPA laboratory to determine if they identify and quantify the pesticide parent
compound, toxicologically significant metabolites, and degradates at the level indicated. The results from the
soil and water method validation program may be used to support regulatory decisions regarding the reliability and
validity of the chemistry data sent to the Agency with exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects studies.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), this Notice announces
EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in swimming pools, hot tubs,
and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32) and Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg.
No. 7124&hyph;93), produced by Alden Leeds, Inc.; and Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33) and Algicil
Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54), produced by N. Jonas Company. EPA is taking this action because it believes that
the use of the products, in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally causes unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. Specifically, EPA is concerned with potential cancer and non-cancer effects
resulting from exposure to simazine in swimming pools. EPA believes that the risks from this particular simazine
use exceed the benefits derived from this use. Effective the date of final cancellation, EPA will not allow further
sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of these products, as described in this Notice. Holders of existing
stocks are subject to FIFRA section 6(g) reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in
swimming pools, hot tubs, and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32), Nuclo Dry

B. Legal Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product
must be registered by EPA pursuant to FIFRA section 3(a) (7 U.S.C. 136a(a)). A registration is a license allowing a
pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance with use instructions, precautions,
and other terms and conditions of the registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to obtain a registration for a pesticide under FIFRA, an applicant must demonstrate that the pesticide satisfies
the statutory standard for registration, section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5)). That standard requires,
among other things, that the pesticide performs its intended function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment.'' The term ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined under FIFRA section
2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental
costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide'' (7 U.S.C. 136(bb)). This standard requires a finding that the benefits
of the use of the pesticide exceed the risks of use, when the pesticide is used in compliance with the terms and conditions
of registration or in accordance with commonly recognized practices. The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide
product satisfies the statutory criteria for registration is at all times on the proponents of registration, and
continues as long as the registration is in effect

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under FIFRA section 6(b), EPA may issue a notice of intent to cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever
it appears to the Administrator that the product, when used in accordance with widespread and generally recognized
practice, generally causes unreasonable effects (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Registrants and other adversely affected persons may request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified registration
and use. If they do so in a legally effective manner, the registration and use will be continued pending a decision at
the conclusion of an administrative hearing.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, EPA classified simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 1). Simazine is used primarily as an agricultural
herbicide; swimming pool use accounts for less than 2 percent of total simazine usage. In August 1993, EPA conducted
a risk assessment for the swimming pool use (Ref. 2). The risk assessment revealed high potential cancer and non-cancer
health risks to children and adults exposed to water treated with simazine algaecides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of its risk concerns, EPA requested that the 13 registrants of the simazine swimming pool algaecides cease
product formulation and voluntarily cancel their product registrations (Refs. 3 and 4). In response to EPA's request,
nine of the registrants--A &amp; V, Great Lakes Biochemical, Applied Biochemists, Aqua Clear Industries, Western
Purity Biochemical, Poolmaster, Leslie's Pool Supplies, York Chemical, and Quantum Biochemical--requested a
FIFRA section 6(f) voluntary product cancellation. Also, pursuant to FIFRA section 4(i)(5)(D), EPA canceled two
registrations held by EZ-Clor Systems and one held by N. Jonas Company, for failure to pay the annual registration
maintenance fees for those registrations. The cancellation order for the registrations held by these 11 registrants
was published on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18120). A separate order, cancelling the registration of Aladdin Winter Care
(EPA Reg. No. 11329&hyph;17) for failure to pay the annual registration maintenance fee for that product registration,
was signed on May 16, 1994. The order was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and became effective on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27016). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. still hold the following registrations for the following simazine products: Nuclo Dry
Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32), Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;93), Winterizing
Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33), and Algicil Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three registrants of technical simazine--Ciba-Geigy, Drexel Chemical, and Oxon-Italia--are not supporting
the swimming pool simazine use. That is, these manufacturers of the simazine active ingredient do not have their simazine
products registered for swimming pool-related uses. None of Drexel Chemical's products were registered for aquatic
use, and Ciba-Geigy and Oxon-Italia had ceased supporting all aquatic uses before EPA conducted its risk assessment.
The aquatic-use cancellation for Ciba-Geigy, the supplier of technical simazine for the swimming pool products,
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 1, 1992 (57 FR 29309) and became effective on October 9, 1992. The notice of Oxon-Italia's request for aquatic
use cancellations was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6021), and became effective 90 days from that publication date. At EPA's request, Ciba-Geigy
and Oxon-Italia have amended their product labels to explicitly prohibit reformulation of their products into swimming
pool products; Drexel has amended its technical simazine label to prohibit formulation into aquatic-use products.
Because manufacturers of simazine swimming pool products must formulate their products from technical simazine,
the effect of these actions is that there is no legal source of simazine active ingredient from which the swimming pool
product manufacturers may formulate any simazine products.

III. Summary of Toxicological Concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on toxicological studies in laboratory animals, EPA has determined that simazine may pose cancer and non-cancer
risks to individuals exposed to this pesticide. The results of these studies, as well as the EPA classification of
the carcinogenic potential of simazine, are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Carcinogenicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA reviewed the simazine toxicological data base, including rat and mouse chronic feeding/carcinogenicity studies,
in its evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of simazine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rat study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a 2&hyph;year chronic feeding carcinogenicity study, simazine technical was administered in the diet of 340 male
and 340 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (MRID No. 40614405). The study had two phases: a carcinogenicity phase and
a chronic phase. An equal number of male and female rats were randomly divided into four major groups; 50 animals/sex/group
were used in the carcinogenicity phase, and 30 to 40 animals/sex/group were used in the chronic phase. Animals were
dosed at 0 (control), 10, 100, or 1,000 ppm of simazine for 2 years (corresponding to 0.41, 4.17, or 45.77 mg/kg/day
in males; and 0.52, 5.34, or 63.10 mg/kg/day in females). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the carcinogenicity phase, results in the female SD rats indicated that there was a statistically significant
dose-related trend in mammary gland carcinomas, as well as in combined adenomas and carcinomas. The incidence of
mammary gland carcinomas was statistically significantly increased at both the 100 and 1,000 ppm groups, as compared
to the controls. Also, the incidence of combined adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the highest dose tested (HDT) group, as compared to the controls. Mammary gland carcinomas in the main study contributed
to increased mortality in the HDT animals. A higher incidence of mammary gland carcinomas was also seen in the recovery
study (52 weeks of treatment at 1,000 ppm, followed by 52 weeks of recovery) for the control (1/10) and the HDT (4/10)
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of hyperplastic changes (cystic glandular hyperplasia) in the mammary glands of female rats was statistically
significantly higher in the HDT animals than in the controls. This finding correlates with the observed high incidence
of tumors in the HDT group. It is generally understood that the higher tumor incidence correlates directly with a higher
incidence of hyperplastic changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the female rats, the incidence of pituitary carcinomas was found to be statistically significantly higher in the
HDT animals than in the controls. The incidence of pituitary adenomas was found to be extremely high in all groups.
Further statistical analysis of these tumors (total tumor analysis) indicated that the incidence of combined adenomas/carcinomas
in the mid- and high-dose groups was statistically significantly higher than in the controls, and also exhibited
a significant increasing dose-related trend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a statistically significant dose-related trend for the incidence of kidney tubular adenomas in female
rats. However, the tumors occurred only at the HDT, and the incidence was not statistically significant as compared
to the control animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the male SD rats, the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas was very low in all treated and control
groups. The incidence of combined hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the HDT group, as compared to the control group. These incidences fell within the historical control range for this
testing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A very low incidence of kidney tubular adenomas and carcinomas was seen in male rats. A statistically significant
dose-related trend was observed for the incidence of carcinomas, as well as for the incidence of combined adenomas
and carcinomas. However, tumors occurred only at the HDT, and tumor incidences were not statistically significantly
elevated as compared to concurrent controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this study, the Health Effects Division (HED) of the Office of Pesticide Programs Cancer Peer Review Committee
concluded that the highest dose exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for female rats, based on excess deaths
and body-weight-gain reductions. The Committee also agreed that the highest dose in male rats appeared to have exceeded
the MTD, based on a significant decrease in body-weight gain. However, the mid-level dose was well below the MTD, and
mammary gland tumors in the female rat were statistically significantly increased at both the mid- and high-dose
levels. In addition, the Committee concluded that there was too great an interval between the mid (100 ppm) and high
(1,000 ppm) doses. These factors were taken into account in the weight-of-evidence considerations that led the Committee
to classify simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2).

2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Mouse study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no evidence of a relationship between simazine exposure and carcinogenicity in the mouse. In a 1988 chronic
feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice, simazine technical was administered in the diet to a group of 60 male and 60
female CD1 (ICR) BR mice at 0 (control), 40, 1,000, or 4,000 ppm for 95 weeks (MRID No. 40614404). There were no increases
in neoplasms reported for any dosed group and no evidence of compound-related effect on survival or target organ toxicity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Classification of carcinogenic potential.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on the weight-of-evidence, the HED Cancer Peer Review Committee concluded that simazine should be classified
as a Group C possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2). This determination was primarily based on results from the 2&hyph;year
chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats. Based on EPA's evaluation of the data presented in this study, EPA
concluded that technical-grade simazine is carcinogenic in female SD rats, inducing the formation of mammary gland
carcinomas. There is evidence in the published literature that simazine has genotoxic activity, and this was considered
in the weight-of-evidence evaluation of simazine's carcinogenicity classification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rat study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA determined that the 2&hyph;year rat chronic feeding study, described in unit III. A.1. of this notice, was appropriate
for assessing non-cancer risks for ``competitive'' exposure to simazine. A No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) of 0.52
mg/kg/day was established based on decreased body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters that occurred
at 5.34 mg/kg/day. These effects, which include depressed red-blood-cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, are
considered to be reversible when exposure is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Rabbit study.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For evaluation of non-cancer risks from ``recreational'' exposure to simazine, EPA based its risk assessment on
the results of a rabbit developmental toxicity study (MRID No. 001611407). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this study, 19 female New Zealand White rabbits per dose level were artificially inseminated and administered
technical grade simazine once daily by gastric intubation at doses of 5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg of body weight.
A significant reduction in mean fetal weight and a significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with skeletal
variations were observed at the 200 mg/kg dose level. Therefore, the developmental NOEL for this study is 75 mg/kg
of body weight. In the mothers, significant decreases in body weight gain, tremors, and abortions were observed in
the mid- and high-dose groups (75 and 200 mg/kg dose levels). The maternal NOEL was therefore established at 5 mg/kg
of body weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Exposure Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA developed four exposure scenarios based on the frequency and duration of exposure (competitive versus recreational
swimming), and on the age and weight of the swimmer (6&hyph;year&hyph;old child versus 35&hyph;year&hyph;old male).
The assessment assumed exposure to the entire body through dermal, oral, buccal and sublingual, orbital and nasal,
aural, and inhalation routes. High-exposure frequency, or ``competitive,'' 6&hyph;year&hyph;old and 35&hyph;year&hyph;old
swimmers are assumed to have daily exposures of 3 and 5 hours, respectively, for 150 days per year (Ref. 5). Based on
these assumptions, EPA estimates that ``competitive'' swimmers are exposed to an Actual Daily Exposure (ADE) of
0.12 mg/kg/day for children, and 0.07 mg/kg/day for adults. Low-exposure frequency, or ``recreational,'' swimmers
of both age groups are assumed to be exposed for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a year. This low exposure results in an ADE of
0.02 mg/kg/day for children and 0.0073 mg/kg/day for adults. EPA assumed that lifetime exposure constitutes 30 years
of exposure over a 75&hyph;year lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Simazine concentrations in swimming pool water were calculated based on label application rates. Although simazine
is soluble to only 3.5 parts per million (ppm) in water at 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, EPA assumed that swimmers could be exposed to average simazine concentrations of 5 ppm, because solubility
could increase at temperatures above 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that it is not necessary to conduct a separate exposure assessment for the simazine product that
is used to control algae in swimming pools during the off-season or winter months. A separate assessment is unnecessary
because the exposure levels for the winter-use (winterizer) product are comparable to the exposure levels for the
non-winterizer simazine swimming pool products. Label application rates for winterizer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-winterizer products are similar. In addition, label directions do not require swimming pools that have been
treated with winterizer products to be drained before they are used by swimmers. Because EPA has no data concerning
simazine dissipation, EPA must assume that following initial or subsequent winterizer treatment, simazine does
not dissipate from swimming pool water. Consequently, swimmers could be exposed to unacceptable levels of simazine
when winterized swimming pools are opened for use. Therefore, EPA believes that the individual risk posed to swimmers
from exposure to simazine used as a winterizer is not significantly different from other exposure scenarios.

, based on mammary gland cancer in laboratory animals. The Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) reviewed the carcinogenicity
of simazine in September 1989 and, while agreeing with the Group C classification, did not recommend the use of a quantitative
risk assessment (Ref. 6). The SAP noted that certain pesticides, such as simazine, may alter endocrine physiology
in the rat and influence the incidence of mammary gland tumors; the SAP therefore recommended that EPA formulate a
position on the regulation of chemicals with this mechanism.

B. Non-Cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA measures non-cancer risks by calculating a margin of exposure (MOE), which is a comparison of the NOEL to actual
daily exposure, both of which are expressed in milligrams of chemical dose per kilogram of body weight per day. An MOE
less than 100 generally represents an unacceptable risk.

Non-cancer risk to swimmers from high exposure frequency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The high exposure frequency assumed for the competitive swimmer categories necessitated the use of a long-term toxicity
study to calculate non-cancer risk. The 2&hyph;year chronic rat feeding study was therefore used to calculate the
MOEs for competitive swimmers. The risks to swimmers for the non-cancer effects seen in the chronic study--reduction
in body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters (anemia)--are reflected in MOEs of 4.3 for children
and 7.4 for adults. The MOEs for swimmers in the competitive category, based on effects seen in the chronic feeding
study, are well below 100 and therefore indicate an unacceptable risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Non-cancer risk to swimmers from low exposure frequency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA does not consider swimmers exposed at a low exposure frequency (i.e., a few short exposures per year) to be at risk
of exhibiting non-cancer effects (Ref. 8). Because of the low exposure frequency assumed for the recreational swimmer
categories, the rabbit developmental toxicity study was used to calculate MOEs. The effects of reduction in maternal
body weight gain, abortions, and tremors were manifested at very high dose levels and are considered signs of general
systemic toxicity in the test animals. EPA calculated MOEs of 250 for children and 685 for adults exposed to simazine
in swimming pools. This indicates that recreational swimmers are not at risk from the effects seen in the developmental
toxicity study.

VI. Benefits and Impact of Cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under FIFRA, a pesticide registration may only be maintained if the benefits of the use of the pesticide exceed the
risks of use. EPA has found that at least some of the registered alternative algaecides provide comparative control
at comparative prices, during summer season use. EPA has concluded that the benefits associated with Nuclo Dry Granular
Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, and Algicil Plus are negligible when compared to the total operating costs on a
per&hyph;pool basis. The cancellation of these products for summer use will have a negligible impact on the pool industry
and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has also found that the benefits associated with Winterizing Algaecide are relatively small. This information
is based on the fact that there are a number of alternatives to simazine winterizing products on the market, and the
labels of many of these alternative products indicate that they are used at a similar frequency as simazine. Although
EPA has anecdotal information that suggests simazine may have a longer duration of activity, which could, if true,
result in a cost savings, there are no data to support this. Therefore, EPA concludes that the loss of simazine winterizing
products would have only a small impact on the swimming pool industry and the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice will not have a significant economic impact in part because
they account for only a small share of the algaecide market for swimming pool use. EPA estimates that all 22 simazine
products account for less than 10 percent of the market for algaecides for swimming pool use. Registrants of 18 of these
products have already requested voluntary cancellation of their registrations, or have had their registrations
canceled for maintenance fee non-payment. The remaining four products subject to this Notice account for less than
1 percent of the total swimming pool algaecide market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic impact of cancelling these four products is minimized by the availability of registered alternative
algaecides for swimming pool use. Because these alternatives have a substantially greater market share than simazine,
the cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice should not result in significant price increases in the
non-simazine products. For the same reasons, EPA does not expect market dislocations due to the inability to produce
the alternative algaecides to meet demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. indicated to EPA that they have accounted for approximately 25,000 gallons of liquid product
in their possession or in the channels of trade, and 14,000 pounds of unformulated Ciba-Geigy simazine product that
Ciba-Geigy has agreed to buy back. Given the small amount of these products and the over 3 million swimming pools in
the United States that could use simazine pool products, cancellation of these products would have little impact
on the swimming pool industry. Section 6(b) of FIFRA requires EPA to consider the impact of cancellation upon the agricultural
economy (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). EPA has determined that the cancellation of these products will have no impact upon the
agricultural economy because these products are registered for swimming pool use, and not for agricultural uses.

VII. Risk/Benefit Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 6(b) of FIFRA, the Administrator may cancel a pesticide due to unreasonable adverse effects, if the
pesticide generally causes an ``unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social,
and environmental costs and benefits'' of the pesticide's use (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preceding sections of this Notice, the cancer and non- cancer risks to human health from continued
registration of Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, Winterizing Algaecide, and Algicil Plus are
significant, while the benefits of continued registration are negligible for summer use, and are relatively small
for the winterizing use. EPA believes that the risks posed by continued registration are unreasonable when compared
to the benefits, and that simazine use in swimming pools should be canceled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making its determination to propose cancellation, EPA has also examined whether any measures short of cancellation
exist to reduce exposure to acceptable levels, and has concluded that there are none. For the summer use, no measures
could be identified to reduce risk to an acceptable range. For the winterizer use, EPA considered allowing registrants
to retain that use, if data were submitted that showed that superchlorination of pools following simazine use eliminated
the product from treated water. No such data were submitted to EPA. Therefore, EPA has determined that for both the
summer and winter use, there are no acceptable measures short of cancellation.

VIII. Role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA provide certain opportunities for the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and
the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to review and comment upon a draft NOIC, and in the case of USDA,
an analysis of the impact of the proposed action on the agricultural economy. These reviews may be waived, and when
they are, the Notice may be published without delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 5, 1994, EPA asked the SAP and Secretary of USDA to waive their rights to review and comment on this Notice (Refs.
9 and 10). On April 12, 1994, Nancy Ragsdale, Director, National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program,
USDA, notified EPA that the Secretary would waive review of this action (Ref. 11). On May 25, 1994, the SAP notified
EPA that it waived its review of this action (Ref. 12). Because the SAP and USDA have waived their review of this action,
EPA is issuing this Notice without delay.

IX. Disposition of Existing Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of simazine products for use in swimming pools
that were in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to July 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has an established policy for determinations concerning the sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks of
canceled pesticides (56 FR 29362, June 26, 1991). That policy states that in cases where EPA has identified a significant
risk concern and the registration is canceled, EPA will make existing stocks determinations on a case-by-case basis.
In most cases EPA will not permit the continued sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of a canceled product
raising risk concerns unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits exceed the risks. EPA reserves the right to amend
this existing stocks provision, should conditions warrant such amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The swimming pool use of simazine poses unreasonable cancer and non- cancer risk. As discussed in units VI and VII of
this Notice, the benefits of continued sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks are negligible and do not outweigh
the risks. Finally, EPA has taken steps to minimize the amount of stocks that are currently in the hands of registrants,
retailers, and distributors. In December 1993, EPA notified registrants of the risks associated with the products
and asked them to stop formulating, selling, and distributing their products (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that no person may sell, distribute, or use the existing stocks of any product subject to this Notice
except for: (1) Sale or distribution up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of that product,
or (2) for lawful disposal. It is the responsibility of the basic registrants to notify any and all supplementally
registered distributors of their product(s) that this Notice also applies to their supplementally registered products.
Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by their distributors. Any sale, distribution, or use of
existing stocks of canceled products other than as provided in this Notice will be considered a violation of FIFRA
12(a)(2)(J). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, the distribution or sale of canceled products will be allowed
if such distribution or sale is for the purpose of collecting products for relabeling, reformulation, disposal,
or export to a country where the use of simazine is not prohibited, or any other lawful purpose not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Notice. In order for exported existing stocks of canceled simazine to qualify for this exception,
such stocks must comply with all the labeling requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(1)(a) and the foreign purchaser
acknowledgement requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(a)(2). In order to be considered to be in compliance
with these provisions, the exporter must follow the procedures specified in the EPA's Export Policy and Procedures
for Exporting Unregistered Pesticides at 40 CFR part 168, subpart D.

Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g), any producer or exporter, registrant, applicant for a registration, applicant or
holder of an experimental use permit, commercial applicator, or any person who distributes or sells any pesticide,
who possesses any stocks of pesticide products containing simazine subject to this Notice that are canceled by a final
order issued either in the absence of or following a hearing on cancellation (hereafter, referred to as ``affected
persons,'' which includes affected individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, or any organized
group of persons whether incorporated or not) must notify the EPA and appropriate State and local officials of: (1)
Such possession; (2) the quantity of canceled simazine pesticide product possessed; and, (3) the place at which the
canceled simazine pesticide product is stored. Notification by affected persons to EPA and designated State and
local officials pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g) shall be in accordance with the procedures, time frames, and requirements
set out in this Unit. End users, except commercial applicators, are not required to report their stocks of canceled
simazine products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registrations of Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;32),
Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124&hyph;93), Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;33), Algicil
Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432&hyph;54), and any products with these registration numbers that are supplementally distributed.
This action is taken pursuant to authority in section 6(b) of FIFRA. Under FIFRA section 6(b)(1), registrants and
other adversely affected parties may request a hearing on the cancellation actions that this Notice initiates. Any
hearing concerning cancellation of the registration for any affected pesticide product will be held in accordance
with FIFRA section 6(d). Unless a hearing is properly requested in accordance with the provisions of this Notice,
the registrations will be canceled. This unit of the Notice explains how such persons may request a hearing in accordance
with the procedures specified in this Notice, and the consequences of requesting or failing to request a hearing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 15, 1991 (56 FR 40614), stating that temporary tolerances had been renewed for the combined residues of the
herbicide triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid) and its metabolites 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol
and 2-methoxy-3,5,6-trichloropyridine in or on the raw agricultural commodities rice grain at 0.5 part per million
(ppm) and rice straw at 8.0 ppm, and for triclopyr in poultry meat, poultry fat, and meat byproducts (except kidney)
at 0.2 ppm, poultry kidney at 1.0 ppm and eggs at 0.3 ppm. These tolerances are renewed in response to pesticide petition
(PP) 8G3571, submitted by DowElanco, 9002 Purdue Rd., P.O. Box 681428, Indianapolis, IN 46268. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The company has requested a 1&hyph;year renewal of the temporary tolerances to permit the continued marketing of
the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit
62719-EUP-8, which is being renewed under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended
(Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated,
and it was determined that renewal of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary
tolerances have been renewed on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit
and with the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. DowElanco must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety.
The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available
to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These tolerances expire June 23, 1995. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the above raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on
this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Water soluble packaging (WSP), which usually consists of polyvinyl alcohol, is used to package certain powdered
formulations of pesticides to minimize exposure to pesticide handlers via inhalation. EPA is proposing to streamline
the registration requirements for WSP to encourage use of such ``reduced risk'' packaging. Under the proposed policy,
EPA will register WSP along with other forms of packaging under one registration number under the following conditions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The confidential statement of formula (CSF) must list the chemical name(s), trade name(s), supplier(s), CAS Registry
number(s), and amount(s) of components of the polyvinyl alcohol film and printing ink(s). All WSP components must
have been previously cleared and not listed as ingredients to the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The ``Directions For Use'' on the label must provide mixing directions in terms of WSP packages to be added per unit
volume of water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To add WSP to an existing registration, a registrant would notify EPA by submitting a letter certifying compliance
with the PR Notice, and enclosing two copies of the CSF and one copy of the revised label.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In September 1992, EPA released a commissioned study entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Influence of CBI Requirements on TSCA CBI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (the ``study''). The study was commissioned as part of an EPA initiative to improve TSCA's utilization as a toxics
information dissemination statute. The study provided an in depth analysis of CBI claims, submitter procedures
for making such claims, EPA review and challenges of claims, and effects of CBI claims on information which is not eligible
for confidential treatment by the standards established in TSCA and its implementing regulations, including 40
CFR part 2, on EPA's toxics information mission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After releasing the study, EPA has met with a variety of state, environmental, labor, and industry groups. In addition,
EPA conducted a public meeting regarding the study. EPA carefully considered the recommendations provided in the
study and the comments it has received from the public. Based in part on the recommendations and comments received,
EPA formulated a working paper entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Actions to Reform TSCA Confidential Business Information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (the ``proposal'') discussing the issues raised by EPA, the study, and the various comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency conducted a second public meeting after the release of the proposal. Again EPA has received many comments.
Based on the recommendations and comments received, EPA developed the final paper entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Action Plan: TSCA Confidential Business Information Reform
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The paper is available from the TSCA Hot Line at the location listed under the ADDRESSES unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following are components of the Final Action Plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Educational efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Toxics information dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. State programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Regulatory policy clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CBI review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Industry voluntary information dissemination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Regulatory changes: sunset provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Regulatory changes: senior management official signing CBI claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Regulatory changes: upfront substantiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the comments received in the various stages of the policy development process, various other relevant documents
and the transcripts of the public meetings have been incorporated into a public case file. This case file, No. 00125A,
is available for inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center located at EPA headquarters, Rm. NE&hyph;B607,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

 Section 73.1680 requires that licensees of AM, FM or TV stations submit an informal request to the FCC (within 24 hours
of commencement of use) to continue operation with an emergency antenna. An emergency antenna is one that is erected
for temporary use after the authorized main and auxiliary antennas are damaged and cannot be used. The data is used
by FCC staff to ensure that interference is not caused to other existing stations.

On September 30, 1991, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Illinois (Region 13). On June 6, 1994, Region
13 submitted a proposed amendment to its plan that would revise the current channel allotments. Because the proposed
amendment is a major change to the Region 13 plan, the Commission is soliciting comments from the public before taking
action. (See Report and Order, General Docket No. 87&hyph;112, 3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before August 4, 1994 and reply comments on or
before August 19, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554 and should clearly identify them as submission to PR Docket 91&hyph;228 Illinois-Public
Safety Region 13.

<DOCTITLE>Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany; Application to engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Bank), has applied pursuant to  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company
Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage
in various activities through Deutsche Bank Sharps Pixley, Inc. (DBSPI) and Sharps Pixley Brokers, Inc. (``Brokers''),
both of New York, New York, which were acquired indirectly by Deutsche Bank from Kleinwort Benson Group plc, London,
England on December 31, 1993. Deutsche Bank proposes to engage in the following activities through DBSPI: (1) trading
for its own account for nonhedging purposes in gold, silver and platinum bullion in the spot, forward and over-the-counter

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form.

the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank states that the Board previously has determined by Regulation that certain of the proposed activities,
when conducted within limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and
orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(1) and Westpac
Banking Corporation, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 61 (1987) (making, acquiring or servicing loans or other extensions
of credit); 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(18) and (19) (providing FCM transactional and advisory services with respect to
bullion contracts). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank also maintains that the Board has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities,
when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking.

in conformity with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank further states that the Board previously has not approved trading platinum bullion in the spot market
for a bank holding company's own account, or trading gold, silver or platinum bullion in the forward or OTC option market
for a bank holding company's own account for nonhedging purposes. With respect to trading gold and silver in the forward
and OTC option markets, Deutsche Bank maintains that the Board previously has determined that trading for nonhedging
purposes in the proposed derivative contracts with respect to other bank-eligible investments is closely related
to banking, and, therefore, that trading these contracts with respect to silver and gold bullion also is closely related
to banking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to its proposal that Company trade for its own account in platinum bullion, Deutsche Bank states that
the OCC and the New York State Banking Department have approved this activity for banks under their respective jurisdictions.
Deutsche Bank also states that the Board has approved under  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act the purchase and sale of platinum
coins, under limited circumstances.

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 552 (1990). Deutsche Bank maintains that for these reasons, the proposed trading in
platinum bullion is closely related to banking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by DBSPI and
Brokers ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deutsche Bank believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Deutsche Bank maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Deutsche Bank to offer
its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Deutsche Bank states that the proposed activities will not
result in the adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts
of interest, or unsound banking practices.

In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice

and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.

Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than July 31, 1994. Any request for a

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, Marion
Merrell Dow to license its dicyclomine formulations and production technology to a third party, and to contract manufacture
dicyclomine for the third party while that party awaits the Food and Drug Administration approval to sell its own dicyclomine.
The consent agreement also would prohibit future acquisition of any dicyclomine manufacturing, production or distribution
capabilities without prior Commission approval.

persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.

On October 4, 1993, MMD and Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby'') signed an agreement whereby MMD acquired
all of the stock of Rugby's generic pharmaceutical business. The proposed compliant alleges that the acquisition
violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45,
in the market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by establishing a new entrant into the U.S. market for
dicyclomine capsules and tablets to replace the competition lost as a result of the acquisition. The proposed Consent
Order would require MMD to enter into an agreement with a potential new entrant within twelve (12) months from the date
the proposed Consent Order becomes final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agreement would require MMD to manufacture and supply dicyclomine, as well as to license the relevant dicyclomine
technology, to a Commission approved potential new entrant. MMD must continue to supply the potential new entrant
with dicyclomine until the potential new entrant has begun manufacturing dicyclomine with FDA approval, or for seven
(7) years, whichever is shorter. The price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential new entrant
may not exceed 48 percent of the Average Wholesale Price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993. The potential new entrant
must certify its good faith intention and actual plan to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine capsules
and tablets for sale in the U.S. In the event that MMD fails to enter into such an agreement with a potential new entrant,
or that the potential new entrant discontinues or fails in its efforts to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine
within seven (7) years, the proposed Consent Order provides that MMD shall consent to the appointment of a trustee
by the Commission. The trustee will be responsible for locating a potential new entrant that will obtain the necessary
approvals and sell dicyclomine into the U.S. market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Order will also prohibit for a period of ten (10) years, Dow and MMD from acquiring any interest in assets
used for the development, manufacture or sale of dicyclomine without prior approval from the Commission. The proposed
Order will also require MMD to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the provisions of the Order
within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until the
Commission has approved a potential new entrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Dow and MMD will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Dow
or MMD to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Dow or MMD resulting
in the emergence of a successor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Today, the Commission accepts for comment a consent agreement settling charges that Marion Merrell Dow's consummated
acquisition of certain stock in the Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. would substantially lessen competition in
the United States market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets. I support the allegations in the complaint
that the acquisition created a monopoly in the manufacture and sale of dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets,
and I have reason to believe the acquisition violated the law. I dissent because I find the remedy insufficient. Ideally,
the Commission would have sought to enjoin the transaction. Although it did not seek a preliminary injunction, the
Commission still should seek through administrative litigation divestiture of assets sufficient to create a viable,
independent dicyclomine business. Administrative litigation takes time but affords a much higher likelihood of
obtaining effective relief by divestiture of an ongoing enterprise than does a technology license designed to induce
new entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order requires Marion Merrell Dow to grant a nonexclusive license to certain intangible dicyclomine assets,
including patents and technology, and for up to seven years to sell to the person acquiring the license dicyclomine
tablets and capsules at a price not exceeding 48 percent of the average wholesale price on July 2, 1993. Technology
licenses tend to be highly regulatory and less effective than divestitures in restoring competition. Further, because
of the great difficulty government agencies have in specifying competitive market prices, it is highly questionable
whether requiring sales of dicyclomine at a Commission-specified maximum price will provide consumers with interim
relief from the monopoly. Indeed, since the Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting
period on July 12, 1993, it seems entirely possible that the price on July 2 reflected the impending merger to monopoly
and was already supra-competitive.

The Commission is accepting for public comment a proposed consent agreement with Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (``MMD''),
the manufacturer of Bentyl, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders.
In October 1993, MMD acquired Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby''), a manufacturer of numerous pharmaceutical
products, including a generic version of Bentyl: dicyclomine hydrochloride. The proposed complaint alleges, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that this acquisition ``created a monopoly in the manufacture of dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets.''
Complaint &para;&sect;VIII(c). I am writing separately in order to explain one aspect of my analysis of this case,
and to raise some questions concerning the proposed remedy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A threshold issue in analyzing this merger is whether MMD's Bentyl and Rugby's generic dicyclomine are in the same
product market. On the one hand, it may seem obvious that two drugs deemed to be bio-equivalent by the Food and Drug Administration,
must be in the same relevant product market. On the other hand, branded drugs and their generic counterparts typically
vary dramatically in price, suggesting that consumers may not view the products as equivalent or interchangeable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the Merger Guidelines, the Commission approaches the issue of market definition by asking what products,
if any, constrained the price of MMD's Bentyl (and Rugby's generic dicyclomine) at the time of the merger. If, in response
to a small but significant increase in the price of Bentyl, enough customers would switch to generic dicyclomine (or,
if in response to a small but significant increase in the price of generic dicyclomine, enough customers would switch
to Bentyl) to make the price increase unprofitable, then the two products are deemed to be in the same market. Whether
a particular branded drug and any generic versions are in the same market may vary over time, and depends in part upon
their relative prices at the time of the merger. In general, where the price differential between the branded product
and the generic product is great, the products are more likely to be in separate markets.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Conversely, where the price gap between the branded product and the generic product is relatively small (for example,
where there is only one generic version available to consumers), the products are more likely to be in the same market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This price differential may be greatest where there is intense price competition among different generic versions
of a drug. In this situation, the branded drug may not serve as a significant constraint on the price of the generic versions;
that is, a five or ten percent increase in the (very low) price of the generic drugs would not be defeated by sales lost
to the (much higher priced) branded drug. And in this situation, the next best substitute for the branded drug (from
the perspective of those consumers who are uninterested in low priced generics) may be another branded drug. Under
the Merger Guidelines, the branded and generic drugs may then be viewed as occupying separate product markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed consent agreement aims to establish a new competitor in the U.S. dicyclomine market to replace the competition
lost as a result of MMD's allegedly illegal acquisition. Specifically, MMD is required to license certain dicyclomine
production technology to a Commission-approved licensee that avows a good faith intention to obtain FDA approval
to independently manufacture dicyclomine for sale in the United States. Further, MMD must supply dicyclomine to
the potential new entrant for up to seven years, until such time as the licensee has begun manufacturing dicyclomine
on its own.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I am concerned about the terms of this Commission-mandated supply agreement. The proposed consent order provides
that the price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential entrant may not exceed 48 percent of
the average wholesale price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 This is in effect a form of government price regulation, and is apt to result in a significant misallocation of resources.
It is particularly troubling that the maximum transfer price is fixed by the Commission's order for up to seven years,
and (unlike market-based prices) does not vary with either changes in demand or changes in the costs of production.
If the costs of production come to exceed the transfer price, then the licensee may have an incentive to delay the opening
of its own production facility, and hence delay the return of true, market-based competition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
My view, based upon the evidence assembled during this investigation, is that the July 2, 1993 price did not reflect
the exercise of any market power gained as a result of the then impending MMD/Rugby transaction, but reflected other
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the fixed transfer price may actually be in effect for longer than seven years. For example, if the original
licensee fails after seven years to obtain FDA approval, then a replacement licensee may be selected by a trustee.
This second licensee is entitled to purchase dicyclomine from MMD at the same fixed price. Given the Commission's
recent experience in the

 (Docket No. 9228) matters, the prospect of another seemingly interminable and complicated compliance proceeding
disturbs me. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I hope that during the public comment period the Commission will receive advice on the wisdom and workability of the
proposed supply agreement. In particular, I am interested in considering alternate ways of structuring the price
term. Is there a practical way, under a revised order, to permit the price term to vary should the costs of production
or demand vary?
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Or would the uncertainties of future cost and demand changes be better accomodated if MMD and the licensee were free
to negotiate a price term (perhaps subject to Commission approval)? Finally, what is the optimal duration for the
supply agreement? Specifically, how long should it take a licensee, acting diligently, to obtain required FDA approvals
and commence manufacturing dicyclomine? At this time, I am not confident that the appropriate maximum duration for
the MMD supply agreement should be as long as seven years. Public comment on these issues may be of significant value
to the Commission not only in this matter, but more generally as the agency seeks to devise effective antitrust remedies
for the pharmaceutical, and other industries.

I voted to accept for public comment the proposed consent agreement in this matter because I believe it represents
a viable solution to the potential anticompetitive effects that resulted from Marion Merrell Dow's (``MMD'') acquisition
of Rugby Holding, Inc. (``Rugby''). The acquisition created a monopoly in the market for dicyclomine tablets and
capsules by combining the only two manufacturers of the branded and generic product. The proposed consent has the
potential of establishing a second competitor through the grant of a nonexclusive license by MMD of certain intangible
dicyclomine assets. The order also sets a maximum price at which MMD is allowed to sell dicyclomine tablets and capsules
to the licensee for up to seven years. The goal is to replace the competition lost from the dicyclomine market as quickly
as possible by establishing a new entrant in the market. The order is the best mechanism to provide quick relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order sets a ceiling of 48% of the average wholesale price on July 2, 1993, as the maximum price at which MMD is allowed
to sell dicyclomine tablet and capsules to the licensee. The July 2, 1993, wholesale price offers the best available
approximation of the price that would exist in a market consisting of only one manufacturer of the branded and one manufacturer
of the generic product. The 48% is based on our best approximation of the margin that a generic distributor of another
manufacturer's product needs to make a profit. Furthermore, the July 2 price is the firs price increase that reflected
the exit of two generic competitors. The timing of the merger announcement and the price increase could suggest that
the price on July 2nd were also influenced by the impending merger; however there is no evidence of this. If the ceiling
is higher than one would prefer, the licensee and licensor could conceivably arrive at a transfer price that somewhat
reduces their incentives to fully compete. Unfortunately, there is no other non-arbitrary method for setting the
maximum allowable price, nor would it be easy to determine such a price. The provision, however, does serve the basic
purpose of providing the licensee a chance to succeed without injecting a regulator's version of competition into
the market.

would be in effect.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I have a mild concern that the licensee will not have sufficient incentives to begin manufacturing dicyclomine on
its own under the order. A potential licensee could enter the licensing agreement for a short period of time with the
intention of taking advantage of the profit available for selling the licensed product but without the intention
of manufacturing dicyclomine on its own. Alternatively, a licensee might initially intend to elf-manufacture,
but change its strategy at some later date and sell only the licensed product.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In this particular instance, no reasonable fixes to the licensee incentive problem seem available. Therefore, on
balance, I support the order because, at a minimum, it should achieve the necessary intermediate relief. Permanent
relief, such as divestiture, may not be as needed in this instance because there is a good possibility of future entry,
albeit untimely.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Macy's Northeast, Inc., Macy's
South, Inc., Macy's California, Inc., and Bullock's, Inc. (``proposed respondents''), wholly-owned subsidiaries
of R.H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. Proposed respondents operate department stores in New York, California, and a number
of other states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that the proposed respondents have violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission
(16 CFR 702.3(a)) pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. 2301). This Rule requires the proposed
respondents to make manufacturers' warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the
Rule, are to improve the information available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in
the marketing of consumer product warranties offered by manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either (1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or (2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that the proposed respondents have not complied with either of these options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to comply with this Rule, to inform their retail store executives
of their compliance responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing their sales personnel about the availability
and location of manufacturers' warranty information. Proposed respondents will be subject to civil penalties if
they do not comply with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois (``Wards''). Wards is a national chain of retail department stores, and of specialty
stores selling appliances and consumer electronics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that Wards has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a))
pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;2301). This Rule requires Wards to maker manufacturers'
warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information
available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties
offered by manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either 1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or 2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that Wards has not complied with either of these options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires Wards to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance
responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location
of manufacturers' warranty information. Wards will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,
Hoffman Estates, Illinois (``Sears''). Sears is a national chain of retail department stores. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that Sears has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a))
pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;2301). This Rule requires Sears to make manufacturers'
warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information
available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties
offered by manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either (1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or (2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that Sears has not complied with either of these options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires Sears to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance
responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location
of manufacturers' warranty information. Sears will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Services Administration proposes to acquire a site and develop a new U.S. Courthouse consisting of approximately
800,000 gross square feet. The new facility will consolidate the district court and court-related agencies which
are currently housed in six different Government-owned and leased locations. Although the proposed building will
initially accommodate the projected 10-year space requirements of the courts, the site to be acquired will be of sufficient
size to allow for its expansion beyond that timeframe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing U.S. Courthouse in Cleveland was constructed in 1910 and is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. It contains a gross area of approximately 250,000 square feet and currently houses the district court, the
bankruptcy court and the U.S. court of appeals. Due to the significant expansion of the recent years, several court-related
tenants have been relocated into approximately 127,000 square feet of leased space. The proposed new courthouse
will, with the exception of two senior district judges, consolidate the entire direct court family and related agencies
in one building. The existing U.S. Courthouse will be retained, and will house two senior district judges and the bankruptcy
court. The EIS will evaluate alternative sites for the proposed facility, as well as the no-build alternative. The
EIS will also evaluate impacts on the affected environment for resource areas including geology and soils, air and
noise quality, cultural resources, land us, community services, traffic and transportation, hazardous materials,
economics and aesthetics

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Infectious Diseases, announces the opportunity
for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the further
development, refinement, and validation of three interrelated technologies: (1) The Exchangeable Template Reaction
(ETR), a method to assemble synthetic genes, (2) the construction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) specific ``mosaic''
proteins composed of immunodominant antigenic epitopes, and (3) differential HCV diagnostic tests. It is anticipated
that these and any new technologies or inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be licensed to the collaborator
with whom the CRADA is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful,
marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research.
The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may
provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange:
CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication
of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds
this necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The goal of this CRADA is to bring to market HCV-specific technologies that will improve public health. CDC will provide
intellectual insight and experimental design protocols to: (1) Improve the efficiency of ETR, (2) construct ``mosaic''
proteins for HCV that have immunodiagnostic and potential vaccine relevance, and (3) evaluate synthetic peptides
containing antigenic epitopes as reagents to discriminate recent from late infections or that may predict outcome
of HCV infection. CDC will design and conduct feasibility experiments for each of the project areas and will contribute
in the preparation of serologic panels to validate various test formats. The CRADA partner will prepare all synthetic
peptides and oligonucleotides as necessary for each project area, prepare monospecific and monoclonal antibodies
whenever appropriate, and purify antigens from recombinant lysates as needed. The collaborator will utilize its
expertise in market research to evaluate the commercialization of the technologies.

in the CRADA. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent will develop the final research plan in collaboration with CDC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant submissions will be judged according to the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Evidence of commitment and ability to develop innovative designs for diagnostic assays and/or vaccines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Evidence of preparing synthetic peptides and oligonucleotides; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Evidence of a strong engineering department to design automated equipment; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Evidence of an existing infrastructure to commercialize on successful technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This CRADA is proposed and implemented under the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act, Public Law 99&hyph;502 (15

Approximately $250,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund three cooperative agreements. It is expected that the
awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period
of up to five years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to develop data collection networks and to provide information about
the practice of laboratory medicine in hospital, physician office and independent laboratories. This cooperative
agreement will ultimately improve patient care by improving the quality of clinical laboratory medicine and increase
the availability of laboratory monitoring networks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipients will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for those activities under B. (CDC Activities). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Recipient Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Solicit laboratories to voluntarily participate in the Monitoring Networks so that sufficient representatives
of each laboratory type (hospital, physician office, and independent) participate in the total network by the end
of the first year of operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide leadership in the design and evaluation of questionnaires for periodic reporting of laboratory operational
characteristics and problems, especially those that impact patient care and on methods that are used by the network
participants during the period of the study. Topics investigated by the questionnaires and the time period of monitoring
may change during the cooperative agreement by mutual consent of both network participants and CDC. The actual monitoring
areas will be decided after the award of the cooperative agreement(s) and may differ for each of the laboratory groups.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questionnaires should also capture information that determines the effectiveness of actions being taken by
participants to improve the practice of laboratory medicine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Provide leadership in collecting and sharing raw data both within the network and with CDC. Participant identification
information may be omitted from these data sets if the network manager(s) is able to respond to questions concerning
the validity of entered data without providing participant identification information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Periodically send the developed questionnaires to network participants for them to gather and submit the response
data back. The network manager will then enter, analyze, and summarize the data for the participants in a statistically
valid manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Prepare manuscripts for peer-review publications, as appropriate, that describe the results of one or more of
the activities listed above. Manuscripts should benefit the public good. All manuscripts would note the nature of
the funding for the project.

Purpose
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
: The purpose of this open meeting is to review and discuss a NIOSH project entitled, ``Control of Occupational Exposures
during Construction.'' Peer reviewers will give their individual review comments and suggestions regarding the
scope of the study. Historically, many exposures related to construction have gone unquantified and uncontrolled.
The objective of this project is to provide the construction industry with information concerning practical, effective
engineering controls and work methods which minimize worker exposures to process-generated air contaminants.
The initial phases of this project will focus on drywall sanding and roofing kettles. Viewpoints and suggestions
from industry, labor, academia, other government agencies, and the public are invited.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The grant application process for FY 1994 will consist of a one-stage, full application. Applications are limited
to 20 single- or 40 double-spaced pages (excluding resumes, forms, etc.) and must relate to the selection criteria
established for review of applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority areas in this announcement permit applicants to propose research efforts from 12 to 24 months in duration.
In item 11 of the Face Sheet (page 1 of form SSA&hyph;96&hyph;BK) indicate the priority area under which the application
is submitted, i.e., ORS&hyph;94&hyph;001, ORS&hyph;94&hyph;002, etc.

Part II. Priority Research Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, the following projects will be considered for funding: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Economic Circumstances of Aged Widows_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;001 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A high proportion of the elderly who are economically vulnerable are widowed women. Although as a group they experience
one of the highest rates of poverty, approximately three-quarters of widows aged 65 or older are not poor. Data from
the SIPP provide an opportunity to understand the economic circumstances of aged widows and to identify those factors
that are associated with their late-life poverty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals are sought for SIPP-based research that conducts two types of analyses of the poverty of aged widows. The
first of these tasks is to provide a comprehensive description of the personal, financial, and environmental characteristics
of poor elderly widows. These characteristics will include details of income amounts and specific sources, assets,
personal and household characteristics (e.g., age, race, education, work history, fertility history, welfare
recipiency history, health status, urban vs rural location, age at which widowhood occurred). This descriptive
material should compare and contrast the incidence of poverty and its circumstances for aged widows with similar
measures for single elderly women who have never married, aged married women, and, where sample size permits, elderly
divorced women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second task is to simulate the resulting economic scenario for married women aged 65 or older in the event of the
death of their husbands. This will involve projecting the time path of income and assets for the widow, given the couple's
economic circumstances at time of the SIPP interviews. The hypothetical widow's income should be based on Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income program rules, any pension income she has earned in her own right, whether
a husband with public or private pension rights has elected a survivor's option, asset income, the couple's life insurance
holdings, and so forth. It is expected that, where possible, the economic status of the couple prior to the husband's
death will be related to factors such as lifetime work experience of each spouse, current health status and health
insurance coverage, etc. In addition, various scenarios for asset decumulation associated with health expenditures
brought on by the husband's death might be introduced to account for reduced assets subsequently available to the
surviving spouse [See Linda Del Bene and Denton R. Vaughan, ``Income, Assets and Health Insurance: Economic Resources
for Meeting Acute Health Care Needs of the Aged,'' Social Security Bulletin, Spring 1992]. We are interested in learning
how the economic status of aged widows compares with their circumstances prior to the husband's death, whether particular
background factors can be used to predict which married women are particularly at risk of poverty in their old age,
and how the incomes and assets of widows change as the duration of widowhood increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year
funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that an amount up to $100,000 will be allocated to fund one project under this priority area for the
initial 12-month budget period.

B. Selected Economic and Demographic Assumptions Used to Project the Financial Status of the OASDI Trust Funds_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;002

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal OASDI Trust Funds contain long-range, 75-year projections
on the financial status of the trust funds. The assumptions and methodology underlying those projections were reviewed
by the Panel of Technical Experts (the Panel) convened by the quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security and
recommendations for research were made. (The ``Social Security Technical Panel Report to the 1991 Advisory Council
on Social Security'' and its appendices were reprinted in the November and December 1990 issues of the Social Security
Bulletin.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address some of the Panel's recommendations for research, the principal topics of this priority are to better understand:
(i) the determinants of changes in productivity and earnings, and how to develop better methods of projecting future
productivity and earnings; (ii) the determinants of nominal and real interest rates and of how to project them; (iii)
the determinants of fertility and how to project future fertility rates; (iv) the determinants of mortality and how
to project future mortality rates; (v) the analysis of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
illegal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 immigration and how to project such immigration; and (vi) the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost
projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on productivity and earnings are: What are the determinants of linkages between
productivity and earnings, particularly hours of work and fringe benefits? What are the effects of the changing quality
(including the question of measuring quality) and demographic mix of the labor force? What are the effects of research
and development by both the public and the private sectors? What are the effects of capital formation by the public
sector (e.g., public infrastructure) and by the private sector? What is the effect of the increasing integration
of U.S. and foreign markets? Are there analytical methods or strategies for selecting which averaging periods are
most appropriate in determining the various economic assumptions? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between
productivity and earnings and other economic and demographic factors? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on nominal and real interest rates are: To what extent can the current structure
of interest rates be used to predict future interest rates? What are the determinants of inflation and are there analytical
methods for projecting future inflation rates? What strategies are optimal for incorporating both historical and
current interest rate information into the projections? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between nominal
and real interest rates and other economic and demographic variables? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on fertility patterns in this priority area are: What are the determinants of fertility
and changes in fertility? What is the relationship between age at first birth and the total fertility rate? How do birth
rates of immigrants and of their children compare with those of non-immigrants and their children? Will future trends
in fertility rates by race and ethnic group mirror past trends? For assumptions used in projecting fertility, can
an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how much
weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among those questions to be addressed on mortality are: What are the determinants of mortality and rates of change
in mortality? What evidence is there for projecting changes in mortality for specific causes (e.g., cancer, heart,
etc.) based on changes in smoking, nutrition, and other lifestyle patterns? For assumptions used in projecting mortality,
can an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how
much weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be addressed on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
illegal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
immigrants are: Estimates of current numbers, labor-force participation rates, and rates of immigration of illegal
immigrants; analysis of factors likely to affect future immigration rates of illegal immigrants and projections
based on this analysis; the length of coverage and average earnings of illegal immigrants and the length of time they
remain in the country; and the extent to which illegal immigrants receive benefits based upon their coverage under
the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the questions to be asked with respect to the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost projections
are: Although theoretically, the current low-cost and high-cost projections represent a collection of extreme
values for each of the variables, how should these bounds be interpreted_as absolute bounds on what could possibly
happen, as confidence levels, as illustrative alternative projections, or as sensitivity analyses? (Attention
should be given to the way in which rates of inflation are incorporated into the low-cost and high-cost projections.)
Should the projections incorporate interrelationships among the economic and demographic variables (for example,
among others, interactions among fertility, marital status, labor force participation, and birth expectations),
and if so, which interrelationships are critical, and how should they be incorporated?

C. Issues Related to the Scheduled Increase in the Retirement Age_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98&hyph;21) provide for a gradual increase in the age at which unreduced
retired-workers benefits are first payable (for brevity, the retirement age) from 65 to 67 between the years 2000
and 2027. Benefits for retired workers still will be available at age 62, but the amount payable will be gradually reduced
from the currently payable 80 percent of the unreduced benefit to 70 percent. It has further been proposed to speed
up the phase-in to a higher retirement age, and to increase the retirement age to 68 (70 in one proposal). At least one
proposal also increases the early retirement age to 65. (The executive summary of the report mandated by Congress
and consultant reports were reprinted in the October 1986 and February 1987 issues of the Social Security Bulletin.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The increase in retirement age is based on the assumption that the increase in life expectancy has been accompanied
by a corresponding improvement in health and capacity to work. But past studies are inconclusive about the relationship
between longevity and work ability, especially among persons in their sixties. Proposals are sought to further investigate
these relationships, using either new approaches, more current data, and/or new databases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One possible approach would be to use microdata collected by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine
trends in health and ability to work. Data should be presented for subgroups of major interest for the retirement age
issue (both early and normal retirement), subject to sampling error problems. A wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of variables that measure health and ability to work should be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The retirement-age increase may also impact on the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. Studies
are needed to address questions such as: (i) what is the expected impact on the number of DI beneficiaries and their
duration on the rolls and on the DI Trust Fund; (ii) how many workers would qualify for DI benefits at age 65 and 66 and
how many would elect to receive benefits; and (iii) among those aged 62&hyph;64 who do not now elect to apply for DI benefits,
how many might do so because of the additional reduction in benefits for early retirement that accompanies a retirement-age
increase (including the elimination in some proposals of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding
not to exceed 17 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This project is intended to encourage research with the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS) developed by SSA over the
past decade to study the changing circumstances of aged and disabled beneficiaries. Based initially on a survey of
new beneficiaries at the beginning of the 1980's, the dataset has been expanded with information from administrative
records (on benefits, covered earnings, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicare) and followup interviews with
survivors from the original survey. With the exception of the Medicare records, all administrative data have been
obtained both for respondents and spouses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original sample contained representative samples of new Social Security beneficiaries who filed for benefits
as retired workers, disabled workers, wives, widows, divorced wives, and surviving divorced wives. There was also
a representative sample of persons aged 65 and over who were entitled to Medicare benefits but who had not yet received
Social Security cash benefits. The aged sample was, for the most part, in its mid- to late-60's in 1982 and in its mid-
to late-70's in 1991. Some of the sample members were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the ``notch'' that was created when legislation was enacted to correct for an overcompensation in the
benefit formula for inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original interview covered a wide range of topics, including demographic characteristics, marital and childbearing
history, employment history, current income (in the format of the SIPP) and assets, and health. The followup interview,
in addition to asking many of the same questions as the original interview, collected a history of critical events
since 1982 (such as widowhood or divorce, work cessation, migration, and the sale of the home) and the financial impact
of these critical events. The original health items of work disability, functional capacity, and presence of major
diseases were expanded to assess specific Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living,
private health insurance provisions, and the longest experience in a long-term care facility. Disabled workers
who returned to work were asked about their job search experience, employer accommodations to their disability,
and their use of vocational and rehabilitation services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background material and a compilation of reports based on the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey are available. These reports
were also published in various editions of the Social Security Bulletin from 1983 to 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the NBDS, the following projects will be considered for funding:

1. Understanding How Aged Beneficiaries Become Poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although poverty rates among the aged have declined substantially over the last 30 years, there are still some troublesome
problems and poverty among aged women is a particular concern. Various legislative proposals have been made or discussed
to improve the treatment of women under the Social Security program, including care-giving credits, increasing
benefits at some age, eliminating the actuarial reduction for early benefit receipt at some age, modifying the Social
Security special minimum benefit, and redesigning couple benefits in order to enhance survivor benefits. However,
many of the proposals are not well targeted to the poor. Proposals for research are sought to increase our understanding
of why aged beneficiaries, and especially aged women, become poor, which will improve our ability to form policy in
this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the key research questions are: To what extent is aged poverty a continuation of a lifetime of low income? To
what extent is aged poverty a result of aged couples decumulating assets as they age? What are the economic effects
of widowhood, including the extent to which sources of income are lost or reduced, and the extent to which high health
care expenditures surrounding the death of a spouse are a major cause of high poverty rates among the aged who have become
widowed? Is the type of social security benefit received (retired worker benefits, wife or widow benefits, worker
benefits that are supplemented because of entitlement to a higher spouse or survivor benefit and those that are not,
retirement benefits that were converted from a disability benefit at age 65 and those that were not) related to differing
poverty rates in 1982, and are those patterns the same among beneficiaries 10 years later? How different is the role
of major sources of income (including social security, other pensions, asset income, earnings, and Supplemental
Security Income_an SSA-administered ``safety net'' program) in 1991 than it was in 1982?

2. Changing Economic Status of Individuals With Disabilities and Their Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We know that newly disabled individuals in 1982 were less well-off than newly retired individuals in terms of both
income and assets. However, little or no research has been done to follow disabled individuals over time to determine
whether they have particular problems maintaining an adequate standard of living. The well-being of many individuals
with disabilities depends not only on their own income but also on the income and/or services provided by family members,
such as the earnings of spouses, or help with activities of daily living that may mean the difference between living
in the community and having to be institutionalized.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the questions to be addressed are: How adequate are the income and assets of individuals with disabilities just
after benefit receipt and 10 years later? To what extent do disabled individuals maintain their economic status over
this period of time? What factors are associated with changes in economic status over the period? How do family members
affect the economic status of disabled workers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analyses should include background factors (such as demographic characteristics, previous occupational characteristics
and earnings, living arrangements, family characteristics, and health conditions), major changes in life circumstances
(such as widowhood or divorce, changes in living arrangements, or a spouse changing hours of work or retiring), sources
of income, changes in the health status, and health-care costs and how these factors relate to various economic outcomes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals should identify the expected methods of analysis, the possible variables to be considered, and the logic
for inclusion. Application may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for the initial 12-month budget
period under this priority area.

E. Documenting and Explaining SIPP-CPS Differences in Aged Poverty Rates_ORS&hyph;94&hyph;005 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The official poverty measure and its three derivative statistics (poverty counts, poverty rates and poverty gaps)
are important and frequently used criteria employed in the formulation of policy and the evaluation of program outcomes
for the aged and disabled populations served by SSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve-month poverty rates based on the SIPP are somewhat lower for many population subgroups than the poverty rates
estimated from the CPS. Much of the comparison of poverty rates from the two surveys has been based on the first operational
SIPP panel (the 1984 panel) which pertained to the 1983&hyph;85 time period. In the 1984 panel context, SIPP-CPS poverty
rate differences for the aged, were, if anything, less marked than for younger age groups. Based on a review of published
poverty rate estimates based on SIPP panels for 1985&hyph;1990 and comparison to corresponding estimates based
on the CPS, it appears that a significant change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates appeared with
the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel. Key features of the change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty
rates include: 1) a modest decline in the poverty rate for all ages in the SIPP relative to the CPS; 2) a much more marked
SIPP-CPS difference in poverty rates for the aged than the nonaged (with SIPP rates for the aged ranging between 28
and 34 percent below those based on the CPS); 3) a marked attenuation of the tendency for poverty rates to increase strongly
with age among those age 65 and older in the SIPP context as compared with the CPS. Furthermore, preliminary research
conducted at SSA indicates that SIPP_CPS poverty rate differences among the aged appear to vary significantly by
sex, age, marital status, race and ethnicity; differences appear to be particularly marked for persons who are married,
white, or age 85 or older.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies are needed (1) to describe more fully the pattern of SIPP_CPS differences in poverty estimates for the aged,
and (2) to establish, if possible, the factors giving rise to the observed differences. SIPP-CPS differences should
be delineated for population subgroups defined in terms of salient characteristics such as marital status, more
broadly defined aspects of family composition, including the presence of nonaged family members, age, race and ethnicity.
Differences should, at a minimum, be characterized in terms of poverty counts, rates, and the poverty gap. Particular
attention should be given to evaluating possible differences between the two surveys in the portrayal of poverty
as it relates to increasing age. Given that the pattern of poverty by population subgroup is of particular interest,
the relatively small sample size available in single SIPP panels as compared with the CPS is likely to be of some concern.
If, as is suggested by review of published estimates, it can be shown that the basic patterns of SIPP-CPS differences
are stable across the post-1984 SIPP panels, serious consideration should be given to pooling the post-1984 panels
in order to support as detailed a subgroup analysis as is possible, given the substantially larger sample sizes available
from pooled samples. If the combining of SIPP panels seems feasible, the combined panels should be employed to support
the explanatory phase of the overall study, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After developing a plan for documenting more fully SIPP-CPS differences in the portrayal of poverty among the aged,
the grantee might discuss how the observed differences might be explained. In this regard a critical review of the
literature that has considered the differences between poverty rate estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) and the CPS might prove quite useful in generating hypotheses and in formulating empirical approaches to testing
the hypotheses. While several possible factors are likely to be suggested by this review (e.g., sample weighting,
particularly that component of the overall weighting scheme designed to deal with panel attrition; differing operationalizations
of the income unit; differing income concepts; and the quality of income data), emphasis in empirical work should
be given to the last factor, the relative quality of the income data from the two surveys. However, some attention could
also be given to the change in SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates that occurred with the introduction of the
1985 SIPP panel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The nature of each hypothesized factor to be considered and how it might cause the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences
might be described. A closely reasoned plan for empirically assessing the possible impact data quality on the differences
in SIPP-CPS poverty rates for the aged may be presented. Particular emphasis should be given to explaining the relevance
of each proposed test for clarifying the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences, notwithstanding the fact that
it may not be possible to devise fully unambiguous tests of the effects of income data quality on the observed SIPP-CPS
differences.

The prospective grantee will find it useful to consult recent work conducted by the Bureau of the Census comparing
income estimates for calendar year 1990 from the two surveys and Report no. 17, Studies in Income Distribution, for
similar material related to SIPP/CPS differences for the 1983&hyph;84 period. Recent work conducted at the Bureau
of the Census by Lamas, Tin and Eargle about the effect of attrition in the SIPP context on differences in SIPP-CPS poverty
rates should also be consulted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the level of available funding, empirical work should be limited to describing the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences
in poverty estimates (rates, counts, and gaps). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As much of the study will revolve around comparison of alternative estimates within or between survey contexts, issues
of statistical inference also need to be given careful consideration. In particular, given the results of SSA research
on the variance properties of SIPP-based estimates of the aged, standard errors for SIPP estimates should be based
on the generalized variance parameters as estimated by SSA (see the note by Bye and Gallicchio appearing in the winter
1993 Social Security Bulletin) or calculated directly from the survey file using the methods outlined in the Bye-Gallicchio
article.

(b) Evaluation Criteria. Applications which pass the screening process will be reviewed by at least three individuals.
Reviewers will score the applications, basing their scoring decisions on the criteria shown below. An unacceptable
rating on any individual criterion may render the application unacceptable. Consequently, applicants should take
care to ensure that all criteria are fully addressed in the application. Relative weights for the criteria are shown
in parentheses.

of the importance of the issues to be addressed? Does it describe how the project builds upon previous research? What
is the potential usefulness of the anticipated result and expected benefits to the target groups? What is the potential
usefulness of the proposed project for the advancement of scientific knowledge? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Project Design: (30 points) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of the problem and, if appropriate, hypotheses to be tested and/or parameters to be estimated; (c) specification
of data sources; (d) plan for data analysis, including appropriateness of statistical methods to be used; and (e)
scheduling of tasks and milestones in the progress of the project? Does the proposal describe specific plans for conducting

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Advisory Group was created by Paragraph V.A.4 of the Memorandum of Agreement and Consent Decree entered
into by the United States of America and the State of Alaska on August 27, 1991, and approved by the United States District
Court for the District of Alaska in settlement of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
United States of America v. State of Alaska, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Civil Action No. A91&hyph;081 CV. The Public Advisory Group was created to advise the Trustee Council on matters relating
to decisions on injury assessment, restoration activities, or other use of natural resources damage recoveries
obtained by the governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Trustee Council consists of representatives of the State of Alaska Attorney General; Commissioner of the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game; Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation; the Secretary
of the Interior; the Secretary of Agriculture; and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce. Appointment to the Public Advisory Group will be made by the Secretary of the Interior
with unanimous approval of the Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Advisory Group consists of 17 members representing the public at large (5 members) and the following special
interests: aquaculture, commercial fishing, commercial tourism, forest products, environmental, conservation,
local government, Native landowners, recreation users, sport hunting and fishing, subsistence, and science/academic.
Two additional ex officio non-voting members are from the Alaska State House of Representatives and the Alaska State
Senate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nominees need to submit the following information to the Trustee Council:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A biographical sketch (education, experience, address, telephone);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Information about the nominee's knowledge of the region, peoples, or principal economic and social activities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A disclosure statement of any potential conflict of interest. Public Advisory Group members and their alternates
are chosen to represent a broad range of interests. It is possible that action could be taken by the Public Advisory
Group when one or more of the members have a direct personal conflict of interest which would prejudice and call into
question the entire public process. To avoid this eventuality and to enable the Trustee Council to choose appropriate
individuals as members and/or alternates to members, it is necessary that each nominee provide the following information
with their information packet. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, please provide a brief explanation of
your answer. A yes will not necessarily preclude any nominee from being appointed to serve on the Public Advisory Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Do you, your spouse, children, any relative with whom you live or your employer have, or are you defending, a claim
filed before any court or administrative tribunal based upon damages caused by the T/V Exxon Valdez oil spill?

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice makes available to the public a summary of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the proposed Master Plan for
the Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge, located in Jasper County, Iowa. Establishment of the 8,654-acre Refuge
was approved on September 5, 1990. Federal funding for design, construction, and operation of the Refuge is provided
through appropriations by the U.S. Congress. Pursuant to Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1505.2), the Service issues this ROD upon consideration of the
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) prepared for the Proposed Action. The U.S. Department of Army, Corps
of Engineers (USCOE), acting as a cooperating agency in the preparation of the FEIS also adopts the FEIS and ROD as its
NEPA documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Notice of Availability of the FEIS was published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 23, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS evaluated alternatives for four elements of the Master Plan: habitat/wildlife emphasis, management, programs,
and facilities siting. Based upon an evaluation of the impacts of the various alternatives on the physical, biological,
social, and economic environments, the Preferred Alternative was identified. The Preferred Alternative is a balance
of several options and is comprised of the following elements:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative I.D: Restoration and reconstruction of over 7000 acres of tallgrass prairie/savanna habitat with reintroduction
of bison and elk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative II.E: Active habitat reconstruction and management to maximize environmental education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative III.C: Intermediate refuge program including indoor and outdoor environmental education programs
and facilities, a visitor center with a tour route and trail system, small laboratory facilities and overnight accommodations
for researchers; and other opportunities for interpretation and recreational public use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative IV.B: Consolidated facilities siting the visitor center, research facilities and maintenance facility
in a central campus.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other alternatives considered included: the no build alternative, creation of extensive wetland habitat for waterfowl
and fisheries, limited public use programs and facilities and active prairie reconstruction to maximize research.

Comments Received
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to preparation of the FEIS, the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on the Proposed Master Plan for
the Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge was circulated for public review and comment. Comments were received from
agencies and individuals expressing concerns about the findings of the DEIS. Issues raised in these comments included
but were not limited to the habitat reconstruction process including seed sources, the potential for habitat fragmentation,
and the reintroduction of bison and elk; the potential environmental effects of recreational facilities; the siting
of Refuge facilities to minimize environmental impacts; Section 404 permit requirements; Refuge access; and historic
resource issues. All substantive issues raised in the comments have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Service
and the USCOE either through revisions incorporated into the FEIS text or responses contained in Section 6.5 of the
FEIS. These responses are incorporated by reference into the ROD. No comments were received on the FEIS.

Findings and Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon a careful review and consideration of the impacts identified in the FEIS, results of the various studies
and surveys conducted in conjunction with the DEIS and FEIS, public comments received on the DEIS, and other relevant
factors, including the purposes for which the Refuge was established by Congress and statutory and regulatory guidance
for funding such projects, the Service, with concurrence by the USCOE, finds as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Preferred Alternative consists of the programs and facilities mentioned above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Preferred Alternative represents the best balance between provision of environmental education, interpretive,
recreational, and research facilities and programs, minimization of environmental impacts, and public and agency
concerns identified during the public participation process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Consistent with economic, social, and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable, potential
adverse environmental effects identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided by incorporating mitigative measures
as conditions of Federal funding approval and permit issuance. These measures are described in Section 4.0 of the
FEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A wetland mitigation plan providing in-kind and on-site replacement for unavoidable adverse impacts to existing
wetlands has been developed and will be implemented, resulting in no net loss of wetland habitat values over time.
Specific details regarding the mitigation plan have been developed through the Section 404 permit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No state or federally listed endangered or threatened species or their critical habitats are known to be adversely
affected by the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) No historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places are known
to be adversely affected by the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Statutory authority for the Service to fund and implement, and for the USCOE to permit, the project exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The requirements of NEPA and the implementing regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) have been satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ROD serves as the written facts and conclusions relied upon in reaching this decision. A complete copy of the ROD
is filed at the Refuge together with the other NEPA documents. For further information contact: Mr. Richard M. Birger,

Pursuant to 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(2), the railroad must file a verified notice with the Commission at least 50 days before
the abandonment or discontinuance is to be consummated. The applicant, in its verified notice, indicated a proposed
consummation date of August 4, 1994. Because the verified notice was filed June 16, 1994, consummation could not take
place prior to August 5, 1994. BN's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after
August 5, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Hughes Christiansen Co. a/k/a Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. Headquartered in Houston, TX; Amended Certification
Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The certification
notice was issued on May 17, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28429).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
investigation findings show that the correct name of the subject firm through December 31, 1992 was Hughes Christiansen
Company, Inc. In 1993, Hughes Cristiansen Company became an operating division of Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations,
Inc., and the claimants' wages were reported under an unemployment insurance (UI) tax account for Baker Hughes Oilfield
Operations, Inc., a subsidiary of Baker Hughes, Inc. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification
to properly reflect this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,603 is hereby issued as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All workers of Hughes Christiansen Company, Houston, Texas a/k/a Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., a subsidiary
of Baker Hughes, Inc., and operating at various locations in the following cited states who became totally or partially
separated from employment on or after January 11, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section
223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on April 20, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24483).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
findings show that Nu-Place and Sportette were subsidiaries of Quartet Fashions in New York. The findings show that
production at Nu-Place was integrated with the production at Sportette and Nu-Place closed in January 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports
of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification by including
the workers at Nu-Place, Inc. in Nazareth, Pennsylvania.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,618 is hereby issued as follows:

``All workers of Sportette Industries, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania and Nu-Place, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Advisory Council on Unemployment Insurance Compensation (ACUC) was established in accordance with the provisions
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act on January 24, 1992 (57 FR 40657). Public Law 102&hyph;164, the Emergency Unemployment
Compensation Act of 1991, mandated the establishment of the ACUC to evaluate the overall unemployment insurance
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACUC recently, through requests for proposals, commissioned researchers to prepare reports on a variety of topics
associated with the ACUC's deliberations on the reform of the unemployment insurance system. The purpose of this
meeting is to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the results of these research findings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Pursuant to Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 103&hyph;182) concerning
transitional adjustment assistance, hereinafter called (NAFTA&hyph;TAA), and in accordance with Section 250(a),
Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2273), the Department of Labor issued
a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA-Transitional Adjustment assistance on April 22, 1994, applicable
to workers of Valeo Climate Control Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas. The certification did not apply to workers in
the Rapid Product Development Group at the Fort Worth, Texas location of Valeo Climate Control Corporation. The Notice
will be published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification. New information from the company shows
that worker separations from the Rapid Product Development Group of the Fort Worth, Texas facility of Valeo Climate
Control Corporation were related to the shift in production from the subject plant to Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's certification is amended to include workers in the Rapid Product Development Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to NAFTA&hyph;00051 is hereby issued as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All workers of Valeo Climate Control Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas, including workers in the Rapid Product Development
Group, who become totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply
for NAFTA&hyph;TAA under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1994.''

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from June 13, 1994, through
June 23, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32226). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By August 5, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to John N. Hannon: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication
date and page number of this

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would merge Toledo Edison Company into Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. As described
in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. Therefore, the licensee uses the
nomenclature ``NEWCO'' as a temporary name of the combined operating company, and will provide the permanent name
by supplemental letter. The amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company with ``NEWCO'' as a licensee, (2) designate ``NEWCO'' as the owner of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1,
and (3) make other administrative changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior Service
Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supporting qualification report for the subject criteria demonstrates that the presence of the tubesheet will
enhance the tube integrity in the region of the tube-to-tubesheet roll expansions by precluding tube deformation
beyond its initial expanded outside diameter. The resistance to a tube rupture is strengthened by the presence of
the tubesheet in that region. The results of hardrolling of the tube into the tubesheet provides a mechanical leak
limiting seal between the tube and the tubesheet. A tube rupture cannot occur because the contact between the tube
and the tubesheet does not permit sufficient movement of tube material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of degradation for which the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria has been developed (cracking with a circumferential orientation) can theoretically lead to a postulated
tube rupture event provided that the postulated through-wall circumferential crack exists near the top of the tubesheet.
An evaluation including analysis and testing has been done to determine the resistive strength of the expanded tubes
within the tubesheet. This evaluation provides the basis for the acceptance criteria for tube degradation subject
to the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 length of roll expansion is sufficient to preclude tube pullout from tube degradation located below the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance, regardless of the extent of the tube degradation. The Technical Specification leakage rate requirements
and accident analysis assumptions remain unchanged in the unlikely event that significant leakage from this region
does occur. The tube rupture and pullout is fully bounded by the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included
in the UFSAR. The leakage testing of the roll expanded tubes indicates that for tube expansion lengths approximately
equal to the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance, any postulated primary to secondary leakage from F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tubes would be insignificant. The proposed alternate repair criteria does not adversely impact any other previously
evaluated design basis accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leakage from an F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tube would be limited by the tube-to-tubesheet interface since this leak would occur below the secondary face of the
tubesheet. Qualification testing and previous experience indicate that normal and faulted leakage is well below
Technical Specification and administrative limits creating no increase in the consequences associated with tube
rupture type leakages. The UFSAR analyzed accident scenarios are still bounding since the normal and faulted leak
rates are well within the normal operating limit of 150 gallons per day. This conclusion is consistent with previous
F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 programs approved and used at other operating plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the design and operating characteristics of the steam generator and connected systems are preserved since
the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria utilizes the ``as rolled'' tube configuration that exists as part of the original steam generator design.
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 joint has been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted condition loadings in accordance with Regulatory
Guide 1.121 safety factors. The potential for tube rupture is not increased from the original submittal as demonstrated
in the qualification analyses and testing completed in the BWNT report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide
a mechanism to initiate an accident outside of the region of the expanded portion of the tube. In the unlikely event
the failed tube severed completely at a point below the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 region, the remaining F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 joint would retain engagement in the tubesheet due to its length of expanded contact within the tubesheet bore. This
engagement length would prevent any interaction of the severed tube with neighboring tubes. Any hypothetical accident
as a result of any tube degradation in the expanded region of the tube would be bounded by the existing tube rupture accident
analysis. Tube bundle structural integrity will be maintained. Tube bundle leak tightness will be maintained such
that any postulated accident leakage from F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 tubes will be negligible with regard to offsite doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there is not a potential for creating the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria has been demonstrated to maintain the integrity of the tube bundle commensurate with the requirements of
Reg Guide 1.121 and the primary to secondary pressure boundary under normal and postulated accident conditions.
Acceptable tube degradation for the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria is any degradation indication in the tubesheet region, more than the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance from the secondary face of the tubesheet or the top of the last hardroll contact point which ever is further
into the tubesheet. The safety factors used in the verification of the strength of the degraded tube are consistent
with the safety factors in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and Reg Guide 1.121 used in steam generator design.
The F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 distance has been verified by various testing to be greater than the length of the roll expanded tube-to-tubesheet
interface required to preclude both tube pullout and significant leakage during normal and postulated accident
conditions. The protective boundaries of the steam generator continue to be maintained with the use of the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. A tube with the indication of degration previously requiring removal from service can be kept in service
through the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria. Since the joint is constrained within the tubesheet bore, there is no additional risk associated with the
previously analyzed tube rupture event. The leak testing acceptance criteria are based on the primary to secondary
leakage limit in the Technical Specifications and the leakage assumptions used in the UFSAR accident analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the alternate repair criteria will decrease the number of tubes which must be taken out of service
with tube plugs or repaired by sleeves. Both plugs and sleeves reduce the RCS flow margin; thus, implementation of
the F
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased plugging or sleeving.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in margin with
respect to plant safety as defined in the UFSAR or the Technical Specification Bases.

Safety Feature Actuation System analog channels. These changes are limited to the specific Reactor Protection System
(RPS) channels evaluated in the WCAP (including all supplements) and are subject to the conditions specified by the
NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The surveillance or test frequency may be changed from monthly to quarterly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The time allowed for a channel to be inoperable or out of service in an untripped condition may be changed from 1 hour
to 6 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The time a channel in a functional group may be bypassed to perform testing may be increased from 2 to 4 hours. This
bypass time applies to either an inoperable channel when testing is done in the tripped mode or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to the channel in test when testing is done in the bypass mode. The Allowed Outage Time for maintenance of a channel is
12 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Routine channel testing may be performed in the bypassed condition instead of the tripped condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a number of editorial changes are made to improve clarity, and two-loop operating requirements are proposed
to be deleted. Also, the surveillance test interval for RTS interlocks is proposed to be changed from monthly to once-per-refueling
(about 18 months). Although not part of WCAP-10271, this was previously approved generically by NRC.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination that the results of the proposed changes are within all acceptable criteria was established in
the SER(s) [Safety Evaluation Report(s)] prepared for WCAP-10271, WCAP-10271 Supplement 1, WCAP-10271 Supplement
2 and WCAP-10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1 issued by letters dated February 21, 1985, February 22, 1989 and April 30,
1990. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection
System yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in an
increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the probability
of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in Core Damage Frequency (CDF) due to Engineered
Safety Features Actuation System unavailability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core
melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5
fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of RPS instrumentation. This reduction
is primarily attributable to testing in bypass and less frequent surveillance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in [***] core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability
resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The values determined by the WOG [Westinghouse Owners Group] and presented in the WCAP for the increase in CDF were
verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff. Based
on the small value of the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the CDF, the increase is considered acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to Surveillance Test Frequencies for the Reactor Trip System Interlocks do not represent a significant reduction
in testing. The currently specified test interval for interlock channels allows the surveillance requirement to
be satisfied by verifying that the permissive logic is in its required state using the annunciator status light. The
surveillance, as currently required, only verifies the status of the permissive logic and does not address verification
of channel setpoint or operability. The setpoint verification and channel operability are verified after a refueling
shutdown. The definition of the channel check includes comparison of the channel status with other channels for the
same parameter. The requirement to routinely verify permissive status is a different consideration than the availability
of trip or actuation channels which are required to change state on the occurrence of an event and for which the function
availability is more dependent on the surveillance interval. The change in surveillance requirement to at least
once every 18 months does not therefore represent a significant change in channel surveillance and does not involve
a significant increase in unavailability of the Reactor Protection System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not result in an increase in the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes affects the probability of failure of the RPS but does not alter the manner
in which protection is afforded nor the manner in which limiting criteria are established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not result in a change in the manner in which the Reactor Protection System provides plant protection.
No change is being made which alters the functioning of the Reactor Protection System (other than in a test mode). Rather
the likelihood or probability of the Reactor Protection System functioning properly is affected as described above.
Therefore,the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident nor involve a reduction
in a margin of safety as defined in the Safety Analysis Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve hardware changes except those necessary to implement testing in bypass. Some
existing instrumentation is designed to be tested in bypass and current technical specifications allow testing
in bypass. Testing in bypass is also recognized by IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Standards.
Therefore, testing in bypass has been previously approved and implementation of the proposed change for testing
in bypass does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Furthermore,
since the other proposed changes do not alter the functioning of the RPS, the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints or limiting
conditions for operation are determined. The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a
longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Experience has shown that the initial
uncertainty assumptions are valid for reduced testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Less frequent testing will result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and fewer actuations of Engineered Safety
Feature Actuation System components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Improvements in the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation. This
is due to less frequent distraction of the operator and shift supervisor to attend to instrumentation testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Specifications 3.4.9.3 and 3.4.11 to incorporate power operated relief valve
(PORV) Technical Specification (TS) changes in accordance with the guidance in Generic Letter 90-06 as implemented
in NUREG-1431 Improved Standard Technical Specifications (ISTS), with some exceptions and modifications to reflect
plant specific design features. Certain other TS sections would also be modified to address related TSs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve the details of (a) limiting conditions of operation, and (b) surveillance testing for
equipment needed to protect the reactor vessel from overpressure conditions. This equipment includes PORVs and
their associated block valves, charging pumps, reactor coolant system (RCS) vent, accumulators, and the overpressure
protection system. Numerous administrative changes are also proposed, such as renumbering sections, spelling
out mathematical symbols, changes in nomenclature for consistency, and relocating sentences and paragraphs.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes consolidate the power operated relief valve requirements into Specifications 3.4.9.3 and
3.4.11 which generally adopt the new Improved Standard Technical Specifications of NUREG-1431 to address the concerns
identified in Generic Letter 90-06 except for those changes required to reflect plant specific design features.
These changes are proposed to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves. Since the proposed
changes augment or preserve the requirements contained in the current technical specifications, we have concluded
that these changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to the PORVs or their setpoints. These changes do not delete
any function previously provided by the PORVs nor has the probability of inadvertent opening been increased. Accordingly,
no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
single failure been identified as a result of these changes. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes have been incorporated to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves
to ensure their availability when called upon to perform their function. These changes do not affect the manner by
which the facility is operated or involve a change to equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics
of the facility. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis. The staff notes that a significant effort has been made by the NRC
and by industry over the last several years to improve and tighten the TS requirements for overpressure protection
systems. These efforts are documented in Generic Letter 90-06 and NUREG-1431. The changes proposed by the licensee
appear to result in TSs that are significantly more comprehensive and restrictive than those now existing for Beaver
Valley Units 1 and 2, and, therefore, should help to reduce the probability of an accident. The staff disagrees with
the licensee's claim that the changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated (consideration number
3 above). However, the staff believes that the proposed TS changes require more restrictive operation (such as more
careful control of the number of charging pumps which can inject into the RCS) and do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Based on the NRC staff's review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated since the diesel generator availability and reliability is not being changed. The quantitative acceptance
criteria for new fuel oil is not being changed. Diesel generator performance will therefore not be changed due to the
proposed revision to SR [surveillance requirement] 4.8.1[.1].2.d.1.d. The diesel generator will continue to provide
sufficient electrical power to ESF [engineered safety feature] systems. The ESF systems will continue to function,
as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant system, and containment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design limits are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this changes will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated due
to the continued availability and reliability of the emergency diesel power source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the method of operating the plant. This change will continue to ensure that the addition
of new fuel oil complies with accepted standards regarding fuel oil quality. Since design requirements continue
to be met and the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new failure mode has
been created. As a result, an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report will not be created due to this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is not reduced because the emergency diesel generators will continue to provide sufficient capacity,
capability, redundancy, and reliability to ensure availability of necessary power to ESF systems. The ESF systems
will continue to function, as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant systems, and
containment design limits are not exceeded. The replacement of the clear and bright qualitative examination with
the proposed quantitative test to determine the actual water/sediment and particulates will ensure that new fuel
oil meets the required limits for these properties prior to addition to the storage tank, therefore assuring that
the quality of the stored fuel is unaffected by the addition of new fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will delete from Facility Operating License No. NPF-73 the Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement
to perform infrared aerial photography every other year. The acceptance limit which forms the licensing basis for
this technical specification is related to environmental impact and has no impact on the margin of safety, accident
analysis, or other design basis impacting the margin of safety. No increase in adverse environmental impact has been
identified over that previously identified in the Final Environmental Statement - Operating License Stage, environmental
impact appraisals, or in any decisions of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. The Final Environmental Statement
concluded, based on a model of combined drift from Units 1 and 2, that no adverse impacts to sensitive species of natural
vegetation or to sensitive species of crops were expected. The staff also examined infrared aerial photographs taken
from 1975 through 1983 and found no injury to vegetation from cooling tower drift in the vicinity of Unit 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued terrestrial monitoring was performed for Beaver Valley Unit 2 by infrared aerial photography in 1986,
1988, 1990, and 1992. The results as provided in the Annual Environmental Reports Non-Radiological concluded, ``Based
on interpretation of the infrared photographs and field verification, there is no evidence to suggest that the BVPS
[Beaver Valley Power Station] cooling towers are causing vegetation stress.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the compilation of the infrared aerial photography performed for both BV-1 and BV-2, deletion of this terrestrial
monitoring requirement will have no impact on the environment or the operation of the plant. Therefore, the proposed
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement to perform infrared aerial photography reflects a commitment described
in Final Environmental Statement Section 5.14.1. Therein it is stated that the preoperational monitoring studies
for BV-2 are based primarily on the BV-1 operational monitoring programs. ``Results of these studies have shown that
there were no BV-1 operational impacts on flora, thus, the only terrestrial monitoring planned for BV-2 is continued
infrared aerial photography every other year. The photographs will be compared with preoperational photographs
of the BV-2 area, nd any signs of injury as a result of salt drift and other sources will be checked. The details of this
terrestrial monitoring program will be specified in the Environmental Protection Plan that will be included in Appendix
B of the operating license.'' The subject of this concern is the impact of salt and water drift on area vegetation including
sensitive agricultural crops. From the standpoint of soil salinization (the effects of the accumulation of salts
in the soil), described in the Environmental Report-Operating License Stage Section 5.3.3, no appreciable impact
resulting from operation of the natural draft cooling towers is anticipated. This is based on the average rate of precipitation
of 36.2 inches annually which greatly reduces the potential for accumulation of salt in the soil. The terrestrial
monitoring program has been performed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Plan and has provided additional
verification that operation of both cooling towers has not produced any evidence of vegetation stress. The proposed
change does not introduce any new mode of plant operation or require any physical modification to the plant, therefore,
this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrared aerial photography surveillance does not affect safety systems and/or systems important to safety. Terrestrial
monitoring is not used in any accident analysis and does not provide a basis for evaluating the radiological consequences
of an accident. Deleting the requirement to perform infrared aerial photography will not result in any environmental
impact from operation of the cooling tower and will not affect the operation of the cooling tower. The operating history
of both the BV-1 and the BV-2 cooling towers has demonstrated that there is no evidence of vegetation stress in accordance
with the results obtained from the infrared aerial photography and other associated methods of environmental monitoring.
Therefore, based on the above, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment will revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 for Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) by removing
the option that allows High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) Pump 1C to be used as an alternative to the preferred pump
for subsystem operability. HPSI pump 1C is an installed spare which is not required to be maintained in an operable
status, and this change is being requested to upgrade the ECCS operability requirements consistent with actual plant
operating needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment will remove the option of using High Pressure Safety Injection Pump 1C (HPSI-1C) to
satisfy, in part, the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) operabilityrequirements specified in Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2. HPSI-1C is an installed spare pump that is not required to be operable unless it is being
used in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump. The required functional response of the ECCS or the
required availability of the minimum equipment necessary to accomplish the ECCS safety function will not be changed
by removing the spare pump option from the Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated cooling performance of the St. Lucie Unit 1 ECCS during postulated accidents conforms to the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 50.46 and the ability to achieve this required performance, including considerations of single-failure
criteria, is independent from optional use of HPSI-1C. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
Eliminating the option for the licensee to utilize HPSI-1C in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump
does not involve the addition of new or different types of equipment to the previously analyzed ECCS. Equipment important
to safety will continue to perform their safety functions as previously analyzed and will not be affected by this proposed
amendment. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing the option to employ the installed spare HPSI pump 1C in lieu of the preferred B-train pump to determine ECCS
operability only removes an operational flexibility that has rarely been used by the licensee. St. Lucie Unit 1 accident
analyses do not take credit for an installed spare pump, the minimum complement of safety injection equipment required
for safe operation of the facility and that is required by LCO 3.5.2 is not changed, and the results of plant accident
and transient analyses are not influenced by this proposed amendment. The proposed change does not alter the bases
for any Technical Specification related to the establishment of, or maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that the specifications for operation and surveillance of the
Seismic Monitoring Instrumentation system will be relocated from Appendix A of the facility operating license to
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report for St. Lucie Unit 1 and Unit 2. Changes to the system will be controlled by
10 CFR 50.59 and the safety analysis report is required to be updated pursuant to 10 CFR 50.71(e). Relocation of these
requirements to the UFSAR is consistent with the NRC ``Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements
for Nuclear Power Reactors'' published in the Federal Register (58 FR 39132) dated July 22, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seismic monitoring instrumentation is not an accident initiator nor a part of the success path(s) which function
to mitigate accidents evaluated in the plant safety analyses. The proposed technical specification change does
not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the
consequences of an accident, nor do the changes alter any assumptions or conditions in any of the plant accident analyses.
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to relocate the existing Technical Specification requirements for Seismic Monitoring Instrumentation
to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation defined
in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the
design or operation of plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that operating and surveillance requirements for the Seismic
Monitoring Instrumentation system will be relocated from Appendix A of the facility license to the Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report for St. Lucie Unit 1 and Unit 2. Seismic monitoring instruments are not used to actuate safety-related
equipment, provide interlocks, or otherwise perform plant control functions. The instruments are used to record
the magnitude of a seismic event, should it occur. Conditions evaluated in plant accident and transient analyses
do not involve seismic instruments. The proposed changes do not alter the basis for any technical specification that
is related to the establishment of, or the maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises Technical Specifications Section 3/4.7.1.1, Turbine Cycle, Safety Valves, to delete

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the main steam code safety valves will continue to be tested in accordance with current
NRC requirements as implemented through 10 CFR 50.55a. The NRC specifies the ASME code requirements for a facility
through revisions to 10 CFR 50.55a and through the review and approval of the plant specific in-service testing plan
for pumps and valves at the beginning of each in-service inspection interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability or consequences of an accident are not increased because testing of the main steam safety valves is
in accordance with the appropriate NRC requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of this modified specification can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated since there is no physical change to the facility or the set points for the main steam safety valves.
The valves will be tested in accordance with current requirements. No new failure mode is introduced due to the change
because no plant change is being made and main steam safety valve test methods are consistent with the endorsed edition
of the ASME Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing technical specification references an outdated version of the ASME Code. This change corrects the reference
to Specification 4.0.5 which ensures that in-service testing of ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 pumps and valves will be
performed in accordance with a periodically updated version of Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
and Addenda as required by 10 CFR 50.55a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety valve setpoints or tolerances are not changed by this proposal. Therefore, the modified specification corrects
the ASME Code reference and does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, we have determined that the proposed amendment does not (1) involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the probability of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety; and therefore
does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to Definition 15, ``Primary Containment Integrity'' and Definition 16, ``Secondary Containment
Integrity'' agree with the corresponding definitions of the STS. These changes are administrative in nature in that
they only clarify the requirements for containment integrity and the appropriate means of isolating penetrations.
These changes do not affect the operation or function of the containment isolation systems and, therefore, do not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary Containment Integrity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to TS section 3.7.A, ``Primary Containment Integrity'', only adds a specific requirement to restore
primary containment integrity within 1 hour or commence a plant shutdown. These actions are consistent with the actions
specified in STS for primary containment integrity. No changes to the primary containment boundary or the requirements
for primary containment integrity have been proposed. Therefore, this change does not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to TS section 3.7.B, ``Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves'' are editorial in nature
in that the wording has only been changed to be consistent with the STS requirements for primary containment isolation
valves. These changes do not affect the function of the valves, the requirements to isolate a penetration with an inoperable
containment isolation valve or the actual methods of isolation. Penetrations are still required to be isolated within
4 hours in a manner that cannot be adversely affected by a single active failure. Therefore, these changes do not result
in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drywell Average Air Temperature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of limits, actions, and surveillance requirements for drywell average air temperature are intended
to ensure that the initial assumptions in the DAEC Primary Containment Response Analysis to a DBA remain valid. The
temperature limit (135
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) corresponds to the initial drywell average temperature assumed for this analysis in the UFSAR. The specified
limits, actions and surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. The addition of this limit to the TS will not
affect the actual operation or function of any equipment but will ensure that the containment analysis remains valid.
Therefore, the addition of this limit will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressure Suppression Chamber-Reactor Building Vacuum Breakers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.D only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the pressure suppression
chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS.
Specifying separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed),
or open better reflects the dual functions of these valves (vacuum relief and containment isolation). The additional
surveillance requirement will better ensure that the containment isolation function of these valves is maintained.
The rewording of existing surveillances only clarifies current requirements. These changes do not affect the actual
function, setpoints, or number of valves required to be operable and therefore do not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drywell-Pressure Suppression Chamber Vacuum Breakers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.E, only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the drywell-pressure
suppression chamber vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS. Specifying
separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed) or open better
reflects the dual functions of these valves. The additional requirement to verify that each vacuum breaker is closed
at least once per week will better ensure that the isolation boundary between the drywell and torus is maintained.
The elimination of the requirement to exercise all operable drywell-pressure suppression chamber vacuum breakers
upon determination that a vacuum breaker is inoperable for opening will not affect the reliability of these vacuum
breakers. The only valid reason to exercise the operable vacuum breakers is if a common mode failure is suspected.
We have reviewed the maintenance history of these valves and have not identified any instance of common mode failures.
Conditional testing of these changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Main Steam Isolation Valve Leakage Control System (MSIV-LCS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to TS Section 3/4.7.F, ``MSIV-LCS'', deletes the unnecessary and potentially non-conservative conditional
surveillance testing of the redundant MSIV-LCS subsystems. Although the proposed change will reduce the amount
of testing of the MSIV-LCS, reliability of these systems would not be decreased and the necessary assurance that the
alternate systems/subsystems/components will operate when needed is provided by the ASME Section XI IST Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of human error will decrease with reduced testing. Human error such as a misalignment of valves after
the system is returned to its normal configuration following testing and the misdirection of the operators attention
from monitoring and directing plant operations is less likely to occur if this testing is eliminated. Additionally,
reducing the scope and frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the probability of equipment failure (due
to testing) which could require plant shutdown. Therefore, this change will not increase the probability of occurrence
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suppression Pool Level and Temperature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.F, ``Suppression Pool Level and Temperature'', are intended to clarify these requirements
and make them more consistent with STS. The revision to the applicability statement which deletes the requirement
for suppression pool level and temperature to be within the specified limits during work which has the potential to
drain the vessel is in accordance with STS. Suppression pool level and temperature limits ensure that the suppression
pool has the capability of acting as a heat sink for design basis events but are not appropriate or applicable during
the refueling or cold shutdown conditions. No changes have been made to the actual suppression pool temperature or
level limits and therefore, the assumptions made in the accident and transient analyses remain valid. These limits
are consistent with the STS. The revisions to the surveillance requirements are also intended to improve clarity
and consistency with STS. The deletion of the requirement to monitor suppression pool water temperature every 5 minutes
during relief valve operation is appropriate in that plant operating and emergency operating procedures already
specify what actions are to be taken when suppression pool average water temperature increases above 95
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F including initiation of suppression pool cooling. Monitoring pool temperature every 5 minutes during these
events is not necessary and is redundant to other actions. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase
the probability of occurrence of the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the applicability of TS section 3.7.H, ``Containment Atmosphere Dilution'', requiring the containment
atmosphere dilution system to be operable only when the reactor is in power operation and the primary containment
is required to be inerted will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the CAD system can only function when the containment is inerted. The function of the CAD system
is to inject nitrogen into the containment after a LOCA and ensure the containment remains inerted. Drywell inspections
performed after plant startup and prior to plant shutdown require that the primary containment be de-inerted for
personnel access. Therefore, CAD system operability is not required during these inspections. No changes to the
actual function or purpose of the CAD system are proposed.

Oxygen Concentration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.1, ``Oxygen Concentration'' are administrative in that they only clarify the requirement
that both the suppression chamber and the drywell must have oxygen concentrations less than 4 [percent] by volume.
The revisions to the surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. Decreasing the frequency of verification
of oxygen concentration from twice per week to once per week is in accordance with STS and reflects the fact that during
power operation, the containment is inerted and slightly pressurized such that air (oxygen) cannot leak into the
containment. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary Containment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion of the requirement to operate the SGTS immediately after a secondary containment violation is identified
will not affect the reliability of the secondary containment in that containment integrity is normally fully restored
immediately after a violation is identified. The testing of the SGTS involves insertion of a Group III containment
isolation signal and is only appropriate if the restoration of secondary containment involves a temporary or new
secondary containment boundary. These modifications to a secondary containment boundary, however, would require
that the SGTS be operated as part of post modification testing. Deleting the requirement for the SGTS to be operated
after minor secondary containment violations will reduce the possibility of human error (such as misalignment of
valves after the system is returned to its normal configuration) due to reduced testing. Operation of the SGTS after
a secondary containment violation is not required by STS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision of the definition of calm wind conditions will not affect the reliability or availability of the secondary
containment or SGTS. An engineering evaluation on the effects of wind speed and direction on the ability of the SGTS
to maintain 1/4'' vacuum in secondary containment has been performed. The results indicate that while wind effects
can be seen on individual instruments, there is minimal effect on the average instrument readings with wind speeds
up to 15 mph. A discussion of this evaluation has been added to the Bases of TS section 3.7. Therefore, these changes
will not significantly increase the probability or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondary Containment Automatic Isolation Dampers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of operability requirements, actions and surveillance requirements for secondary containment isolation
dampers better ensures the integrity and isolation capability of the secondary containment. The new specifications
are consistent with the requirements of the STS. The actual function or operation of the secondary containment isolation
valves/dampers will not be affected. The appropriate valves/dampers will be incorporated in plant procedures that
are subject to the change control provisions of TS. Therefore, these changes will not increase the probability of
occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the TS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standby Gas Treatment System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change to the output requirements of the inlet heaters for each train of the SGTS from 11 kw to 22 kw better ensures
that these heaters (and the SGTS) can perform their design function. The 22 kw output requirement ensures that the
inlet air humidity does not exceed the 70 [percent] humidity specified in the UFSAR. This change does not affect the
actual operation of the heaters or the SGTS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to demonstrate the HEPA filter uniform air distribution after HEPA filter replacement or after structural
maintenance on the filter system housing (rather than annually) will not decrease the reliability of the SGTS. The
air flow test will be performed after work or modifications which have the ability to disrupt the system geometry or
result in potential flow blockage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the shutdown LCO requirement in the various specifications from requiring the plant to be in Cold Shutdown
in 24 hours to requiring Hot Shutdown in 12 hours and Cold Shutdown (or other condition not requiring equipment operability)
in the following 24 hours is consistent with STS and the shutdown requirements in TS section 3.5. This new requirement
will allow the reactor to be shutdown in a more controlled manner and will not result in a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the Bases are administrative in that they only reflect the changes to the individual specifications
described previously in this section or correct minor discrepancies. All changes are consistent with the applicable
specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed amendment will not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the above response to question #1, none of the proposed changes alters the design of the plant or equipment
or the plant's transient response. The changes to the definitions and limiting conditions for operation applicable
to TS section 3.7 are consistent with STS and better ensure that equipment assumed to be operable in our accident analysis
will be operable upon demand. The addition of limiting conditions for operation for drywell average temperature
and secondary containment isolation valves will better ensure that the assumptions in our accident analysis remain
valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the surveillance requirements are consistent with the STS. Those systems required to mitigate accidents
evaluated in the UFSAR will still be operable and available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reduction in conditional surveillance testing of certain systems and equipment will reduce the probability
of equipment failure as a result of excessive testing or due to human error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the limiting conditions for operation in Chapter 3.7 of the TS will not invalidate the original licensing
basis assumptions and will not invalidate any assumptions or input parameters for any DAEC event analysis. These
changes provide more specific guidance only and are in accordance with the STS. Extending the time period within which
the DAEC must achieve Cold Shutdown conditions will permit increased operator attention and minimal distractions
for operators during shutdown, thus minimizing the risks of unexpected operational transients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional surveillance testing for certain instrumentation and systems will provide additional assurance that
these systems will be available when needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elimination of unnecessary or conditional surveillance testing will not reduce the minimum necessary equipment
operability requirements or equipment reliability. Elimination of the redundant testing will reduce equipment
failure due to excessive testing or human error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed administrative changes do not change the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and do not involve a reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed license amendment is judged to involve no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change affects only an administrative control, which was based on the existing industry guidance in
ANSI N18.1-1971, that recommended the Operations Manager hold a SRO license. The current guidance in Section 4.2.2
of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987 recommends, as one option, that the Operations Manager have held a license for a similar unit
and the Operations Middle Manager hold a SRO license. The Operations Middle Manager position does not exist at NNECO
[Northeast Nuclear Energy Company]. Therefore, the proposed change requests an exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 to
allow use of ANSI/ANS-3.101987 in a limited circumstance. Specifically, the proposed revision to Technical Specification
6.3.1 would temporarily allow the Operations Manager to have held a SRO at a PWR [pressurized water reactor] other
than Millstone Unit No. 3. The proposed revision would be in effect for the period ending three years after the Staff's
approval for this request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 will allow at least one of the Operations Assistants (instead of a Operations
Middle Manager) to hold, and continue to hold, a SRO license, if the Operations Manager does not hold a license. The
proposed change includes the requirement if the Operations Manager does not hold a SRO license at Millstone Unit No.
3, he shall have held a license for a similar unit in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987. For those
areas of knowledge that require a SRO license, at least one of the Operations Assistants hold a SRO license and provides
technical guidance normally required by the Operations Manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not alter the design of any system, structure, or component. It does not change the way any
plant systems are operated. It does not reduce the knowledge, qualifications, or skills of any operator on watch,
and does not affect the way the Operations Department is managed by the Operations Manager in maintaining the effective
performance of his personnel and to ensure the plant is operated safely and in accordance with the requirements of
the Operating License. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not detract from the Operations Manager's ability to perform his primary responsibilities.
In this case, by having previously held a SRO license for a similar unit, he will have gained the necessary training,
skills, and experience to fully understand the operation of plant equipment and the watch requirements for operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not weaken the supervisory chain that presently exists in the Operations Department. All
Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by the licensed Shift Supervisor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed change does not affect the ability of the Operations Manager to provide the plant oversight
required of his position. In addition, it does not have any [e]ffect on the probability or consequences of any previously
evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Technical Specification 6.3.1 does not affect the design or function of any plant system, structure,
or component. It does not affect, in any way, the performance of NRC licensed operators, nor does it change the way any
plant equipment is operated. Operation of the plant in conformance with technical specifications and other license
requirements will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold an NRC SRO license. The proposed change to Technical
Specification 6.3.1 ensures that the Operations Manager will be a knowledgeable and qualified individual. The proposed
change does not introduce any new failure modes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves only an administrative control which is not related to the margin of safety as defined
in the technical specifications. The proposed change does not reduce the level of knowledge or experience required
of an individual who fills the Operations Manager position, nor does it affect the conservative manner in which the
plant is operated. All Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold a SRO license.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not affect the the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The safety analysis performed for this change concludes that the ground water level is stable, predictable, and significantly
below the acceptance criteria established in the Technical Specifications. Thus, less frequent monitoring of the
ground water level does not increase the probability that the Spray Pond will become inoperable due to rising ground
water levels or the probability of any accident scenarios associated with Spray Pond inoperability. The Technical
Specification change will not impact the function or the method of operation of plant systems, structures, or components.
Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR are not
increased by the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change dies not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation
of the SSCs; and therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance frequency to biannual does not reduce
the margin of safety. The ground water level in the vicinity of the Spray Pond has been proven to be stable and predictable
through twelve years of monthly data collection. This data has shown the highest ground water levels (still considerably
lower than the Technical Specification limit) to occur in the months of April and October. Therefore, surveillance
of the ground water level at the observation sites during April and October will adequately monitor this aspect of
the Spray Pond operability.

3. [These changes do not involve] a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Specification operability requirements for the radiation monitors are not being changed. Relocating
the Salem specific radiation monitor numbers to the Bases will not change any requirements for the radiation monitors.
The change to the note on Table 3.3-6 is editorial to provide a more accurate description of the required radiation

1. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect any accident initiators and therefore the probability of any accident is not increased.
Consequences of the changes are analyzed and shown acceptable in the [Westinghouse LOFTTR2 Analysis of Potential
Radiological Consequences Following a Steam Generator Tube Rupture at the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant] analysis,
WCAP-11668, Section III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve no physical modifications to the plant; therefore, no new accident can be postulated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety, as no margin of safety is reduced by the proposed changes, as shown in WCAP-11668.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information, it has been determined that the proposed changes to the Ginna Station Technical
Specifications do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated, and does not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes meet the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.92(c) and do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would merge Toledo Edison Company into Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. As described
in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. Therefore, the licensee uses the
nomenclature ``NEWCO'' as a temporary name of the combined operating company, and will provide the permanent name
by supplemental letter. The amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company with ``NEWCO'' as a licensee, (2) designate ``NEWCO'' as the owner of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station,
Unit 1, and (3) make other associated changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior
Service Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.

The proposed amendment would remove Core Spray (CS) High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Vermont Yankee

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation is consistent with NRC requirements concerning this instrumentation. This
instrumentation is considered NNS [nonnuclear safety] and performs a local monitoring and alarm function only.
In addition, the NRC has recently approved the removal of Core Spray Sparger Break Detection Instrumentation from
the Technical Specifications of another BWR [boiling water reactor] with a similar situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. CS Sparger Piping integrity is still assured. The instrumentation
systems to be removed from the ECCS Actuation Instrumentation Technical Specifications do not perform any automatic
control or trip function. In addition, this instrumentation does not provide information that is required to permit
the control room operator to take manual actions that are required for safety systems to accomplish their safety functions
for design basis accident events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not result in any system hardware modification, function change or new plant configuration.
The requested change to ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not impact any FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] safety
analysis involving the ECCS or Protection Systems. These monitoring functions are not contributors to the initiation
of accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative changes to correct typographical errors on Tables 3.2.1 and 4.2.1 will have no affect on plant
hardware, plant design, safety limit setting or plant system operation and therefore, do not modify or add any initiating
parameters that would significantly increase the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is concluded that there is not a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The function of the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation to be removed from the Technical Specifications
is for local indication and alarm only. These functions are not necessary for operators to accomplish any safety functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any change in hardware, function, Technical Specification trip setpoints,
plant operation, redundancy, protective function or design basis of the plant. There is no impact on any existing
safety analysis or safety design limits. Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation functions do not initiate
nuclear system parameter variations which are considered potential initiating causes of threats to the fuel and
the nuclear system process barrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed administrative change only corrects typographical errors concerning equipment
identification numbers. This change doe not affect any equipment and it does not involve any potential initiating
events that would create any new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not affect any existing safety margins. This equipment is NNS and performs
a local indication and alarming function only. The original intent of this detection system was because the first
BWR plants had only the CS System for long-term core cooling. Later, plants like VY [Vermont Yankee] were provided
with Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Systems in addition to CS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Technical Specification requirements for automatic trip functions are unaffected. Failure of the Core
Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not preclude the ability of the CS System to perform its safety function
to mitigate the consequences of accidents or of any other safety system to accomplish its safety functions. Proper
ECCS functioning post-accident is not relied upon by NNS alarming functions but by such systems as safety related
reactor level indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. The removal from the Technical Specifications has no affect
on the bases of Protective Instrumentation which is to operate to initiate required system protective actions. The
Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not perform any safety function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the proposed administrative change which corrects typographical errors does not affect any
equipment involved in potential initiating events or safety limits. [***].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 6, 1993, the licensee submitted a significant modification to its original request of March 18, 1992 (April
19, 1992 (57 FR 12349)). The modified request would amend the Technical Specifications (TS) to provide two surveillance
tests to determine the operability of the catalyst beds in the containment atmospheric control (CAC) system. One
test compares hydrogen content in the influent to the hydrogen content in effluent process streams to assure the catalyst
is operating. The second test measures the temperature profile in the catalyst bed to ensure that sufficient catalyst
remains available for the recombination process during postulated accident conditions. Since the original proposal
has been significantly changed, the staff is issuing a new notice and proposed no significant hazards consideration
determination.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is
presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of the hydrogen recombiners, which are
accident mitigation systems. The proposed change revises surveillance requirements to ensure that existing equipment
will perform as designed in response to postulated events. The proposed change does not, therefore, involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of existing equipment, and does not, therefore,
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change increases surveillance requirements for existing equipment to ensure that the equipment will
perform as designed. With equipment performing as designed in response to postulated accidents, the proposed change
does not affect any existing margins of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the licensee's analysis and the staff's analysis, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

be revised to explicitly link operability of the associated Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip
channel to operability of the associated auxiliary feedwater pump. In addition, minor format inconsistencies in
TS 3.4.b.1.A and 3.4.b.1.B would be corrected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated, or

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent of interpretation of the TS. Therefore,
no significant hazards exist.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment request proposes to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to implement the NRC's Final Policy Statement
on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors (58 FR 39132). These improvements involve focusing
the Technical Specifications on those requirements that are of controlling importance to operational safety by
screening each TS in Section 3/4.1 through 3/4.11 using the criteria provided in the policy statement. The purpose
of the proposed amendment request is to relocate the specifications that do not meet any of the four policy statement
criteria. The relocated specifications will be moved to Updated Final Safety Analysis (USAR) Chapter 16. Based on
the screening, all or part of 38 technical specifications were identified as not meeting any of the criteria and, therefore,
as candidates for relocation. The licensee has categorized the TS changes as (1) specifications relocated intact
to USAR Chapter 16, (2) specifications relocated with portions retained in TS, (3) specifications relocated with
programmatic requirements referenced in Section 6 of TS, (4) modifications to retained specifications to accomodate
relocation of other specifications, and (5) new specification requirements incorporated into the TS. The last category
is used to effect the retention of portions of relocated specifications and accomodate the policy statement recommendation
to incorporate industry experience in the determination of TS content.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes involve relocating requirements that are not conditions or limitations
on reactor operation necessary to obviate the possibility of an abnormal situation or event giving rise to an immediate
threat to the public health and safety. The proposed changes were identified through the application of criteria
designed to cull those requirements that are not important to operational safety from the Technical Specifications.
In this process, selected provisions of the Technical Specifications identified for relocation were retained if
necessary to support a Technical Specification that was to be retained. Thus, only specification requirements that
have little or no operational safety significance are proposed for relocation. In addition, those requirements
that would be relocated will be included in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and, therefore, will be
controlled and implemented as NRC commitments. In this manner, those requirements that have no operational safety
significance but involve maintaining the plant in its as-designed state (for example, through surveillance programs)
would be controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the criteria for identifying requirements to be retained in the Technical Specifications specifically
call out, for retention, those structures, systems, or components that are required to mitigate accidents previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to another licensee-controlled
document. No changes or physical alterations of the plant are involved. Also, no changes to the operation of the plant
or equipment are involved. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do the proposed changes involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to the USAR. The requirements to
be relocated were identified by applying the criteria endorsed in the Commission's Policy Statement. Thus, those
specifications that would be relocated do not impose constraints on design and operation of the plant that are derived
form the plant safety analysis report or from probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) information and do not belong
in the Technical Specifications in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36 and the purpose of the Technical Specifications stated
in the Policy Statement. Therefore, relocation of these requirements does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, revisions to the USAR will be evaluated in accordance with the 10 CFR 50.59 process which considers the
reduction in safety margin. Therefore, any future revisions to the provisions in the USAR will consider reductions
in the margin of safety using the criteria for identifying an unreviewed safety question.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Operation at 3565 MWt does not
affect any of the mechanisms postulated in the USAR to cause LOCA or non-LOCA design basis events. Analyses, evaluations
and minimum DNBR [departure from nucleate boiling ratio] calculations confirm that the USAR conclusions remain
valid for the proposed changes. On these bases it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents
previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possiblity of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created. The proposed change provides revised operating limits
necessary to support Cycle 8, and does not change the method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases
in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The analyses and evaluations discussed in the safety
evaluation demonstrate that all applicable safety analysis acceptance criteria continue to be met for the proposed
operating conditions. Items not specifically cited in this safety evaluation have been reviewed and have been found
to be bounded by the evaluations performed for Reference 1 [Wolf Creek Generating Station Technical Specifications].
Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical specification, is
not reduced.

The amendments modify the TS for the overpressure protection systems. The allowable outage time (AOT) for one inoperable
residual heat removal (RHR) relief valve with one or more of the reactor coolant system cold leg temperatures less
than or equal to 310 degrees Fahrenheit is being decreased from 7 days to 24 hours for water-solid conditions. The required
AOT for low temperature conditions, other than water-solid, will remain at 7 days with one RHR relief valve inoperable,
provided the pressurizer level is less than or equal to 30 percent and a dedicated operator is assigned to monitor and
control the reactor coolant system pressure.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment modifies the technical specifications (TS) to address new containment purge and vent valves to be installed
in the 1994 refueling outage. The amendment changes the containment purge and vent valve TS as follows: (1) removes
the requirement ensuring that valve position remains at less than or equal to 70 degrees, (2) changes the containment
leak testing requirements for the metal-to-metal seated valves from 6 months to 2 years since they have improved seat
designs, and (3) makes administrative changes to delete an out-of-date note, to relocate an action statement requirement
from the TS surveillance section to the TS action statement section, and to change a related TS reference to this surveillance
section. Valve opening position does not need to be limited to less than or equal to 70 degrees. The resiliently-seated
valves have a permanently installed mechanical stop to limit the open position to ensure adequate closure times.
The metal-to-metal seated valves are designed to close from the 90-degree open position.

Stephen Mignotte (Mr. Mignotte) held Senior Reactor Operator License No. SOP&hyph;11160 (License) issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55. The license authorized Mr. Mignotte
to manipulate, and to supervise the manipulation of, the controls of the nuclear power reactor at the New York Power
Authority's (Facility Licensee) Indian Point 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Buchanan, New York. On November 23, 1993, Mr.
Mignotte resigned his employment with the New York Power Authority, which caused the License to expire. Additionally,
the Facility Licensee, in a letter dated December 23, 1993, informed the NRC that the New York Power Authority no longer
had a need to maintain Mr. Mignotte's operating license for the Indian Point Unit 3 Nuclear Power Plant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The responsibilities associated with a Senior Reactor Operator license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55 require
that individuals be fit for duty while performing safety-related activities at the facility. The character of the
individual, which includes the individual's trustworthiness, is a consideration in issuing an operator license.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182a of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2232a). In determining whether or not an individual
seeking a license to be a reactor operator or senior reactor operator has the necessary character and trustworthiness,
the Commission takes into account any history of illegal drug use by the applicant. Prior to May 26, 1987, each applicant
for a reactor operator or senior reactor operator license was required to certify that the applicant had no drug or
narcotic habit on the Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. Since that time, the NRC has required an evaluation
of the applicant prepared by a physician as part of a license application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR 55.23(a). This evaluation is presented on a Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR 55.23. Among the factors to be considered by the certifying physician are factors such as use of illegal drugs
or abuse of alcohol.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 10 CFR Part 26, the Facility Licensee established a program to provide reasonable assurance that
nuclear power plant personnel are not under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal, which affects their
ability to safely and competently perform their duties, including measures for early detection of persons who are
not fit to perform licensed activities. In addition, licensed operators are required by 10 CFR 55.53(j) to refrain
from use of illegal drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. Licensed operators are also required by 10 CFR 55.53(k)
to participate in 10 CFR Part 26 fitness-for-duty programs established by the Facility Licensees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte, while on duty as a Senior Reactor Operator at the Indian Point 3 facility, was requested
by the Facility Licensee to provide a urine sample to the nurse at the plant after being randomly selected as part of
the routine fitness for duty chemical testing program required of the Facility Licensee by the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR
26.24. After receiving a sample from Mr. Mignotte, the nurse checked the temperature of the sample, noticed that it
felt ``cool to the touch'', and found that the temperature was below specifications in 10 CFR Part 26, Appendix A, &sect;2.4(g)(14),
for acceptable urine samples. As a result, Mr. Mignotte was requested to provide a witnessed urine sample to the Facility
Licensee in accordance with the same section of the Appendix. Mr. Mignotte provided a second sample which was subsequently
determined, on November 30, 1993, to contain both marijuana and cocaine above cutoff levels specified by the Appendix.
After the witnessed urine sample had been collected on November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte was suspended from licensed
duties and he subsequently resigned that same day. These facts were provided to the NRC by the Facility Licensee, in
letters dated December 23, 1993 and January 3, 1994, and were discussed in the report of an NRC inspection conducted
January 12&hyph;13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the second, witnessed urine sample indicate that Mr. Mignotte used illegal drugs, which is a violation
of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j). Furthermore, his performance of licensed duties while
under the influence of illegal drugs is also a violation of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j).
Based on the temperature of the first urine sample provided by Mr. Mignotte and the fact that the first sample yielded
negative results when tested for illegal substances while the subsequent, witnessed sample yielded positive results,
I conclude that the first sample was a surrogate false sample, submitted by Mr. Mignotte in an attempt to conceal illegal
drug use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) prohibits any employee of a licensee from deliberately submitting to the NRC, a licensee, or a licensee's
contractor or subcontractor, information that the person submitting the information knows to be incomplete or inaccurate
in some respect material to the NRC. The urine samples collected within the context of a licensee's chemical testing
program pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 26 represent information material to an access authorization
and fitness-for-duty decision. Therefore, Mr. Mignotte's deliberately submitting inaccurate information material
to the NRC in the form of a false sample is a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2). In addition, Mr. Mignotte violated 10 CFR
50.5(a)(1) by deliberately providing to the Facility Licensee a surrogate urine sample that he knew to be inaccurate
at the time he submitted it and which, but for detection, would have caused the Facility Licensee to be in violation
of 10 CFR 50.9(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Nignotte's failure to comply with the prohibition against illegal drug use and his attempts to circumvent the
chemical testing program to avoid detection of illegal drug use while employed by the Facility Licensee are violations
of the conditions of Mr. Mignotte's license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53 (j) and (k), and demonstrate an intentional disregard
for the important obligations of a licensed operator.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above, Mr. Mignotte, an employee of the New York Power Authority at the time of the incident, engaged in
deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(1) and (2) by deliberately violating 10 CFR 55.53(k), in that
he submitted to the facility licensee information which he knew to be inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC.
Mr. Mignotte, a licensed Senior Reactor Operator at the time of the event, also used illegal substances and performed
licensed duties while under the influence of illegal substances in violation of 10 CFR 55.53(j), and deliberately
failed to participate in the fitness-for-duty program established by the facility licensee in violation of 10 CFR
55.53(k).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC must be able to rely on its licensees and their employees, especially NRC-licensed operators, to comply with
NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information and maintain records that are complete and accurate
in all material respects. Mr. Mignotte's actions in using illegal drugs and attempting to circumvent fitness-for-duty
requirements have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements applicable
to licensed individuals and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that Mr. Mignotte will conduct any 10 CFR Part 55 licensed
activities in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected
with Mr. Mignotte engaged in such licensed activities at this time. Therefore, I find that the public health, safety,
and interest require that Mr. Mignotte be prohibited from involvement in 10 CFR Part 55 licensed activities for three
years from the date of this Order. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the misconduct
described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.

In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Mignotte must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this
Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically
admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Mr.
Mignotte or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued.
Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN:
Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement
at the same address; to the Regional Administrator, Region I, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 475 Allendale
Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406; and to Mr. Mignotte, if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Mignotte.
If a person other than Mr. Mignotte requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in
which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested by Mr. Mignotee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Mignotee or any person adversely affected, by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time that answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from
the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.

Notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1994, Thomas J. Saporito, Jr. filed a petition under 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's
regulations requesting that the NRC take action against Florida Power and Light Co. as operator of the Turkey Point
and St. Lucie nuclear power stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioner asks that the NRC institute a show cause proceeding to modify, suspend or revoke Florida Power and Light
Co.'s operating licenses and that the NRC take escalated enforcement action for retaliatory actions which were taken
against him, a former employee, for engaging in protected activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.7. Petitioner asks that
the NRC also take escalated enforcement action against every employee of the company who is found to have been involved
in the retaliatory actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to determine which Licensee employees were involved in the relatiatory actions and to assess the overall
work environment at the plants, Petitioner asks that the NRC conduct an investigation. In addition to the specific
acts of retaliation he claims were taken against him, the Petitioner alleges that other employees have also been retaliated
against, creating a chilling effect at the Turkey Point plant beginning in 1988. Petitioner asks that the NRC initiate
an investigation into his claims, which involve alleged violations of 10 CFR 50.7 and 19.15 and the Energy Reorganization
Act, notwithstanding the fact that they are being pursued within the Department of Labor, because of the asserted
public health and safety implications involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioner's request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206,
appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Co. Notice of Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM&hyph;2501</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2501
held by Virginia Electric and Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Surry ISFSI, located in
Surry County, Virginia. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment revises the Technical Specifications making procedural changes to spent fuel characteristics for
the CASTOR V/21 cask and allows use of the CASTOR X/33 cask at the site. These changes do not affect fuel receipt, handling,
and storage safety. They are procedural in nature and result in a change in process operations and equipment that does
not alter the scope and type of operations presently authorized. The safety evaluation for this amendment demonstrates
that the accident consequences for the analyzed design basis accidents remain negligible. There is reasonable assurance
that the public health and safety will remain protected by activities authorized under this amendment and that the
environmental impact will remain insignificant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applications for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as
required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license
amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant
hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental
impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance
of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applications for amendment dated December 23, 1988, May
3, 1991, and November 19, 1993, and (2) Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM&hyph;2501, and (3) the Commission's
letter to the licensee dated June 29, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the report of the National Performance Review (NPR) recommendation to convert the FAR from rigid rules
to guiding principles, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy has established a Board of Directors (hereinafter
the Board), comprised of senior level individuals from the Executive Branch, to develop a plan for the FAR rewrite.
This notice solicits public comment on two approaches for the rewrite, including drafting principles, the Board
is considering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both approaches delineate mandatory and nonmandatory provisions. The first approach would provide for (1) a FAR
that is limited to mandatory governmentwide regulations, and (2) an acquisition manual that would reprint the FAR
and also include nonmandatory governmentwide policies, procedures, etc. In addition, agency supplements, including
both mandatory and nonmandatory provisions, would be authorized to implement agency-unique statutes, policies,
etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second approach would consist of (1) the FAR which would include all mandatory Governmentwide provisions, and
(2) separate acquisition manuals developed by an agency or a group of agencies. The manuals would include mandatory
provisions necessary to implement statutes unique to the agency or group of agencies, a minimal number of mandatory
policies and procedures not required by statute, and nonmandatory guidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both approaches would result in a FAR containing only mandatory provisions. However, the first approach would promulgate
governmentwide nonregulation guidance, while the second approach would permit an agency to promulgate in agency
manuals whatever nonregulation guidance the agency deems appropriate. Additionally, the first approach would
retain agency FAR supplements, while the second approach would replace agency supplements with agency acquisition
manuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has prepared a model rewrite of FAR Part 9 to illustrate the first approach. It is drafted as a governmentwide
manual containing both the new FAR (which will also be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations); and policies,
procedures, provisions, forms, and clauses that do not constitute regulations. An actual FAR rewrite would likely
include a wider variety of options and illustrations than appear in the nonregulation component of the model. This
notice solicits comments only on the proposed approach for the FAR rewrite, and not on the content of the model rewrite
of Part 9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board intends to provide for a mutual exchange of ideas and information with affected parties both in the government
and the private sector by publishing this notice, soliciting public comments, and holding a public meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the NPR which required simplification of the procurement
process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid rules to guiding principles. According to the report, the FAR, which
is the government's principal set of procurement regulations, is too process oriented, changes too often, minimizes
discretion of procurement officials, and stifles innovation. The Board intends to develop a plan to rewrite the FAR
to move from a system of rigid rules to guiding principles, promote decision making at the lowest possible level, eliminate
unnecessary regulatory requirements, facilitate innovative contracting and develop a more effective process
to listen to its customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This project will be accomplished under the direction of the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy with the
assistance of a Board of Directors comprised of senior-level officials from the Executive Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has begun planning the FAR rewrite project by defining two approaches and by drafting a model FAR Part 9 that
adheres, for the most part, to the drafting principles outlined in this announcement as the first approach. However,
if the FAR is actually rewritten along the lines of the model, we expect that there would be additional material and
more than one optional approach or illustration to be included in many parts of the nonregulation part of the model.
The Board intends to recommend adoption of the NPR philosophy of giving greater flexibility in the formulation and
administration of contracts.

Questions for Commentors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist the Board in its deliberations, it is requested that all interested parties review the proposed approaches,
drafting principles, and illustration of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. This notice solicits comments on the proposed
approaches for the FAR rewrite and not on the content of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. In preparing comments the Board
requests that commentors consider the following questions with regard to each approach:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does the proposed approach represent an improvement to the existing FAR system? If not, please suggest an alternative
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the proposed approach remove from the regulations system unnecessary, burdensome direction while still
providing the procurement community with sufficient common policy and principles? If not, please suggest an alternative
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the proposed approach increase discretion and encourage innovation while still fostering good contracting
practices? If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Does the proposed approach simplify the procurement process? If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Does the approach of publishing nonregulation information in an acquisition manual provide useful guidance for
contracting officers in decision making, formulating process or practical solutions, identifying alternatives?
If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Does the proposed approach for the Code of Federal Regulations to contain only the regulation component of the model
raise any concerns for you? If so, please suggest an alternative approach.

. Does this approach create a problem? What problem? If so, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Which types or categories of provisions and clauses would you recommend to be included in the regulation component
of the model? In the nonregulation manual component of the model?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Does the proposed approach to include only guidance needed by procurement personnel improve the contracting process?
If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Is there a better approach for rewriting the FAR? What is it?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic thrust of this approach under consideration by the Board is to divide the FAR into regulation and nonregulation
(a Governmentwide manual) components. The new FAR will essentially retain its current 53 Part structure and will
contain policies, provisions and clauses necessary to implement statutory requirements, primary regulation requirements,
basic policies/guiding principles and essential governmentwide procedures. Much of the material, provisions
and clauses that will be removed from the FAR will be made available in nonregulation remarks in a Federal acquisition
manual. In addition, agencies will continue to issue supplements to the FAR, including minimal mandatory as well
as nonmandatory provisions. The FAR will be mandatory for use by the agencies, and will be codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government acquisition manual will include the FAR text, and in addition, will provide nonmandatory guidance,
alternative approaches, forms, clauses, and other examples that may be used, at their discretion, by contracting
officers in structuring a procurement. The nonregulation material in the manual will be published for public comment
only when required by Section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), which does not require
publication of the type of information normally provided nonregulation component of the acquisition manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR system will promote decision making at the lowest practicable level by permitting contracting officers to
use, modify, tailor to best suit individual situations or disregard nonregulation policies, procedures, provisions,
forms and clauses. For example, in the illustration of a new FAR Part 9, the clauses covering First Article Approval,
Contractor Testing, (FAR 52.209&hyph;3) would be eliminated from the regulation component but would be included
in the nonregulation component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Drafting Principles_Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Include in the FAR statements of general policy, standards, forms, provisions, and clauses that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Are required by, or reasonably necessary to implement Statutes, Executive Orders, OMB Circulars, OFPP Policy
Letters, and, as appropriate, case law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The FAR Council or joint FAR signatories decide must have governmentwide application because consistency is essential
to maintain an effective and efficient acquisition system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Do not include in the FAR:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Procedures, policies, provisions or clauses which are not essential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Guidance that is not needed by procurement personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Include in the acquisition manual_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Examples of various optional methods for compliance with FAR policies, provisions, and clauses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Procedures, practices, forms provisions, and clauses that may be used, modified, or not used, at the discretion
of the Contracting Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Drafting Principles_General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Clearly identify the statutory requirements, basic policies, and principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Avoid proscription and rigid rules in favor of setting forth guiding principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Use goals and expected outcomes in place of processes or procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Assume the reader is a procurement professional with appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities to do the job.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Assume contractors and contracting officials are going to do the ``right thing.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Assign responsibility for decisions to the lowest practicable level, giving contracting officers authority,
responsibility, and maximum flexibility to find the most efficient, cost-effective way to meet customer mission
needs and time frames.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Minimize administrative and paperwork burdens on contracting officials and contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Include in the FAR references to procurement related statutes and regulations, such as labor laws, and small business
size standards. Provide, as appropriate, in the acquisition manual, necessary additional information to assist
the contracting officers in complying with those requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Provide guidance that encourages sound business practices, streamline the contracting process, contributes
to increased productivity, and cost effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Provide guidance that implements policies based on statute without just restating the law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Avoid guidance and other controls that impose unnecessary dollar thresholds, approval levels, contractor certifications,
coordination and documentation requirements, determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Provide guidance that offers maximum opportunity for innovative contracting approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Avoid the creation of regulations to address every contracting contingency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Provide guidance to contracting officers that encourages risk management rather than risk avoidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Avoid regulations that impose government-unique, unnecessary requirements on federal contractors. Promote
the acquisition of commercial products and reliance on the commercial marketplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Apply a consistent set of drafting conventions so that the FAR will be succinct and understandable to the general
reader.

Second Proposed Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second approach is essentially the same as the first approach with respect to which material would be regulations
and which material would be provided in a nonregulation acquisition manual. However, the nonregulation material
would not be published as a governmentwide manual. Rather, each agency, or group of agencies would be authorized to
publish its own manual containing its own guidance. These manuals would contain a minimal amount of mandatory material
applicable to the internal operations of the agency or necessary to implement the statutes that apply to that agency
or group of agencies. The remainder of the material in the manual would be that as noted in the first approach as nonregulation
in nature and not mandatory. Thus the FAR system would be comprised of the FAR (regulations) and agency acquisition
manuals (nonmandatory guidance and minimal mandatory requirements) that would take the place of current agency
supplements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Model of revised Part 9. The model FAR Part 9 is provided in the appendix to illustrate the first approach being considered
by the Board. Comment only on the approach illustrated by this model rewrite, and not on the content of the model rewrite
on Part 9. FAR Part 9 will be submitted to a committee for revisions in accordance with these Drafting Principles once
the Drafting Principles have been approved. The following model rewrite of FAR Part 9 shows the governmentwide acquisition
manual as it would appear under proposed number one.

Proposed approach number two would follow the same criteria as is followed under proposed approach one to determine
which material is to be codified in the CFR and which material is to appear in nonregulation guidance. However, under
proposed approach number two, the nonregulation guidance would be published by individual agencies in manuals that
apply to contracts issued by that agency.

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>

The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34133 (May 31, 1994), 59 FR 29308 (June
6, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex is amending Section 140 of its Listing Standards and Requirements relating to the fees charged to listed companies
for the original listing of common stock. Specifically, the Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee
applicable to the original listing of stock issues on the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the listing fee for stock issues ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares to more
than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already have
securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers listed
on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50 percent of the rates for U.S. companies, including the $5,000 one-time
charge, with a maximum of $30,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee of $45,000 ($50,000 inclusive of the one-time charge of
$5,000) for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares. In addition, the Exchange is reducing the maximum listing fee
for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from $30,000 to $25,000, inclusive of the one-time charge.

Section 140 is amended to require the following fees:

Less than 1 million shares_$5,000
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15+&blank;&blank;&blank; million shares_$45,000
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above per-share fee, there is a one-time charge of $5,000 for companies that do not have a stock or
warrant issue listed on the Exchange. (The one-time charge of $5,000 does not apply to any company which previously
paid the one-time charge in connection with the listing of a debt issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges, the fee, including the one-time charge, is 50%
of the rates set forth above, with a maximum fee of $25,000. Where the original listing of more than one class of stock
is included in the same application, the fee is based on the aggregate number of shares of all such classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes, based upon discussions with prospect companies, that each year several large companies elect
not to list on the Amex due to the expense of the Exchange's listing fee at the upper end of the fee schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 More specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the
Act which requires that the rules of an exchange assure the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other
charges among members, issuers, and other persons using its facilities. The Commission believes that the reduced
original listing fees for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares are not unfairly discriminatory as proscribed
by Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that adopting a maximum original listing fee for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares
is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in attracting
large companies for listing with its regulatory interests in listing only bona fide companies on the Exchange. For
example, although decreasing listing fees for issues over 15 million shares should attract additional larger issuers
to its market, as well as provide an incentive for current Exchange issuers to list their new issues on the Amex, the
fee amendment will not affect the Amex's quantitative criteria for listing stock on the Exchange. Moreover, the adoption
of a maximum fee provides for a more equitable allocation of listing fees among issuers and should eliminate any disincentive
for large issuers to list on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also believes that reducing the maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock for non-U.S.
companies listed on foreign stock exchanges from $30,000 to $25,000 (inclusive of the $5,000 one-time charge) is
consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in view of the reduction in fees for U.S. companies with issues exceeding
15 million shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approved the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;12) is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Designatronics Incorporated, Common

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
June 29, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designatronics Incorporated (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on June 2, 1994,
to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According
to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility
and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist on the Amex; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's shareholders more liquidity than is
presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Company believes that the NASD/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group
of market makers and expand the capital base available for trading in the Common Stock; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Company believes that the firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASD/NMS system will also
be inclined to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional
research and advisory reports.

Any interested person may, on or before July 21, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars not originally
manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation
into the United States because they are substantially similar to vehicles originally manufactured for importation

U.S.-certified versions of the 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4), and they are capable of being readily modified
to conform to the standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. &sect;1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligiblity determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the

Liphardt &amp; Associates, Inc. of Ronkonkoma, New York (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;004) petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into
the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 19748) to afford an opportunity for
public comment. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. The petition covers
both the 2-wheel drive Carrera 2 and the 4-wheel drive Carrera 4. The notice referred collectively to these vehicles
as the ``1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2/4.'' No comments were received in response to the notice. Based on its review of
the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HOPE for Elderly Independence Program is intended to demonstrate that effectively targeted and tailored supportive
services, coupled with tenant-based rental voucher assistance, can help frail elderly persons continue to live
independently in a cost efficient way and prevent premature or unnecessary institutionalization. Effective delivery
of supportive services is the critical element in a successful program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive services for the frail elderly are coordinated by a PHA through a service coordinator and a professional
assessment committee (PAC). The PAC is competent to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons with
respect to the performance of normal daily living activities. The service coordinator is skilled and trained in dealing
with the frail elderly, is a member of the PAC, and is responsible for assuring, through case management, that program
participants are linked to the supportive services they need to continue independent living. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A service coordinator's training, educational, and work experiences must meet the following minimum guidelines:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A Bachelor of Social Work or degree in a related field such as gerontology, psychology or counseling is preferable;
a college degree is fully acceptable. However, individuals without a degree but with appropriate work experience
may be hired. A PHA may hire a person without a degree, with appropriate justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The service coordinator must be trained in the aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility
for and procedures of federal and applicable State entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing
service coordination, drug and alcohol use and abuse by the elderly, and mental health issues. This requirement is
not a prerequisite for hiring. However, training requirements, if not met at the point of hiring, must be satisfied
within one year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Two years of experience in social services delivery with senior citizens or demonstrated working knowledge of
supportive services and other resources for senior citizens in the jurisdiction where the demonstration is located.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to advocate, problem-solve and provide results for the elderly served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Demonstrated writing and organizational skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A service coordinator performs the following functions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Consults with frail elderly tenants, service providers, owners and other appropriate persons to identify the
particular needs and characteristics of frail elderly persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Builds professional relationships with agencies, service providers and volunteers in the community to secure
ongoing provision of supportive services and other necessary items for the program. Shops to determine the best value
in service pricing to assure individualized, flexible and creative services for the frail elderly. May set up a directory
of service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Screens applicants for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program, reviews any comments from applicants' physicians
and the adequacy of applicants' informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the applicant to
assist in meeting daily living needs), conducts preliminary assessments of frailty, refers potentially eligible
applicants to the PAC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Educates program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability, and client rights
providing advocacy as appropriate. Assists participants in making their own choices, refers and links participants
to service providers. These are, for example, case management, personal assistance, homemaker assistance, meals-on-wheels,
transportation, counseling, occasional visiting nurses, preventive health screening and legal advocacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Helps build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family, with the objective to provide only
those services necessary to maintain independence and to avoid dependence. If necessary, assists participants
with the decision to move to a higher level of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Ensures that the services included in participants' case plans are provided on a regular, ongoing and satisfactory

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the provisions of this NOFA do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA
makes funds available for PHAs to employ or otherwise retain the services of up to one service coordinator for a period
of up to five years in conjunction with the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program. As such, there are no direct implications
on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among various levels of government.

The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(e) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign
power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from
the statute's coverage.

(f) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to
influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those
who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking
of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912) as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule.
