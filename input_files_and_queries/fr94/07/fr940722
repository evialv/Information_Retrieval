SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), amends the regulations relating
to the components of permanent capital for Farm Credit System (Farm Credit or System) banks and associations. The
objective of these regulations is to implement amendments to the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (1971 Act) made by the Farm
Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (1992 Act). The effect of the regulations is to establish
requirements for the agreement between a Farm Credit Bank (FCB) and its related direct lender associations specifying
where the earnings held by the FCB and allocated to associations may be counted as permanent capital, to specify how
these earnings would be counted in the absence of an agreement, to provide a date certain for the exclusion from capital
of payments by Farm Credit institutions to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (FAC) made in
connection with the repayment of Treasury-paid interest, and to make other conforming changes to implement the statutory
amendments. Technical and conforming changes are made throughout the agency's regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 15, 1993, the FCA Board proposed amendments to its regulations that would implement the changes set forth by
the 1992 Act. (See 58 FR 34004, June 23, 1993.) The FCA received comments in response to these proposed regulations
from The Farm Credit Council on behalf of its membership and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, two
Farm Credit Banks (FCBs), a Farm Credit association, and a state bankers' association. These comments were fully
considered by the FCA in drafting the final regulations. The comments and the FCA's response to the comments are discussed
below, along with an explanation of any material changes made to the proposed regulations. In addition, technical
and clarifying changes to language of the proposed regulations have been made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter asserted that some of the proposed regulations, particularly &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A) through
(C) and (E), inject the FCA into the decision making process of the banks and associations as they attempt to develop
agreements that will best fit their business needs. The proposed regulations cited by the commenter pertain to the
time period of the allocation agreement, the effective date, the prohibition on amendments more often than annually
without FCA approval, and the automatic 1-year extension if neither party objects. As is explained in more detail
below, the regulatory requirements were proposed primarily for safety and soundness reasons but also provided for
the administrative convenience of the System institutions and the FCA. The FCA also attempted to provide a framework
that would permit negotiation between banks and associations on an equitable basis. The final regulations contain
modifications to the proposed regulations, including certain deletions of provisions pertaining to administrative
convenience, to the extent the FCA believes appropriate without compromising safety and soundness and fairness
principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asserted that the underlying impact of the proposed regulations was to provide greater flexibility to
the FCBs in competing with private sector lenders and criticized this as contrary to the public good and inconsistent
with the objective of reducing Government's role in the free market. The FCA disagrees. The proposed regulations
do not augment the statutory authority of the FCBs. The ``greater flexibility'' in allocating capital is provided
by the statute and is not expanded by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter stated a belief that the intent of the 1992 Act amendment to section 4.3A(a)(1)(B) of the 1971 Act was to
require FCBs and associations to enter into allocation agreements. The FCA disagrees that the law mandates allocation
agreements and does not believe it is appropriate or feasible to promulgate a regulation forcing nonagreeing associations
and FCBs to enter into agreements. In the event that there is no agreement, the allocation formula provides an orderly
way of determining which institution will count the allocated investment, or any part of it, as permanent capital.

II. Specific Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.5201(a)_Definition of ``Allocated Investment'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested clarification that allocated earnings ``retained by the bank'' means ``not paid in cash.''
This was the intended meaning of the regulation, consistent with the statutory language. The FCA has added clarifying
language in the final regulation.

Section 615.5201(j)(6)_Definition of ``Permanent Capital'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter encouraged the FCA to provide guidelines in the regulations by which the financial assistance provided
by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) would be counted as permanent capital. In addition, the commenter
asserted that the nature of the security, and not the holder of the security, should be the determinant in counting
capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA does not believe it necessary or useful to set forth in the regulations guidelines to be followed by the FCA in
determining how it would count assistance provided by the FCSIC. Since the FCA does not know what form FCSIC assistance
may take, it is impossible to determine at this time whether the assistance would qualify as permanent capital. Moreover,
the FCA disagrees with the comment that the FCSIC should be treated the same as any other security holder in determining
whether FCSIC assistance is permanent capital. The role of the FCSIC as a provider of financial assistance to System
institutions is statutory and unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.5210(d)_Counting of Treasury-Paid Interest as Permanent Capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter stated a belief that the preamble description of proposed &sect;615.5210(d) was inconsistent with the
text of the proposed regulation, in that the preamble indicated that only assessments passed on directly to associations
would be added back to the association's capital (and would not be added back to the bank's capital). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of calculating the permanent capital ratio, it was not the FCA's intention to differentiate between
assessments directly passed on to the associations and assessments passed on ``indirectly (through loan pricing
or otherwise)'' as provided by the statute. Congress apparently contemplated that there would be three possible
ways of paying the cost of assessments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The FCB would not directly or indirectly pass on the cost, even though the ultimate effect would be felt by the associations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The FCB would assess associations directly for an amount based on proportionate average accruing retail loan
volumes of the associations for the preceding year; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The bank would indirectly assess associations by adjusting the interest rate on the direct loan or some other method
based on proportionate average accruing retail loan volumes of each association for the preceding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between method 1 and method 3 is that the ultimate effect of method 1 on an association is in proportion
to the amount of its investment in the bank or its direct loan, whereas method 3's ``cost'' is based on average accruing
retail loan volumes. Changes have been made in the final regulations to clarify that, when an FCB directly assesses
an association (method 2), or when it indirectly assesses an association by specifically identifying the assessment
in other charges made by the FCB to the association (method 3), the amount of the assessment is added back to the capital
of the association (and not to the capital of the bank). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this connection, it is the FCA's view that, while the regulations do not require an FCB to enter into an agreement
with its direct lender associations that would specify whether and how assessments would be passed through, there
are important advantages in having a written understanding. This would clearly document the understandings and
expectations of all parties and would provide more certainty to all parties for business planning and capital building
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked how the amount of assessments passed indirectly to an association is to be reported in the Call Reports
of the institution. The instructions to the Call Reports specify how this is to be done.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommended that the references to ``a percentage allotment'' of the allocated investment be changed
to a ``percentage or other allotment.'' Such a change would, for example, enable an FCB to count the allocated investment
up to a specific percentage of the association's direct loan from the bank. Alternatively, the bank may wish to count
a specified dollar amount of the investment. The FCA believes that an allotment based on a specific dollar amount would
be appropriate but does not believe that the allotment should be tied to floating factors such as the direct loan amount.
The permanent capital ratio is used as one of the key determinants of a Farm Credit institution's financial health
and stability. Allowing permanent capital to move frequently based on floating measures, such as loan volume outstanding,
diminishes the permanent capital ratio's usefulness as a financial measure. If the allotment is left to float, it
could change daily, beyond the control of management. This may not be appropriate during stressful periods in some
institutions.

 Accordingly, the final regulation has been revised to permit only an allocation based on a dollar amount and/or a percentage
of the allocated investment. The amount of allocated investment could be determined based on a dollar amount, and
any earnings that may be distributed could be allotted on a percentage basis. The FCA believes that this permits adequate
flexibility.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(C)_Amendments to Allocation Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters objected to the restrictions in the proposed regulations that would prohibit the reallotment of
the association's investment in the FCB more often than annually without the FCA's approval. While one commenter
acknowledged that the FCA may have a legitimate regulatory concern in curbing the potential abuse of amendments to
manipulate capital ratios, the commenter asserted that FCA prior approval is an inappropriate means of addressing
the concern. In the commenter's view, a prior approval is inconsistent with the FCA's role as an arm's-length regulator,
and without specific criteria for granting approval the FCA could become involved in the business decisions of the
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has reexamined the proposed prior approval procedure and has determined that it would be appropriate to replace
it with a provision enumerating specific circumstances in which a reallotment may be made. Therefore, the final regulations
permit only annual amendments to the allocation agreement, except in the event of a reorganization or merger, or when
a reallotment is required to enable the FCB to make payments in connection with the Capital Preservation Agreements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA strongly believes that the more frequently an allocated investment ``moves'' in the computation of the permanent
capital ratio, the less reliable the permanent capital ratio is as an indicator of the financial soundness of an institution
or of trends in the institution's operations. Consequently, one of the most important uses of the minimum permanent
capital standard would be eliminated if institutions were permitted to change their allotments frequently and at
will. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other than in the context of a merger or other corporate reorganization of one of the parties, when a reallotment would
likely be necessary, or when a reallotment is necessary to enable the FCB to make payments in connection with the Capital
Preservation Agreements, the FCA is aware of only a limited number of situations in which there would be any incentive
for the institutions to reallot capital. For example, as part of its examinations, the FCA makes evaluations of the
capital adequacy of each institution. The FCA is concerned that, if a reallotment is permitted as often as desired,
it would be permissible to reallot capital in the time period between the examination of an FCB and an affiliated association
for the benefit of the institution to be examined next. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, since the lending limit of an institution is based on the amount of its permanent capital, it would also be
permissible to temporarily reallot capital to enable an institution to make a loan that would otherwise be in excess
of its lending limits. Similarly, an institution could reallot capital in order to retire stock that it would otherwise
be unable to retire, or even attempt to forestall an enforcement action by the FCA based on insufficient permanent
capital. Although these matters could be viewed by institutions as ``internal business decisions,'' they raise
safety and soundness and other issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, as a policy matter, the FCA views frequent changes in where the capital is counted as undesirable. The
FCA believes that it is more efficacious to prevent the possibility of manipulation by regulation rather than to examine
institutions to determine, after the fact, if such manipulation of their capital has occurred.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A)_Effective Date of Allocation Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A) provided that all of the allocation agreements would become effective at
the start of the second quarter of each year. A commenter stated that there was no need for delay in implementing the
agreement and noted that many districts currently implement the agreement on a calendar year basis. The commenter
also stated the opinion that the effective date of these agreements is a procedural matter that ought to be left to the
discretion of the parties and should be controlled by the business needs and planning processes of the affected institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date proposed by the regulations was set, for the convenience of the parties, as the quarter following the allocation
of earnings from the FCBs to associations so that the actual dollar amount of the allocation would be known when the
allotment was being determined. In addition, setting a specific date would have facilitated the FCA's oversight
of institutions. However, upon reconsideration, the FCA believes that the requirement to file a copy of the agreement
with the responsible FCA examination field office will be sufficient to enable the agency to fulfill its oversight
responsibilities. The final regulations permit banks and associations to select any date as the effective date of
their agreement, provided that such date is no less than 12 months after the effective date of the existing agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(D) required an allocation agreement to be sent to the FCA and any nonparty associations
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, associations that were not parties to that allocation agreement) in the district within 3 days after the agreement
was signed. A commenter asked that the time period be increased from 3 days to 20 business days, stating that this would
enable a district with many associations to submit all of the agreements in one mailing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has reconsidered the proposal and has determined that a more flexible filing requirement would be less burdensome
to the banks and associations, without compromising the FCA's ability to monitor the capital strength of the institutions.
The final regulation deletes the 3-day FCA filing requirement and provides, instead, that a certified copy of the
agreement must be filed with the appropriate FCA field office on or before the effective date of the agreement, and
that copies of agreements must be sent to other associations in the district within 30 calendar days of signing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested assurance that the allocation agreement could consist of a contract, an exchange of board resolutions,
or an incorporation of the terms of the agreement into the business plans of the institutions. The commenter is correct
that any of the means described would be appropriate.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(E)_Notification to the FCA of Objection to the Extension of an Allocation Agreement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(E) provided that the allocation agreement would be automatically extended
for another year if not amended and if neither party to the agreement notifies the FCA of its objection to the continuation
of the agreement at least 30 days before the expiration date. A commenter suggested that the notification to the FCA
be made in writing. The FCA agrees that this notification should be made in writing, and the final regulations include
this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also stated that the agreement itself should govern such matters as termination and extension rather
than the regulations. The FCA has considered this comment and agrees in principle that the bank and association should
be free to provide in their agreement for such matters as termination and extension. However, the FCA also believes
that it is appropriate to provide for an automatic extension of the agreement if the matter has not been addressed in
the agreement. The final regulations reflect this change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter asked for clarification of whether permanent capital ratios for the default allocation formula would
be computed in proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(F) using a 3-month average daily balance, as the regulations
otherwise require for permanent capital ratio computations. The ratios would be computed in the same manner in this
circumstance, using a 3-month average daily balance, and the final regulations contain this clarification. The
regulations further provide that the permanent capital computations must be calculated as of the expiration date
of the existing agreement.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(G)_Reallotment in Connection With Payments Relating to Capital Preservation Agreements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(G) required a bank and one or more associations to amend their agreement in order
to reallot the allocated investment if such reallotment would enable the FCB to make its Capital Preservation Agreement
annuity payment and still meet minimum permanent capital standards. However, it did not specify a basis to determine
which associations must amend their agreements. A commenter recommended that the regulations require that the allocation
agreements provide for such reallotment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA agrees with the commenter and believes that this issue would be appropriately provided for in the allocation
agreements as suggested. The final regulations include a provision requiring the issue to be addressed in the allocation
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that, in addition to the preferred stock that System institutions are presently authorized
to issue, subordinated notes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate-term preferred stock be allowed to be counted as permanent capital. The commenter suggested that such
issues be limited to 25 percent of total capital so that an institution would not be able to rely principally on this
source. Another commenter expressed an opinion that the use of debt instruments as a substitute for capital would
undermine the safety and soundness of the System and, therefore, opposed that part of the proposal. Yet another commenter
stated that debt securities should be included in permanent capital if they are counted on a discounted or sinking
fund basis. These proposals are still under consideration by the FCA and will be addressed in future proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has deleted from the definition of permanent capital the reference to preferred stock issued to the FAC, since
all such stock has now been retired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed regulations inadvertently eliminated a provision of existing &sect;615.5210(d)(3)
regarding investments made in connection with loan participations. That provision states that, where an institution
invests in another institution to capitalize a participation interest, the investing institution must deduct from
its total capital an amount equal to its investment in the participating institution. The proposed regulations addressed
situations where an institution invested in a bank for any purpose, including to capitalize a loan participation,
but did not address any situation where a bank or association invested in another association (to capitalize a loan
participation or for any other purpose). The provision from the existing regulations has been revised to apply only
to investments in associations and restored as &sect;615.5210(e)(5) in the final regulations, and the succeeding
paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly. Furthermore, proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(3) has been revised and
a new paragraph (e)(4) has been added to clarify that all earnings allocated by a bank to a recipient will count as permanent
capital of the bank in the absence of an allocation agreement, except when the bank is a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural
credit bank and the recipient is a Farm Credit association, in which case the default allotment formula would apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, these regulations include amendments to parts 607, 614, 615 (subpart E), and 620 of the regulations. These
changes, as more fully described below, are conforming and clarifying changes to provisions containing references
to existing capital regulations that are now covered by various provisions of new &sect;&sect;615.5201 and 615.5210(d),
(e), and (f). The FCA has determined that the notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (c) do not apply
in this situation. Notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary because the amendments are not substantive
in nature and do not impose new requirements. Therefore, there is no reason to solicit public comments on them. Accordingly,
the FCA finds that good cause exists to promulgate final amendments to these provisions without notice and comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes have been made to the capital regulation references in &sect;614.4351(a) to account primarily
for the renumbering of paragraphs. The references to revised paragraph (e) (2), (3), and (4) of &sect;615.5210, replace
the reference to paragraph (d)(2) of that section in the existing regulations. While the methodology in amended &sect;614.4351(a)
for computing an institution's lending limit base will be somewhat different, and in some cases more complicated,
because of the amendments to the capital regulations, the effect will be the same.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 To facilitate institutions' understanding and interpretation of the lending limit calculation, the language describing
the calculation has been clarified regarding the sequence of the adjustments and regarding which institution will
count the investment in question in its lending limit base. We note, in this connection, that the ``investment'' includes
any equities that are purchased as well as equities that are allocated in a distribution of earnings on participations.
The FCA is considering how the calculation might be simplified and will publish for comment any proposed substantive
changes that may be appropriate.

In other words, the revised &sect;614.4351(a) will continue to require that an investment held to capitalize a loan
participation interest sold to another institution will be included in the lending limit base of the institution
that holds the investment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

regulations relating to the elimination of certain investments for the purpose of calculating a limit on bankers
acceptances for a bank for cooperatives, the actual referenced language has been inserted as an aid to the reader.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the conforming amendments in &sect;&sect;607.2, 615.5131(t), and 620.1(j) have been made to reflect the
renumbering of existing capital provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) On or before the effective date of the agreement, a certified copy of the agreement, and any amendments thereto,
shall be sent to the field office of the Farm Credit Administration responsible for examining the institution. A copy
shall also be sent within 30 calendar days of adoption to the bank's other affiliated associations.

with which there is no agreement (nonagreeing associations), and shall not be applied to the allocated investments
held by those associations with which the bank has an agreement (agreeing associations):

needed by the bank, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association shall be multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator is the amount of capital needed by the bank and whose denominator is the total amount of allocated investments
of the nonagreeing associations, and such amount shall be allotted to the bank. Next, if the permanent capital ratio
of any nonagreeing association is less than 7 percent, a sufficient amount of unallotted allocated investment shall
then be allotted to each nonagreeing association, as necessary, to increase its permanent capital ratio to 7 percent,

(G) If a payment or part of a payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation pursuant to section
6.9(e)(3)(D)(ii) of the Act would cause a bank to fall below its minimum permanent capital requirement, the bank and
one or more associations shall amend their allocation agreements to increase the allotment of the allocated investment
to the bank sufficiently to enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation,
provided that the associations would continue to meet their minimum permanent capital requirement. In the case of
a nonagreeing association, the Farm Credit Administration may require a revision of the allotment sufficient to
enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, provided that the
association would continue to meet its minimum permanent capital requirement. The Farm Credit Administration Board
may, at the request of one or more of the institutions affected, waive the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(G)
if the Board deems it is in the overall best interest of the institutions affected.

(3) A Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and a recipient, other than an association, of allocated earnings
from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's

of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that, in the absence of an agreement, the allocated investment shall be
allotted 100 percent to the allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All equities of the bank that are purchased
by a recipient shall be considered as permanent capital of the issuing bank.

(4) A bank for cooperatives and a recipient of allocated earnings from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying
a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the bank and

percent to the recipient. All equities of a bank that are purchased by a recipient shall be considered as permanent

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts a final rule concerning
director and senior officer compensation. The regulation amends the director compensation regulations to reflect
changes to the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act) made by the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act
of 1992 (1992 Amendments),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and amends the annual report disclosure rules for director reimbursable expenses to address concerns raised by Farm
Credit banks regarding the equity and regulatory burden of the existing rule. Additionally, the rule amends the disclosure
requirements for senior officer compensation to make the disclosures more informative and useful to shareholders.

1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA published a proposed rule concerning director and senior officer compensation and reimbursable expense
disclosures on December 23, 1993 (58 FR 68069). The comment period closed January 24, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 611.400, concerning bank director compensation, is adopted substantially as proposed with the exception
that the cap on the amount by which the FCA Board would consider waiving the statutory limitation on bank director compensation
for exceptional circumstances has been increased from 25 to 30 percent. Section 618.8270, regarding the reimbursement
of travel, subsistence, and related expenses, has been modified by reducing several of the policy and procedure requirements
originally proposed. The final rule retains the requirement that each Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institution
develop a written policy regarding the reimbursement of travel, subsistence, and other related expenses to its directors,
officers, and employees and provide stockholders with a brief description of the policy. Substantial changes have
been made to the proposed senior officer compensation disclosure requirements in &sect;620.5(i)(2). The final
rule requires FCS institutions to disclose: (1) Individual compensation information of chief executive officers
(CEOs) whose annualized salary and bonus exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI); and (2) aggregate compensation information of all senior officers as a group. Both the CEO and aggregate
senior officer compensation information is required to be reported for each of the last 3 fiscal years and presented
in a Summary Compensation Table. The final rule retains the requirement that the institutions provide a discussion
of compensation plans. Finally, a provision was added to allow associations the option of disclosing senior officer
compensation information in either the Association Annual Meeting Information Statement or the annual report.

II. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA received 140 comment letters from the Farm Credit Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership, 7 Farm Credit Banks,
3 Banks for Cooperatives, 122 associations, and 7 shareholders. Commenters expressed strong opposition to the proposed
disclosure of individual compensation information for each of the five most highly paid senior officers. The following
discussion focuses on the FCA response to commenters' concerns regarding the proposed senior officer disclosures
as this was the predominant issue raised in their letters. The section-by-section discussion also addresses other
comments received on the proposed rule.

A. Basis for Senior Officer Compensation Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that FCS institutions are not parallel to commercial banks or thrifts, or analogous to other Government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs). Therefore, commenters adamantly believe that FCS institutions should not be required to make
similar executive compensation disclosures. Commenters stressed four main points in support of their position.
First, the compensation disclosure requirements for commercial banks, national banks, thrift institutions, and
state member banks are applicable only to financial institutions subject to the registration requirements of section
12(b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, equity securities in FCS institutions are owned only by borrowing members of the institutions, not purchased
primarily for investment, and not publicly traded. Thus, the investor concerns addressed by the 1934 Act are not present
in the case of FCS institutions. Third, although formally exempt from the registration requirements of the 1934 Act,
other GSEs report as if they were subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statutes, in part, because their
securities are subject to the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Fourth, the disclosures provide
limited benefits to investors in FCS debt obligations because the banks are jointly and severally liable on these
obligations. Consequently, investors generally rely on the strength of the System as a whole. Rather, commenters
contend it would be more appropriate, in their judgment, for the FCA to compare the treatment of FCS institutions under
the proposed rule to Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and credit unions, as the ownership structures of those entities
more closely parallel those of the FCS banks and direct lender associations. Unlike commercial banks and thrifts,
credit unions and FHLBs are not subject to executive compensation disclosures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Public companies with at least 500 shareholders of record and assets of at least $5,000,000 must register with the
SEC pursuant to SEC regulations implementing the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA agrees with commenters that a comparison of ownership structures between FCS institutions and credit unions
and FHLBs has some validity, and that FCS institutions are notably different from commercial banks, thrifts and other
GSEs. Nevertheless, the FCA did not intend to imply or draw a direct parallel between FCS institutions and any other
type of financial institution or to use a comparison between the institutions as the sole basis for establishing or
modifying the senior officer compensation disclosure requirements. The primary comparison being made was that
the FCA's proposed compensation disclosure requirements were similar in many respects to those imposed on commercial
banks and thrifts by other regulators. As stated in the proposed rule, the FCA believes that more detailed compensation
disclosures, such as those imposed by the SEC, would satisfy the objectives of section 514 of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and the proposed disclosures would benefit FCS shareholders by providing them with senior officer compensation
information that was comparable to that available to shareholders of other financial institutions. The proposed
disclosure requirements were still, however, markedly less extensive than those established by the SEC, partly
due to the many differences between commercial banks and FCS institutions. The final regulations deviate further
from the SEC's compensation disclosure requirements in consideration of the uniqueness of the FCS institutions.
For example, the $100,000 compensation threshold established by the SEC for individual senior officer compensation
disclosure was one area where the FCA chose to differ. Instead, the FCA decided to adopt a $150,000 compensation disclosure
threshold that applies only to FCS institution CEOs.

The stated objective of section 514 is ``to ensure that information reported by directors, officers, and employees
of Farm Credit System institutions under regulations of the Farm Credit Administration requiring the disclosure
of financial information and reporting of potential conflicts of interests_(1) provides the stockholders of all
Farm Credit System institutions with information to assist the stockholders in making informed decisions regarding
the operations of the institutions; (2) provides investors and potential investors with information necessary
to make investment decisions regarding Farm Credit System obligations or institutions; and (3) provides the Farm
Credit Administration with information necessary to allow the Farm Credit Administration to effectively and efficiently
examine and regulate all Farm Credit System institutions and thus enhance the safety and soundness of the System.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA's rationale for requiring director and senior officer compensation disclosures stems primarily from the
``at-risk'' nature of the stock and the significant number and wide distribution of shareholders, which are similar
attributes to those of financial institutions with publicly traded stock. In terms of assets, the size of many FCS
institutions is comparable to, and sometimes greater than, financial institutions whose equity and debt securities
are widely held by the public. In addition, even if commenters are correct in their assertion that investors of FCS
debt obligations are more concerned with the System as a whole, the FCA believes that the investor concerns addressed
by the 1934 Act are not completely absent as suggested by commenters. Regardless of their motivation for purchasing
the stock, borrowers make a financial investment in FCS institutions and obtain the right to participate in the affairs
of those institutions. Shareholders can potentially benefit from their investment in terms of dividends and patronage
refunds. Thus, shareholders need sufficient information to make intelligent decisions about the management and
operation of the institutions in which they have invested and to hold directors and management accountable for their
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA stated in the preamble to the shareholder disclosure regulations published on June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21337) that
while not all FCS institutions would meet the test for public companies, many of them have in excess of 500 shareholders,
and the number of institutions with fewer than 500 shareholders continues to decline in conjunction with the trend
toward mergers. Further, the FCA stated that while the stock is not publicly traded on the secondary market, it is held
by over 900,000 individuals and business entities that have a common interest in the financial and operating information
of the institutions. The FCA Board continues to believe that the distinction between holding stock for investment
and holding stock for doing business with an institution does not have a material bearing on the right of shareholders
to have access to information in order to make informed decisions. Therefore, the final compensation disclosure
requirements continue to place CEOs of FCS institutions with a significant amount of assets and number of shareholders
under the same scrutiny as CEOs of financial institutions with publicly traded stock subject to the registration
requirements of the 1934 Act.

B. Section 514 of the 1992 Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA agrees with the commenters that section 514 is quite broad and its interpretation, as it applies to compensation
disclosures, is a matter of the FCA's discretion. Commenters stated that nothing in section 514 of the 1992 Amendments
compels the disclosure of individualized senior officer compensation or concludes that the current disclosure
requirements are inadequate in any respect. They felt strongly that the existing disclosure of senior officer compensation
in the aggregate, coupled with the requirement that shareholders may request the individual compensation of any
senior officer, or any other individual included in the aggregate whose compensation exceeds $50,000, was adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no intention in the proposed rule to suggest that section 514 mandates individual disclosure of senior officer
compensation. In section 514, Congress stressed the importance of disclosure of compensation paid to, loans made
to, and transactions made with FCS institutions by directors and senior officers of the institution. Congress also
directed the FCA to review its regulations to ensure that they meet the purpose of the section and applicable laws,
but did not prescribe any specific regulation amendments. After reviewing its regulations, the FCA concluded that
more detailed senior officer compensation disclosures satisfied the spirit and intent of section 514.

C. Board Accountability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern that providing individual compensation information would undermine the board's
authority and its ability to effectively administer the institution's salary administration program. Further,
commenters asserted that the disclosure rule would dilute the board's responsibility and shift the oversight responsibility
from the board of directors to the shareholders as a whole.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA Board disagrees that disclosure of information undermines board accountability and responsibility. In
fact, disclosure of senior officer compensation is intended to promote board accountability to shareholders rather
than shift board responsibility to shareholders. The objective of this type of disclosure is to provide shareholders
with information to assess whether senior officer compensation is appropriate in view of the institution's financial
condition and performance and to hold the board accountable for maintaining a reasonable rationale for the level
of compensation paid to its senior officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Invasion of Privacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although numerous reasons were cited in opposition to individualized compensation disclosure, no other issue generated
the intense reaction created by concerns of ``invasion of privacy.'' Respondents were highly concerned that the
disclosure of potentially sensitive information in a public format, such as the annual report, would cause considerable
staff dissension and would render management unable to effectively administer the institutions' salary programs.
One commenter stated that disclosure of the individual salaries of the five highest paid senior officers will, more
than likely, cause salaries to gravitate to the highest paid levels in order to maintain morale rather than ``limit''
compensation paid to senior officers. Several commenters expressed concern that the disclosures may cause employee
flight. Additionally, some FCS associations were concerned that the individual compensation disclosures may inadvertently
reach the branch officer level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA recognizes that internal conflict may be generated when the information presented is used by parties for purposes
for which they were not intended, such as a means for co-workers to compare salaries or to use as a bargaining tool for
salary negotiations. The FCA also believes, however, that management is ultimately responsible for maintaining
employee morale and retaining competent staff through fair and reasonable compensation, and for communicating
to staff how this is accomplished through the salary administration program. A primary aspect of the disclosures
is to provide shareholders insight regarding the methodology and basis the boards use to determine what they consider
to be ``fair and reasonable'' compensation, rather than to ``limit'' senior officer compensation as suggested by
a commenter. Further, the FCA believes stockholders have valid reasons to have this type of information readily available
to them and they should not be penalized because of the potential for internal conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters were opposed to the proposed disclosures because FCS institution annual reports are used as marketing
tools, among other things, and made available to a wide spectrum of interested parties. Some commenters believed
that the broad distribution of the reports could promote animosity among shareholders and employees throughout
the FCS and possibly other members of rural communities. Several commenters also stated that in order to evaluate
the reasonableness of individual senior officer compensation, shareholders would need to understand several key
aspects of the employer/employee relationship, such as the experience and knowledge an employee brings to his/her
job, geographical cost-of-living data, market compensation for similar positions, job responsibilities, and
the competitive and regulatory environment in which the employee operates. Commenters also asserted that providing
just a dollar amount of compensation, without any other relevant data, would be interpreted by the readers of the annual
report in terms of their own frame of reference. This could easily lead to confusion and ill feelings among employees
and shareholders because they are not provided with all the facts involved in determining an individual's compensation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA disagrees that shareholders would be unable to understand and assess the senior officer compensation disclosures.
In addition to reporting ``dollar amounts'' of compensation paid, institutions are required to provide a discussion
of the compensation plans to aid the reader's understanding of the disclosures. Moreover, nothing in the regulations
prevents an institution from providing explanations of the market or any other factors used in the determination
of compensation. Management always has the discretion to provide such explanations if they feel they are needed to
fairly portray the amounts being paid to senior officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA Board recognizes that it should, to the extent possible, balance shareholders' needs to receive meaningful
information concerning their institutions and individual privacy concerns. As expressed in the FCA Board's Policy
Statement on Regulatory Philosophy, ``The FCA Board is mindful that most regulatory activities will involve competing
considerations and is committed to considering and weighing those competing considerations and arriving at thoughtful
regulatory judgments''. (Published June 22, 1994 at 59 FR 32189) Therefore, in reaching a balance between the competing
considerations regarding the proposed regulation, substantial modifications were made to the senior officer disclosure
requirements and are more fully explained in the section-by-section discussion.

III. Section-by-Section Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 611.400_Compensation of Bank Board Members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters generally expressed support for proposed &sect;611.400, Bank Director Compensation. The FCC stated
that the proposed procedure for adjusting the bank directors' compensation ceiling and the approval process for
exceeding the statutory limitation in ``exceptional circumstances'' seemed to be both fair and well-considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA is adopting the amendments to &sect;611.400 as proposed with two modifications. The proposed rule included
a 25-percent cap on the amount by which the FCA Board would approve a waiver of the statutory limitation on bank director
compensation. The FCA received two requests for waivers of the statutory limitation since publishing the proposed
rule. Based on its operational experience in reviewing those requests, the FCA Board determined that a 30-percent
cap on the amount by which it would approve waivers of the statutory limitation would be more appropriate. In addition,
the requirement in proposed &sect;611.400(c)(3) that the FCA respond to requests for waivers of the statutory limitation
within 30 days was modified by extending the agency's self-imposed response time to 60 days. The FCA will respond to
requests for waivers as quickly as possible and anticipates replying to the vast majority of requests in well under
60 days. Nevertheless, there may be unusual circumstances that would necessitate a longer period to gather and analyze
pertinent information related to the request, and the longer response period should reduce the frequency of formal
extensions of the response period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA recognizes the difficulty in predicting all the exceptional circumstances under which a bank may desire to
seek a waiver of the statutory limitation on bank director compensation. Therefore, the FCA would like to clarify
that &sect;611.400(d)(3), pertaining to a bank's policy on bank director compensation, need only address exceptional
circumstances that the bank's board is able to identify. The policy should also include a procedure for evaluating,
on a case-by-case basis, other extraordinary circumstances that may arise where the bank's board would consider
seeking a waiver of the limitation.

B. Section 618.8270_Travel, Subsistence, and Other Related Expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally supported proposed &sect;618.8270, but challenged whether the level of detail in policy and
procedure requirements was necessary. The FCC commended the FCA Board for its openmindedness and willingness to
reconsider the existing requirement for individual disclosure of bank director reimbursable expenses and replace
it with an aggregate disclosure requirement. The FCC and other commenters stated that while it is quite appropriate
for the FCA to require each FCS institution's board to develop written policies concerning the reimbursement of travel,
subsistence, and other related expenses, the details of such policies should be left to each board's discretion.
In their judgment, the degree of detail spelled out in proposed &sect;618.8270(a) constitutes micro-management,
which they believed the current FCA Board was seeking to remove from the regulations. Another commenter responded
that the administrative burden created by the detailed policy requirements, documentation, reporting, and auditing
is not supported by the value, if any, that would be added to the stockholder disclosure process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February 1994, subsequent to publication of the proposed regulations, the FCA Board adopted the previously mentioned
Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy (59 FR 32189, June 22, 1994) that stated ``It is the FCA Board's philosophy
to promulgate regulations that are necessary to implement the law and to promote the safety and soundness of the Farm
Credit System.'' One method cited for achieving the FCA Board's regulatory objective was to issue regulations, to
the extent feasible, that specify performance criteria and objectives rather than operational methods for achieving
its purposes. In light of this recently adopted position, the FCA reevaluated proposed &sect;618.8270 and made modifications
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The examples of guidelines and limitations that an institution may consider addressing in their travel policy (i.e.,
modes of transportation; mileage rates for use of personal vehicles and per diem allowances, including maximum or
limitations on lodging, meals and incidental expenses; and telephone calls and any other miscellaneous expenses)
were eliminated from the final rule. The examples cited in proposed &sect;618.8270(a)(2)(i) through (iv) were removed
because many commenters interpreted them as mandatory regulatory requirements. However, the FCA Board continues
to believe that the management of each FCS institution should determine to what extent the individual items cited
as sample guidelines and limitations in the proposed rule are necessary to ensure that the reimbursement of expenses
for directors, officers, and employees is reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain aspects of proposed &sect;618.8270 that incorporated, in part, procedures from existing &sect;611.400(b)
and (c) were eliminated from the final rule. The FCA Board believes that such detailed operating procedures should
remain at the discretion of each FCS institution's management rather than be formally prescribed by regulations.
Therefore, all of the procedures in proposed &sect;618.8270(a)(3) and (4) were removed and the basic requirement
for maintaining written records of expense reimbursements was assimilated into final &sect;618.8270(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the last sentence in &sect;618.8270(b) referring to ``the personnel authorized
to process reimbursements,'' be amended by substituting ``approve'' for ``process.'' The commenter asserted that
the persons who normally process reimbursements are accounting clerks, and stated that it is not usually part of their
function to attempt to determine whether expenses are appropriate. In an effort to clarify the regulation, the last
sentence was stricken from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters misinterpreted proposed &sect;618.8270(c) to require that an internal auditor review every expense
claim and record. The FCA has clarified that the regulation only requires an internal auditor to determine whether
the institution's policies and procedures are being consistently followed by testing the reimbursement process
through a sampling of expense claims and records. The final rule reads that ``Each board shall require a review by the
institution's internal auditor (or person designated by the board) of at least a sampling of records maintained *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Furthermore, the requirement for an internal audit review of travel records is now contained in &sect;618.8270(b)
in the final rule.

C. Section 620.5(i)_Compensation of Directors and Senior Officers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Director compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disclosure requirements in the final regulation remain unchanged from the proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Senior officer compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The senior officer compensation disclosure requirements were substantially changed in the final regulation. As
previously discussed, the modifications were made because the FCA Board considered it important to balance commenters'
privacy concerns with the shareholders' need for access to pertinent information regarding their institutions,
and to further reflect the unique attributes of FCS institutions in the regulations. In addition, technical and clarifying
changes were made to improve the understanding of the requirements and enhance the consistency of the disclosures
presented to shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative means for associations to disseminate senior officer compensation information was added to the final
rule. Many commenters asserted that the disclosure of compensation information is more appropriate for a proxy statement.
To address this issue, final &sect;620.5(i)(2) permits associations to disclose senior officer compensation information
in either the Association Annual Meeting Information Statement (AAMIS) or the annual report. By allowing associations
to disclose compensation information in the AAMIS, the FCA Board aims to reduce the concern of wide distribution of
potentially sensitive information in a public format. Currently, there is no other disclosure medium for banks that
serves a similar purpose as the AAMIS. Thus, the banks would continue to publish senior officer compensation in the
annual report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule limits the requirement for disclosure of individual compensation information to FCS institution
CEOs. Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i), which would have required institutions to make individual compensation
disclosure for each of the five highest compensated senior officers, was dropped from the final rule. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(A)
requires FCS institutions to report the total compensation and the amount of each component of compensation paid
to the institution's CEO for each of the last 3 completed fiscal years. If more than one person served in the capacity
of CEO during any given fiscal year, individual compensation information must be reported for each CEO. However,
no disclosure need be provided for any CEO whose salary and bonus (or annualized salary and bonus, if the CEO served
in that capacity less than a year) do not exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) for all urban consumers. The 1994 calendar year will serve as the base year for making subsequent CPI adjustments
to the $150,000 disclosure threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(ii), which would have required FCS institutions to report the aggregate amount of compensation
and the components of compensation paid to all officers as a group, was revised in the final regulation. The FCA did
not perceive the proposed requirement as markedly different from the existing aggregate senior officer compensation
disclosure requirement. Yet, several commenters interpreted the requirement to be more extensive. The FCA decided
to retain the language in the existing rule with some modifications to reduce any ambiguity that may have been raised
by the proposed requirement. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(B) requires institutions to report the aggregate amount
of compensation and the components of compensation paid during each of the last 3 completed fiscal years to all senior
officers as a group, stating the number of officers in the group without naming them. As with the existing regulation,
at a minimum, institutions must disclose the aggregate amount of compensation paid to the five most highly compensated
officers, whether or not designated as a senior officer by the board.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A requirement for preparation of a ``Summary Compensation Table'' (table) was added to the final regulation to enhance
the comparability of the compensation disclosures. Commenters indicated there was a need to improve the consistency
of reporting compensation information and suggested the regulations stipulate a format for disclosure. In response,
the general definition of ``compensation'' was eliminated and replaced by the more descriptive table and corresponding
instructions. For purposes of reporting compensation information in the table, compensation is divided into two
main categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``Annual;'' and (2) ``Other.'' The separation is to distinguish normal annual compensation from compensation
that is unusual, infrequent, reflects special circumstances, or is earned during the fiscal year but is not usually
available to the senior officer until a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The components of ``Annual'' compensation include salary, bonuses, deferred compensation and perquisites. Amounts
shown as ``salary'' and ``bonus'' are to reflect the gross amounts earned during the fiscal year before any reductions
for amounts contributed during the fiscal year to a 401(k) plan or similar plan. If, for any reason, the exact amount
of salary or bonus earned in the fiscal year is not expected to be known in time for its inclusion in the report, the institution
is to include in the report its best estimate of the compensation amount and provide appropriate footnote disclosure
with the table. Amounts shown as ``deferred/perquisites'' will include such items as deferred compensation, perquisites,
and any other significant personal benefits customarily paid, earned or received on an annual basis. With respect
to deferred compensation, this amount should reflect all forms of deferred compensation earned during the fiscal
year, whether or not paid in cash. For example, if the deferred compensation was earned during the period but payment
in cash was voluntarily deferred by the senior officer to a later period (e.g., upon retirement) the amount earned
must still be included in the current period's compensation amount. Consequently, cash payments under deferred
compensation arrangements where the amounts were earned in previous periods would not be included as part of the current
period's compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The category depicted as ``Other'' in the table includes amounts not appropriately characterized as components
of annual compensation. Section 620.5(i)(2)(i)(E) specifies two forms of compensation that should be included
in this category: (1) Compensation in the form of payouts due to a senior officer's resignation, retirement, or termination
from employment; and (2) contributions by the institution on behalf of the senior officer to a defined contribution
plan for which cash payments from the plan are typically not available to the senior officer until a later date. Any
form of compensation in this part must be specifically identified and described in a footnote to the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA received a mixed response to proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii), which would have required FCS institutions
to provide a general discussion of compensation plans of its senior officers. While many commenters supported the
proposed requirement, others believed that the disclosures would be too burdensome to compile. The FCA Board continues
to believe that such discussion would be beneficial in providing explanations of compensation plans to the readers
of the report. For the most part, the final regulation retains the requirements in proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii)
that FCS institutions provide a description of the compensation plans of all those senior officers covered by the
regulations. Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii) (F) and (G), which would have required institutions to discuss the
amounts paid under the plans, were dropped from the final rule because the final rule requires these comments to be
disclosed in the table. The remaining compensation discussion requirements are now contained in &sect;620.5(i)(2)(ii)
in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule clarifies that bank senior officer compensation information is part of the financial information
that should be made available to shareholders of both the bank and its related associations upon request. When the
disclosure regulations in part 620 of this chapter were initially adopted, the FCA determined that, due to the structure
of the System and the impact the banks have on the financial results of the associations, there was a need for association
shareholders to receive the financial information of the bank in addition to the financial information of the association.
Existing &sect;620.4(b) implements this philosophy by requiring banks to distribute their annual reports to shareholders
of related associations. Likewise, under the proposed rule, both the shareholders of the bank and related associations
would have received the bank's annual report containing individual compensation information on the five most highly
compensated bank senior officers. Although the disclosure requirement for individual senior officer compensation
information was limited to CEOs in the final rule, the FCA Board continues to believe that it is important for shareholders
of related associations to have access to individual compensation information of bank senior officers included
in the aggregate disclosure required by &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the required disclosure statement in proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iv) was modified to clarify its requirements
and is now contained in &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii) in the final rule. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii) requires institutions
to include a statement in the annual report or the AAMIS (if the association chooses to include compensation information
in the AAMIS) that ``information concerning the total compensation paid during the last fiscal year to any senior
officer or to any other officer included in the aggregate whose compensation exceeds $50,000 is available and will
be disclosed to shareholders of the institution and shareholders of related associations (if applicable) upon request.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The disclosure requirements for travel, subsistence, and other related expenses in the final regulation remain
unchanged from the proposed regulation with one exception. Pursuant to the preceding discussion, the final rule
clarifies that the institution's policy regarding travel, subsistence, and other related expenses should also
be made available to shareholders of related associations (if applicable) upon request.

(a) Farm Credit System banks are authorized to pay fair and reasonable compensation to directors for services performed
in an official capacity at a rate not to exceed the level established in section 4.21 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as
amended, unless the FCA determines that such a level adversely affects the safety and soundness of the institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The bank director compensation level established in section 4.21 of the Act shall be adjusted to reflect changes
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the following
manner: Current year's maximum compensation = Prior year's maximum compensation adjusted by the prior year's annual
average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. Adjustments will be made to the bank director statutory
compensation limit beginning from October 28, 1992 (the date of enactment of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations
Safety and Soundness Act of 1992). Additionally, each year the FCA will distribute a bookletter to all FCS banks that
communicates the CPI adjusted bank director statutory compensation limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A waiver of the compensation limitation prescribed by section 4.21 of the Act may be granted under exceptional
circumstances as approved on a case-by-case basis by the FCA. However, the FCA shall not grant a waiver that allows
a bank to pay any director in excess of 30 percent more than the statutory maximum compensation as determined in accordance
with paragraph (b) of this section. A waiver approval shall precede any payments by the bank to its director(s) that
exceed the maximum limitation determined in paragraph (b) of this section. A bank seeking a waiver shall provide the
FCA Chairman with a written request that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Describes and explains the exceptional circumstance(s) that the bank believes necessitates a waiver of section
4.21 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) States the amount and the terms and conditions (if any) of the proposed compensation level for each director that
would exceed the statutory maximum determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Justifies the compensation level of each director that would exceed the statutory limitation based on the extraordinary
time and service devoted to bank business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA shall respond to written requests within 60 days of receipt of the preceding information and the receipt of
any other additional information requested by the FCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each bank board shall adopt a written policy regarding compensation of bank directors. The policy shall address,
at a minimum, the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The activities or functions for which attendance is necessary and appropriate and may be compensated, except
that a Farm Credit System bank shall not compensate any director for rendering services on behalf of any other Farm
Credit System institution or a cooperative of which the director is a member, or for performing other assignments
of a non-official nature;

(A) Report the total amount of compensation paid and the amount of each component of compensation paid to the institution's
chief executive officer (CEO) for each of the last 3 completed fiscal years, naming the individual. If more than one
person served in the capacity of CEO during any given fiscal year, individual compensation disclosures must be provided
for each CEO. Except that, no disclosure need be provided for any CEO whose salary and bonus (or annualized salary and
bonus, if the CEO served in that capacity less than a year) do not exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The threshold
for individually disclosing CEO compensation information shall be adjusted in the following manner: Current year's
compensation disclosure threshold = Prior year's compensation disclosure threshold adjusted by the prior year's
annual average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. The 1994 calendar year shall serve as the base year
for making subsequent CPI adjustments to the $150,000 compensation disclosure threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Report the aggregate amount of compensation paid and the components of compensation paid during each of the last
3 completed fiscal years to all senior officers as a group, stating the number of officers in the group without naming

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Amounts shown as ``Salary'' (column (c)) and ``Bonus'' (column (d)) shall reflect the dollar value of salary and
bonus earned by the senior officer during the fiscal year. Amounts contributed during the fiscal year by the senior
officer pursuant to a plan established under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, or similar plan, shall be
included in the salary column or bonus column, as appropriate. If the amount of salary or bonus earned during the fiscal
year is not calculable by the time the report is prepared, the reporting institution shall provide its best estimate
of the compensation amount(s) and disclose that fact in a footnote to the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Amounts shown as ``deferred/perquisites'' (column (e)) shall reflect the dollar value of other annual compensation
not properly categorized as salary or bonus, including but not limited to:

(E) Compensation amounts reported under the category ``Other'' (column (f)) shall reflect the dollar value of all
other compensation not properly reportable in any other column. Items reported in this column shall be specifically
identified and described in a footnote to the table. Such compensation includes, but is not limited to:

Because this final rule governs matters of agency organization, management and personnel and makes no substantive
change in SBA's regulations, SBA is not required to determine if these changes constitute a major or significant rule
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, to determine if they have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), or to perform a Federalism assessment pursuant to Executive Order 12612. SBA certifies that these changes will
not impose a new recordkeeping or reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. CH 35).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SBA is publishing this regulation governing agency organization, procedure and practice as a final rule without

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series
airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect damage, corrosion, or cracking of the hinge pin on each shock
absorber on the main landing gear (MLG), and repair or replacement of the pins, if necessary. This amendment is prompted
by reports of rupture of certain hinge pins due to stress corrosion of the pins in the shock absorber on the MLG on Model
ATR72 series airplanes. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent loss of the MLG during a hard landing
due to malfunction of the shock absorber on the MLG.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes. The
DGAC advises that it has received reports of rupture of the upper hinge pins in the shock absorber on the main landing
gear (MLG) on Model ATR72 series airplanes. Investigation revealed that these hinge pins ruptured due to stress corrosion
inside the pin. Corrosion inside the hinge pins, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in malfunction
of the shock absorber on the MLG. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of the MLG during a hard landing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) has issued Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;32&hyph;1025, dated April 5, 1994. This
service bulletin references Messier-Bugatti Service Bulletin 631&hyph;32&hyph;099, dated April 12, 1994, for
additional service information. The Messier-Bugatti service bulletin describes procedures for repetitive visual
inspections (using a borescope) to detect damage to the protective treatments on the inside diameter of the hinge
pin on each shock absorber on the MLG. The service bulletin describes procedures for stripping any damaged protective
treatments to determine if the base metal is corroded, completing a paint scheme of the damaged area, and reinstalling
any pin on which no corrosion of the base metal is found. For pins on which the base metal is corroded, the service bulletin
describes procedures for removal of the corrosion and a dye penetrant or fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect
cracking of the pin; repair or replacement of any uncracked pin; and replacement of any cracked pin with a serviceable
pin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;065&hyph;020(B),
dated March 30, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent loss of the MLG during a hard landing. This
AD requires repetitive visual inspections (using a borescope) to detect damage to the protective treatments on the
inside diameter of the hinge pin on each shock absorber on the MLG. This AD also requires stripping any damaged protective
treatments to determine if the base metal is corroded. For pins on which the base metal is not corroded, this AD requires
completion of a paint scheme of the damaged area and reinstallation of the pin. For pins on which the base metal is corroded,
this AD requires removal of the corrosion and a dye penetrant or fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect cracking
of the pin; repair or replacement of any uncracked pin; and replacement of any cracked pin with a serviceable pin. The
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the Messier-Bugatti service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Messier-Bugatti advises that a modification of the link between the shock absorber and the universal joint is currently
under study. Therefore, this AD is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time
the FAA may consider further rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;95&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61598), FDA published a final rule amending the regulations in &sect;20.89 (21 CFR 20.89),
effective December 20, 1993, to provide that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) may designate
any other FDA officer or employee to act on the Commissioner's behalf to authorize the nonpublic disclosure, under
certain specified conditions, of confidential commercial information submitted to FDA or incorporated into agency-prepared
records. This amendment permits such disclosure to foreign government officials who perform counterpart functions
to FDA as part of cooperative law enforcement or regulatory efforts. The amendment also permits the disclosure of
trade secret information to visiting foreign scientists under certain limited conditions. Section 5.23 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure of official records
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 5.23) is being revised to add &sect;20.89(c) to the sections already referenced in &sect;5.23(a), and to list
those officials authorized to make such disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further redelegation of the authority delegated is not authorized. Authority delegated to a position by title may
be exercised by a person officially designated to serve in such position in an acting capacity or on a temporary basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19046), FDA announced that another food additive petition (FAP 8A4068) had been filed by Pfizer,
proposing to amend the same regulation for the safe use of polydextrose in fruit spreads. Then, in a notice published

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 15, 1989 (54 FR 10727), the agency announced that Pfizer had filed a third food additive petition (FAP 9A4126),
proposing to amend the same regulation for the safe use of polydextrose in sweet sauces, toppings, and syrups. In a
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54406), FDA announced that the agency was amending the filing notices for three food additive
petitions (FAP's 7A3998, 8A4068, and 9A4126) filed by Pfizer, dated January 26 and May 26, 1988, and March 15, 1989,
respectively, to state that the petitioner had requested that &sect;172.841 be amended to include, through incorporation
by reference, specifications of the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed. (1981), 2d supp. (1986), pp. 57 through 59, and
3d supp. (1992), p. 136.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has estimated that the proposed uses of polydextrose in peanut spread, fruit spreads, sweet sauces, toppings,
and syrups would add no more than 4.2 grams per person per day (g/p/d) to the mean and 4.6 g/p/d to the 90th percentile
estimated daily intake (EDI) for the 2- to 5-year age group and 3.2 g/p/d to the mean and 4.1 g/p/d to the 90th percentile
EDI for the 2+ years age group (all ages). Upon regulation, the cumulative EDI will be no greater than 16 g/p/d for mean
consumption and 26 g/p/d for consumption at the 90th percentile for the 2- to 5-year-old-age group and 18 g/p/d (mean)
and 29 g/p/d (90th percentile) for the ``all ages'' age group (Ref. 1).

II. Lead Specification for Polydextrose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has been attempting to reduce consumer exposure to lead in foods by revising or setting new lead specifications
for food additives. (See 59 FR 5363, February 4, 1994). During the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC) Committee workshop on
May 2, 1991, the agency presented its concerns regarding lead levels in food additives. The FCC Committee of the National
Academy of Science/Institute of Medicine thereafter revised its policy for establishing lead specifications for
food additives to require that lead specifications should be set at the lowest levels practicable on the basis of:
(1) Current good manufacturing practice; (2) potential hazard; (3) the availability of analytical methodology
for the determination of low lead levels in food matrices; and (4) estimates of food intake. Revised and new lead specifications
have recently been published for a number of food ingredients in the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed., 3d supp. (1992).
In amending the current regulation for polydextrose (21 CFR 172.841), the agency is incorporating by reference the
specifications for polydextrose set out in the ``Food Chemicals Codex ,'' 3d ed., 2d supp. (1986), as amended by the
3d supp. (1992), including the new lowered specifications for lead (0.5 parts per million (ppm)) as well as that for
heavy metals (as lead) (5 ppm).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency concludes that the available data provide reasonable certainty of no harm from the proposed food additive
uses. In reaching this conclusion, the agency has considered the potential for excessive consumption of polydextrose
to cause laxation effects in sensitive individuals. 21 CFR 172.841(d) currently requires that consumers be informed
of this potential through special labeling of products containing more than 15 g of polydextrose per serving. The
agency has considered the cumulative effect of the additional petitioned uses and has concluded that the current
labeling requirement is adequate to protect the public. Accordingly, the agency is amending &sect;172.841 of the
food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of polydextrose in peanut spread, fruit spreads, sweet sauces,
toppings, and syrups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petitions and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petitions are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.

IV. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment for each of the three petitions, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal
drug application (NADA) filed by Wildlife Laboratories, Inc. The NADA provides for the subcutaneous use of melatonin
implant in healthy male and female kit and adult female mink to accelerate the fur priming cycle.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Wildlife Laboratories, Inc., 1401 Duff Dr., suite 600, Fort Collins, CO 80524, filed NADA 140&hyph;846 which provides
for the subcutaneous use of melatonin implant in healthy male and female kit and adult female mink (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Mustela vison
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to accelerate the fur priming cycle. The drug product is an implant consisting of a silicone rubber elastomer that
contains 2.7 milligrams of homogeneously dispersed melatonin. The NADA is approved as of June 21, 1994, and the regulations
are amended in part 522 (21 CFR part 522) by adding new &sect;522.1350 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval
is discussed in the freedom of information summary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(i)), this approval
qualifies for 5 years of marketing exclusivity beginning June 21, 1994, because no active ingredient (including
any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary, and not required, because the rule is in the nature of a clarification
that reflects the Department's interpretation of existing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Justification for Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 10, 1994, the Department issued amendments to its regulations to implement sections 908 and 951 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (Act). That Act expanded
the coverage of RESPA to include mortgages secured by subordinate liens, and restated the Department's authority
over refinancing transactions. The Department's final rule of February 10, 1994, adopted certain definitions and
disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, to minimize
the burden on lenders and others in complying with different or conflicting definitions and disclosure requirements
for transactions also covered by the TILA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As published, the preamble and the final rule contained material that might have been misleading, so the Department
published a correction to clarify certain provisions in the rule (59 FR 14748). The Department has now determined
that two additional clarifications of the final rule would be helpful. Because the final rule has an effective date
of August 9, 1994, the Department is also making these technical amendments effective on August 9, 1994. A longer period
before effectiveness of these amendments would not benefit the public, and coinciding effective dates for the rule
and amendments may avoid unnecessary confusion about the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule is in the nature of a clarification that merely reflects the Department's interpretation
of existing requirements.

Because this rule clarifies a rule published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505), the finding of no significant impact
prepared for that rule remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with certain exceptions and additional requirements, a proposed amendment to the North Dakota
permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``North Dakota program'') under the Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists primarily of changes to provisions
of the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) and the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) concerning the Small Operator
Assistance Program (SOAP), the definition of ``road'' as referenced in the coal exploration performance standards,
and authorization for individual civil and criminal penalties under the coal exploration program. The amendment
is intended to revise the North Dakota program to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated April 21, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;01), North Dakota submitted a proposed
amendment (``Amendment XVIII'') to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. North Dakota proposed this amendment
in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR part 934.16 (l) and (y), published in the January 9, 1992, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 827). In addition, North Dakota proposed State-initiated changes to the requirements for preblasting surveys
and to NDCC chapter 38&hyph;14.1 reflecting 1992 changes to the Small Operator Assistance Program by the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) (Energy Policy Act) at sections 507 (c) and (h) of SMCRA. (For a document relating
to the regulatory provisions proposed by North Dakota for preblasting surveys and small operator assistance, see

 (58 FR 29155) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record
No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;7). The public comment period ended June 18, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for June 14,
1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to: (1) The proposed provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4),
regarding SOAP requirements for reimbursement of training costs and NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5), regarding
the prohibition of SOAP assistance to operations not subject to payment of AML fees; (2) the requirement for North
Dakota to revise its implementing rules at North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 to be consistent
with the proposed statutory revisions; and (3) the proposed revisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), regarding
the definition of ``road'' and NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08, regarding the authorization for individual civil and
criminal penalties under the coal exploration program. OSM notified North Dakota of these concerns by letter dated
November 12, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting additional explanatory information and a
revised amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;15). Specifically, North Dakota: (1) Stated, with
respect to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), SOAP requirements for reimbursement of training costs, that it will propose
the necessary statutory change in the next legislative session; (2) provided a statement of clarification regarding
North Dakota's intent with respect to its implementing rules for the revised SOAP statutory provisions; and (3) proposed
to revise its rules at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), regarding the definition of ``road'' and NDAC
43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, regarding the authorization for individual civil and criminal penalties under the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice dated January 9, 1992 (57 FR 807, 816&hyph;17), current NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) is similar to the Federal
counterpart provision at section 510(c) of SMCRA, but the Federal provision, unlike the State counterpart, does
not contain a temporal limitation upon the violations considered by the regulatory authority in making its decision
to approve or deny a permit. The three-year temporal limitation in current NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) renders
North Dakota's statutory provision less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota has now proposed to delete the three-year temporal limitation from NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5),
thus rendering it no less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA. The Director notes that North Dakota's reference
to SMCRA in revised NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) is interpreted to include SMCRA, its implementing rules, and all
state and federal programs enacted pursuant to SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See e.g.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds North Dakota's proposed statutory revision at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) to be no less stringent
than section 510(c) of SMCRA and is approving the proposed change.

2. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), Environmental Protection Performance Standards, Preblasting Survey Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) by requiring that a preblasting survey be conducted
by the permittee when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one mile [1.61 kilometers]
of any portion of the permitted area. Currently, the North Dakota statutory provision requires such a preblasting
survey when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile [804.67 meters]
of any portion of the permitted area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA requires that a preblasting survey be conducted when requested by the resident or
owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted area. North Dakota's
proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) thus allows a potentially larger group of residents or owners
within the vicinity of a mine to request a preblasting survey than is provided for by SMCRA. In accordance with section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental
controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed
under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land
use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for hich no Federal
counterpart exists Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed
to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed statutory
change at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), North Dakota proposed to increase the amount of probable
total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons [90,718.47 metric tons] to three
hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons]. North Dakota also proposed, in the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2),
that the costs of certain activities specified at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) (a) through (f) (discussed at findings
3 (b) through (g) below), which must be performed by a qualified public or private entity designated by the Commission,
may be assumed by the Commission upon the written request of an operator in connection with a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposed revision to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants
from one hundred thousand tons to three hundred thousand tons is consistent with and no less stringent than section
507(c)(1) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposal regarding the cost of certain activities that the Commission may assume upon written request
of an operator in connection with a permit application would appear to grant discretion to the regulatory authority
that is not granted in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. Section 507(c)(1) requires that the specified costs ``shall''
be assumed by the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This SMCRA provision is implemented in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9(a), which require the payment of such
costs for eligible applicants who request the assistance ``[t]o the extent possible with available funds.'' Similarly,
North Dakota's rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02 (introductory text) also require that the Commission
pay costs for qualified applicants who request the assistance ``[t]o the extent possible with available funds.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds North Dakota's proposed revisions to the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2),
when read in light of the regulatory limitations at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02, to be no less stringent than
section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements as set forth in the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 795.9(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the discussion above, the Director is approving the proposed changes to the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) to incorporate a portion of original NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)
allowing the commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the determination
of probable hydrologic consequences (PHC determination) required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(o) and to specify
that such costs include the engineering analyses and designs necessary for the PHC determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) is substantively similar to and is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(A)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) allowing the Commission's possible assumption,
for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the collection of cultural resource information required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(u),
any other archaeological and historical information required by the superintendent of the state historical board,
and the preparation of mitigation plans necessitated thereby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) is substantively similar to and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(D)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) allowing the Commission's possible assumption,
for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of preblast surveys required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e). In
addition to this proposal, and as explained in the discussion in Finding No. 2 above, OSM is approving North Dakota's
proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), which requires a preblasting survey to be conducted by
the permittee when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one mile [1.61 kilometers]
of any portion of the permitted area. Taken in conjunction with North Dakota's proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e),
proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) would allow North Dakota's SOAP program to pay for preblast surveys conducted
within one mile from the permit boundary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA authorizes payment for preblast surveys only in accordance with section 515(b)(15)(E)
of SMCRA. Section 515(b)(15)(E), in turn, requires the applicant or permittee to conduct a preblasting survey upon
request of a resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, taken together, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) and 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) effectively
allow the Commission to use SOAP funds to cover potentially more costly preblast surveys than would be required under
SMCRA. Since North Dakota has a preblast survey program requirement (1 mile) that is more stringent than SMCRA's preblast
survey program requirement (1/2 mile), small operators in North Dakota must meet the more stringent State standard.
Accordingly, the additional costs associated with North Dakota's requirements regarding preblasting surveys
may be paid for with SOAP funds. Finally, section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) provide that any State law or regulation
that provides for more stringent land use and environmental controls and regulations for surface coal mining and
reclamation operations than do SMCRA or the Federal regulations shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA.
Thus, based upon the discussion above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) is not
inconsistent with section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA and the Federal program and is approving it.

North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) allowing the Commission's possible assumption,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) is substantively similar to and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(F)
of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f).

Section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary ``shall'' provide or assume the cost of training coal operators
that meet the qualifications stated in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA concerning the preparation of permit applications
and compliance with the regulatory program. Moreover, section 507(c)(2) provides that the Secretary ``shall''
ensure that qualified coal operators are aware of the assistance available under section 507(c) of SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) appears to grand discretion to the State regulatory authority regarding
the provision of training assistance that is now allowed by section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. However, section 507(c)(2)
specifically references only ``the Secretary.'' OSM currently interprets ``the Secretary'' to mean the Secretary
of the Interior, and not State regulatory authorities. Therefore, North Dakota's proposed statutory language at
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) is acceptable and it is unnecessary for North Dakota to revise proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3)
to be substantively identical to section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. However, if North Dakota ultimately decides to adopt
the responsibility to provide or assume the training costs and inform qualified coal operators of the availability
of assistance under SOAP, NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3), because of its discretionary nature, will be less stringent
than section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. North Dakota will then be required to amend its program to mandate that the Commission
``shall'' provide or assume the costs of training and inform qualified coal operators of the availability of assistance
under SOAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, on the basis of the discussion above, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) is no less stringent than
section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. For the reasons discussed above, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3).

This North Dakota proposal is similar to section 507(h) of SMCRA with one exception. Since the North Dakota proposal
only refers to services provided under NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), it does not encompass any training assistance
that may have been provided under NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3). By comparison, the Federal provision at section
507(h) of SMCRA requires operators, under such circumstances, to reimburse the regulatory authority for the cost
of any training assistance provided by the regulatory authority, as well as for the cost of other services provided
or funded by the regulatory authority under the SOAP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota, in a letter dated December 3, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;15), acknowledged that
proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) does not require the reimbursement of training costs in accordance with
section 507(h) of SMCRA, and stated that it will propose the necessary statutory change in the next North Dakota legislative
session. Moreover, North Dakota stated that if proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) were approved, as submitted,
the State would not provide or assume the cost of training any small operator until such time as the statutory revisions
are made. As discussed in Finding No. 3(h) above, OSM currently interprets section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to require that
the Secretary of the Interior, and not the State regulatory authority, provide or assume the cost of training coal
operators and, in accordance with that interpretation, North Dakota is not obligated to do so. However, should North
Dakota decide to provide training as a result of revising proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) discussed above,
and use SOAP funds to do so in accordance with 30 CFR 795.5, the failure of proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(34)
to require the reimbursement of training costs to the Commission will be less stringent than the requirements of section
507(h) of SMCRA. Nevertheless, since North Dakota has stated that it will not provide or assume the cost of such training
until full reimbursement of the cost of all SOAP assistance is statutorily required, the Director finds that NDCC
38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), as proposed, is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA, and is approving it.

j. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5), Prohibition of SOAP Assistance to Operations Not Subject to Payment of Reclamation
Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed surface coal mining operation that will not be subject to payment of reclamation fees required by [SMCRA]
are not eligible for the assistance to small operators provided by [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (2) and (3)].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain mining operations in the State of North Dakota that are considered coal mining operations under
the State program and thus are regulated in the State pursuant to the North Dakota program, but which are not subject
to the payment of reclamation fees pursuant to section 402 of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the North Dakota program encompasses operations extracting coal incidental to the extraction of other
minerals where coal does not exceed 162/3 percent of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposes of commercial use
or sale (incidental coal mining operation). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 57 FR 37702, 37703&hyph;37704, (August 20, 1992). In contrast, the Federal definition of the term ``surface coal
mining operations'' at 701(28)(A) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 700.5 specifically excludes incidental coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, North Dakota regulates leonardite operations under its coal regulatory program. In contrast, OSM has
taken the position that leonardite is not ``coal'' as defined in 30 CFR 700.5, and thus leonardite operations are not
subject to regulation or oversight by OSM under SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 December 14, 1982, letter from OSM to the North Dakota Public Service Commission (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;17).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA provides for SOAP assistance to a qualified ``coal surface mining operator.'' Accordingly,
since incidental coal and leonardite operations are not considered ``surface coal mining operations'' under the
Federal program, such operations would not be regulated by OSM pursuant to SMCRA and thus would not qualify for SOAP
assistance under SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operators who will be deemed ineligible for SOAP assistance under the North Dakota proposal would not qualify
for such assistance under the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director finds that North Dakota's proposed statute
at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Director is approving it.

4. Coal Exploration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of clarification, the Director notes that in North Dakota, jurisdiction over surface coal mining and
reclamation operations, including the Small Operator Assistance Program, is with the North Dakota Public Service
Commission. However, jurisdiction over coal exploration, of which the following proposed revisions and findings
pertain to, is with the North Dakota Industrial Commission, through the office of the Geological Survey. Thus, the
surface coal mining and reclamation operation and coal exploration components of the North Dakota permanent program
are administered by separate agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), which defines the term ``road,'' as used in the
coal exploration portions of the North Dakota program, to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Road'' means a surface or right of way for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration. A road consists
of the entire area of the right of way, including the roadbed, shoulders, parking and side areas, approaches, structure,
ditches, and surface.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 defines ``road,'' in part, as ``[a] surface right-of-way for purposes of travel
by land vehicles used in surface coal mining and reclamation operations or coal exploration.'' In a letter dated November
12, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;14), OSM identified two concerns with North Dakota's proposed
definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, OSM stated that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in the first sentence of its proposed definition of ``road''
appeared to serve no useful purpose. Read literally, the proposed definition states that ``[r]oad means a surface
[for purposes of travel] *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a right-of-way for purposes of travel *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). OSM requested in its November 12, 1993,
letter that North Dakota either: (1) Correct what appeared to be an editorial error in a subsequent rulemaking; or
(2) clarify how the definition of ``road'' would be interpreted and applied.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded that during the course of coal exploration, roads may be
temporarily altered to leave established easements or rights-of-way and that the proposed definition of ``road''
at proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) includes those roads. North Dakota further stated that the ``surface''
used for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration are subject to regulation, whether those vehicles
are traveling within established rights-of-way or outside of them. Based upon the State's explanation, the Director
finds that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is not inconsistent with the
Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding the differences between the proposed definition
of ``road'' in the coal exploration portions of the State program and the already-approved definition of ``road''
in the surface coal mining and reclamation operations portions of the State program (NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;01&hyph;02(92)).
Specifically, the approved definition of ``road'' at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;01&hyph;02(92), like the Federal
counterpart definition, explicitly includes access and haulroads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained
for use in operations, including use by coal hauling vehicles to and from transfer, processing, or storage areas.
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), however, does not contain a similar list of various types of roads encompassed
by the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that the proposed definition of ``road''
at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) includes all rights-of-way used in coal exploration and was not intended to include
exhaustive examples of all types of roads. North Dakota also submitted a proposed revision to its coal exploration
regulations at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2). The revised regulation would include a new clause clarifying
that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A road is altered if it is constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way that causes the changes described
in this section.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulation defining ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 insofar as it concerns coal exploration, also includes ``[a]ccess
and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in *&blank;*&blank;* coal exploration
*&blank;*&blank;* .'' Thus, North Dakota's inclusion of the additional terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved,
and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), when read
in conjunction with the discussion above regarding the proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6),
effectively defines the term ``road'' to include all rights-of-way used in coal exploration as well as roads constructed,
reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way. The Director finds that North Dakota has clarified OSM's concerns
with respect to North Dakota's interpretation of its proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6)
to ensure that it is consistent with the interpretation of the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), defining the term
``road,'' and proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), that includes the additional clarifying terms
``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations, are in accordance
and consistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director is approving the
proposed changes and is removing the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 934.16(l).

North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) to grant the Industrial Commission (Commission)
the authority to require the furnishing of a reasonable bond amount sufficient to ensure the reclamation of roads
used in coal exploration. Specifically, North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) to provide
that the Commission, acting through the office of the state geologist, has the authority to require (italicized language

The Federal program does not require bonding for coal exploration. Thus, North Dakota's proposed revision specifically
referencing roads used in coal exploration with respect to the furnishing of a reasonable bond for reclamation goes
beyond the requirements of the Federal program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 739.11(b), the State regulatory authority
has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such provisions
shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed
revision to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a).

committed a violation, the proposed revisions did not indicate under what circumstances an individual director,
officer, or agent will be deemed to have committed a violation. In contrast, section 518(f) of SMCRA specifically
addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either
civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. Section 518(f) of

under this Act *&blank;*&blank;* any director, officer, or agent of such corporation who willfully and knowingly
authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or refusal shall be subject to the same civil penalties,
fines, and imprisonment that may be imposed upon a person under [sections 518(a) and (e) of SMCRA].

OSM stated that in order to be no less stringent than section 518(f) of SMCRA, North Dakota must revise proposed NDCC
38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to clearly subject corporate directors, officers, or agents, to individual civil and criminal
penalties in connection with violations committed by a corporate permittee, under the circumstances outlined in
section 518(f) of SMCRA.

By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting for OSM's approval the following proposed
regulatory amendment to NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever a corporate permittee violates NDCC 38&hyph;12.1 [statutory requirements addressing coal exploration]
or any permit condition or rule or other regulation implemented thereunder, a director, officer or agent of the corporate
permittee who knowingly causes such violation is subject to the criminal penalties imposed under NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(2).
``Knowingly'' is to be understood as defined by NDCC 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02. In addition, whenever a director, officer,
or agent of a corporate permittee willfully or negligently violates NDCC 38&hyph;12.1 or any permit condition or
rule or regulation implemented thereunder, civil penalties may be imposed under NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(1).
``Willfully'' and ``negligently'' are to be understood as defined by NDCC 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota's proposed regulatory change addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer
or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate
permittee. However, the proposed regulatory change does not address the circumstances under which a corporate director,
officer or agent may be individually subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
civil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. Accordingly, the Director is approving
proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to the extent that it specifically addresses the circumstances under
which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with
a violation committed by a corporate permittee. However, the Director is requiring North Dakota to further amend
NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to specifically address the circumstances under which a corporate director,
officer, or agent may be individually subject to civil penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate
permittee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, because North Dakota's proposed statutory revisions do not address when a corporate director, officer
or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed
by a corporate permittee, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 remains deficient. Therefore, the Director is not
approving NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to specifically
address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either
civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee.

2. Nature of Violations That Subject Individuals to Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the November 12, 1993, letter, OSM notified North Dakota that NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(1) would subject an individual
to civil penalties for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 violation and would subject individuals to criminal penalties for any violation committed ``knowingly.'' In contrast,
section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects a corporate director, officer, or agent to penalties only when that individual ``willfully
and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out'' the act or omission that constitutes the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM noted that because proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 would subject individuals to civil and criminal
penalties for a wider, more inclusive, range of actions or omissions than are covered by SMCRA 518(f), it would be more
stringent than SMCRA. However, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding these provisions and
reaffirm that these provisions did not conflict with other State law requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(1) above, by letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting
for OSM's approval proposed regulatory amendments to NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05. Those proposed regulatory
amendments provide for criminal penalties in connection with violations committed ``knowingly'' and civil penalties
in connection with violations committed either ``willfully'' or ``negligently.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota also attached a copy of the cross-referenced definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,''
and ``negligently'' at section 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 of the North Dakota Criminal Code. In accordance with that
provision, a person engages in conduct:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a. ``Intentionally'' if, when he engages in the conduct, it is his purpose to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. ``Knowingly'' if, when he engages in the conduct, he knows or has a firm belief, unaccompanied by substantial doubt,
that he is doing so, whether or not it is his purpose to do so.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
c. ``Recklessly'' if he engages in the conduct in conscious and unjustifiable disregard of a substantial likelihood
of the existence of the relevant facts or risks, such disregard involving a gross deviation from acceptable standards
of conduct, except that, as provided in section 12.1&hyph;04&hyph;02, awareness of the risk is not required where
its absence is due to self-induced intoxication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. ``Negligently'' if he engages in the conduct in unreasonable disregard of a substantial likelihood of the existence
of the relevant facts or risks, such disregard involving a gross deviation from acceptable standards of conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. ``Willfully'' if he engages in the conduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota stated that the above-described standards are more stringent than the Federal standard. North Dakota
also stated that it has been enforcing a similar standard in its environmental laws for a long time without any problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director has reviewed the State definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently''
in connection with the review of proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05. The Director notes that the proposed
State standards are substantively different from the Federal standards set forth at 30 CFR 846.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Federal standard is the same for both individual civil and criminal penalties, while the State proposes
two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the Federal rules, a corporate director,
officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties if that individual both ``knowingly''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``willfully'' authorized, ordered, or carried out the act or omission that constitutes the violation. In contrast,
the State has proposed two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the State proposal,
a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation
committed by the corporate permittee if the individual knowingly caused the violation. In comparison, under the
State proposal, a corporate director, officer, or agent is subject to individual civil penalties if that individual
commits a violation ``willfully'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``negligently.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although North Dakota and OSM use some of the same terms in describing their standards for the imposition of individual
civil and criminal penalties, the terms are not defined the same in the State program as they are in the Federal program.
For example, the Federal definition of the term ``knowingly'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Knowingly'' means that an individual knew or had reason to know in authorizing, ordering or carrying out an act or
omission on the part of a corporate permittee that such act or omission constituted a violation, failure or refusal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal definition of the term ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Willfully'' means that an individual acted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Either intentionally, voluntarily or consciously, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) With intentional disregard or plain indifference to legal requirements in authorizing, ordering or carrying
out a corporate permittee's action or omission that constituted a violation, failure or refusal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After conducting an independent review and analysis, the Director agrees with North Dakota that its proposed standards
for the imposition of individual civil and criminal penalties appear to be more stringent than the Federal standards.
Pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority
has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such provisions
shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director is approving North
Dakota's proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently'' and that portion
of North Dakota's Criminal Code at section 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 that contains those definitions, as incorporated
at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, as part of North Dakota's coal exploration program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, OSM, in the November 12, 1993, letter, notified North Dakota that, unlike section 518(f) of SMCRA, proposed
NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 does not explicitly include failure of refusal to comply with orders of the Commission
as cause to subject individuals to penalties. In addition, OSM noted that the North Dakota coal exploration program
does not explicitly address the issuance of orders by the Commission and that the program was approved by OSM on the
basis of North Dakota's agreement to issue each coal exploration permit with a specific condition subjecting it to
the requirements of 30 CFR 840, 842, 843, 845, and 43 CFR part 4 (see 45 FR 82214, 82226; December 15, 1980) Section 518(f)
of SMCRA subjects individuals to penalties when corporate permittees fail or refuse to comply with enforcement orders
or any order (with minor exceptions) incorporated in a final decision of the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the December 3, 1993, letter, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that its provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08
regarding liability and penalties for failure to comply with orders of the Industrial Commission should be clearer,
and expressed its willingness to approach the North Dakota Legislature in 1995 to request an amendment to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08
to include civil and criminal penalties for violations such orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees that North Dakota must amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08. Therefore, the Director is not approving
proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to require that, in addition
to violations, failure or refusal to comply with such orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the
North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties
upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program
at 30 CFR 934.16(y), as a result of a January 9, 1992, rulemaking action (57 FR 807, 823&hyph;24) will be modified to
reflect this decision.

Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with three exceptions, North Dakota's proposed amendment as
submitted on April 21, 1993, and revised on December 3, 1993. As discussed in: Finding No. 1, North Dakota's proposed
statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) regarding permit approval or denial standards; Finding No.
2, the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) regarding preblasting survey criteria;
Finding No. 3(a), the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) regarding the probable total
annual coal production and testing costs, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(b), newly-created
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) regarding probable hydrologic consequences and engineering designs, as they
apply to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(c), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b) regarding
the development of cross sections, maps, and plans, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(d),
newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c) regarding geologic drilling and a statement of the results of test
borings and core samplings, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(e), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d)
regarding cultural resource information, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(f), newly-created
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) regarding the payment of costs for preblasting surveys, as it applies to the North
Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(g), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) regarding fish and wildlife
habitat enhancement plans, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(h), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3)
regarding North Dakota's discretionary authority to provide or assume training costs for small operators; Finding
No. 3(i), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) regarding the requirements for small operator reimbursement
to North Dakota for the cost of permit application materials and training; Finding No. 3(j), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5)
regarding the prohibition of assistance to small operations not subject to payment of AML fees; Finding No. 4(a),
the proposed definition of ``road'' at newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), the clarifying terminology
proposed at revised NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), and removal of the required program amendment at
30 CFR 934.16(1); Finding No. 4(b), the proposed statutory revision to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) regarding
the Commission's authority to require a reasonable bond amount sufficient to ensure the reclamation of roads used
in coal exploration; Finding No. 4(c)(1), newly-proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, to the extent that
it specifically addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually
subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committee by a corporate permittee; and finally, as
discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(2), North Dakota's newly-proposed standards for civil and criminal penalties, which
use the proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently,'' as set forth in North
Dakota's Criminal Code at 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 and incorporated at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, as part
of North Dakota's coal exploration program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed in Finding Nos. 4 (c)(1) and (c)(3), the Director is not approving the proposed statutory revisions
to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to (1) specifically address the circumstances
under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties
in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee; and (2) require that, in addition to violations,
failure or refusal to comply with orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial
Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers,
directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y) will be
modified to reflect this decision. In addition, as discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(1), the Director is requiring North
Dakota to further amend NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to specifically address the circumstances under which
a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to civil penalties in connection with a violation
committed by a corporate permittee. Except as noted, the Director is approving these proposed rules with the provision
that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment
section at 30 CFR 934.16 that, within 60 days of the publishing of this notice, North Dakota would have to either submit
a proposed written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA
and 30 CFR Chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with North Dakota's established administrative
or legislative procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 934, which codify decisions concerning the North Dakota program, are being
amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program
amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without
undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
the oversight of the North Dakota program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by North Dakota of only such provisions.

VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the North Dakota permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to
as the ``North Dakota program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment consists of revisions to North Dakota's rules in the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) pertaining
to preblasting survey requirements and the State's small operator assistance program. The amendment is intended
to revise the North Dakota program to be consistent with and incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA
and the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the North Dakota program as administered
by the North Dakota Public Service Commission (Commission). General background information on the North Dakota
program, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and an explanation of the conditions of approval of the North
Dakota program can be found in the December 15, 1980,

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 22, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;01), North Dakota submitted a proposed
amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. North Dakota submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative.
North Dakota proposed revisions to its performance standards pertaining to the use of explosives and preblasting
survey requirements at NADC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17.02 (1) and (2). North Dakota also proposed revisions to its Small
Operator Assistance Program (SOAP) at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01, responsibilities of the Commission;
NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02, program services; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03, eligibility for
assistance; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04, filing for assistance; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05,
application approval and notice of denial; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06, data requirements; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07,
assistance funding; and NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08, applicant liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to North Dakota's pre-blast survey and SOAP rules are meant to implement statutory changes to
the State's regulatory program pertaining to the use of explosives and SOAP that were enacted by the State legislature
in 1993. (For a document relating to the statutory revisions proposed by North Dakota for preblasting surveys and
small operator assistance, see an additional final rule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for the State of North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota proposed the statutory and regulatory
amendments to its SOAP program in order to implement the changes to the Federal SOAP program at sections 507 (c) and
(h) of SMCRA made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 23, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 61857), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;08). The public comment period ended on December
23, 1993. Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17,
finds that the proposed North Dakota program amendment as submitted by North Dakota on October 22, 1993, is not inconsistent
with and is no less stringent than SMCRA. Thus, the Director approves the proposed amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each operator shall notify in writing, at least thirty days before blasting, all residents and owners of manmade
dwellings or structures located within one mile *&blank;*&blank;* of the permit area how to request a preblasting
survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On request to the commission by a resident or owner of a dwelling or structure located within one mile *&blank;*&blank;*
of any part of the permit area, the operator shall promptly conduct a preblasting survey of the dwelling or structure
and promptly submit a report of the survey to the commission and requestor. Any preblasting survey requested more
than ten days before blasting must be completed before blasting is initiated. Additions or renovations to a surveyed
structure must be surveyed upon request to the commission.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to increase from one-half mile [0.85 kilometers] to one mile [1.61 kilometers],
the distance from the permit area within which dwellings or structures must be situated before the owners or residents
of such dwellings and structures are entitled to the notice specified at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02(1)
and can require the operator to conduct a pre-blast survey in accordance with NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02(2).
North Dakota proposed these regulatory revisions in order to implement the statutory changes proposed by the State
in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993) pertaining to pre-blast surveys.
(For a discussion of the proposed statutory provisions, see the additional final rule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distance standard in the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and (b) regarding pre-blast surveys
is one-half mile of the permit area. North Dakota's proposed revisions at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02 (1)
and (2) would thus allow a potentially larger group of residents or owners within the vicinity of the mine to require
the operator to conduct a preblasting survey than is provided for by the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and
(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion
to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations
that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b)
dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
Therefore, the Director is approving the revisions proposed by North Dakota at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02
(1) and (2).

In this amendment, North Dakota proposed several changes to its rules pertaining to its SOAP program in order to implement
the statutory revisions the State proposed in a separate amendment. (For a discussion of the proposed statutory SOAP
provisions, see the additional final rule notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota
proposed these regulatory revisions in order to implement the statutory changes proposed by the State in ``Amendment
XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2) to provide that the Commission will develop
and maintain a list of ``qualified public or private entities'' as required by 30 CFR 795.10 and pay them for services
rendered. In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to substitute the phrase ``qualified public or private entities''
for the previous reference to ``qualified laboratories.'' North Dakota also proposed to change the term ``laboratory''
(or ``laboratories'') to ``public or private entity'' (or ``entities'') in its rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1),
69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06
(2) and (4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposed terminology change is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA which provides that
the activities to be performed under SOAP shall be performed by a ``qualified pubic or private laboratory or such other
public or private qualified entity designated by the regulatory authority.'' Therefore, the Director finds that
the proposed terminology change at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1),
69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06
(2) and (4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b) is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA or the
Federal regulations regarding SOAP at 30 CFR Part 795, as recently revised (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994), and the Director
is approving the proposed rules.

North Dakota proposed to expand its regulatory provisions governing SOAP program services at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1)
(a) and (b) in accordance with the statutory changes at North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (2)
through (5) proposed by the State in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21,
1993). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provisions, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published
elsewhere in this issue.) Specifically, North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1)
so that it will provide as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent possible with available funds, the commission will for qualified small operators who request assistance:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Select and pay a qualified public or private entity to perform the activities described under [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)]
including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of the mining and reclamation operations both on and off
the proposed permit area according to section 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The preparation of a statement of the results of test borings or core samplings according to section 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, as amended, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) will provide coverage of all program services
detailed in North Dakota's statute at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State proposal is substantively similar to its Federal counterpart regulations at 30 CFR 795.9 (a), (b), (b)(1)
and (b)(2), as revised on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28136), with one exception. While the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9
(b)(1) through (b)(6) specifically identify each activity that may be funded pursuant to SOAP, the State proposal
specifically identifies only two activities that may be funded by SOAP. However, as noted above, the State proposal
does encompass all activities described under proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2). The activities described
under proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), in turn, correspond to the activities described in the Federal program
at sections 507 (c)(1)(A) through (c)(1)(F) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 795.9 (b)(1) through (b)(6). (For a discussion of the
proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this
issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds that proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) are no less stringent
than SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the corresponding Federal regulations. Accordingly,
the Director approves the proposed rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise the introductory text of NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) by increasing the
amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons [90,718.47
metric tons] to three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons]. The proposed change would make NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2)
consistent with proposed statutory changes to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April
21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1), as well as the requirements of SMCRA at section 507(c)(1)
and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.6(2). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory
provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) Therefore, the Director
is approving proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) (introductory text).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) to provide that an applicant is eligible
for SOAP assistance if, among other things:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[The applicant] will be required to pay reclamation fees under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) is meant to implement the statutory provision of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5)
(see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1). (For a discussion
of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposed limitation of SOAP assistance to operators required to pay reclamation fees under SMCRA
does not render NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) inconsistent with SMCRA because section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA
only requires that SOAP assistance be made available to a qualified ``coal surface mining operator.'' As discussed
in the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue, the operators who will be deemed ineligible
for SOAP assistance under the North Dakota proposal would not qualify for such assistance under SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director notes that there is a typographical error in the SMCRA citation given in proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5).
That is, the reference to ``U.S.C. 1201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

'' North Dakota's Attorney General, in a legal opinion dated October 1, 1993, and included with this proposed amendment,
noted the typographical error, but stated that the reference to the United States Code at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5)
should read ``30 U.S.C. 120

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Director finds North Dakota's proposed rule at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) is not inconsistent
with SMCRA and the Director is approving it with the understanding that North Dakota will revise the aforementioned
typographical error so that the correct citation to SMCRA is referenced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The commission will determine the minimum data collection requirements for each applicant or group of applicants.
Data collection and analysis may proceed concurrently with the development of mining and reclamation plans. The
data requirements will be based on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The extent of currently available hydrologic, geologic, and other information described under [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)].

In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to expand the basis upon which the requirements will be based, as outlined
at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a). Specifically, as proposed, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a)
will now require that the data requirements be based upon all information described at proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2).
(For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere
in this issue.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) is consistent with the recently revised Federal regulation
at 30 CFR 795.9(b), which lists the specific technical services authorized for the SOAP and provides, among other
things, that ``[t]he program administrator shall determine the data needed for each applicant or group of applicants.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Director finds that NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) is consistent with and no less effective

North Dakota proposed to delete the portion of NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1) that prohibits the use of SOAP
funds to cover the costs of test boring or core sampling. The proposed revision is consistent with section 507(c)(1)(C)
of SMCRA and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.9(b)(2), which allow the use of SOAP
funds to cover the cost of geologic drilling and statement of results of test borings and core samplings required by
section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed revision at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(h) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 795.12(a) require, under specified circumstances, that a small operator reimburse
the regulatory authority for the cost of all SOAP services, which, in accordance with section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA,
includes the cost of training assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By comparison, North Dakota's proposed statutory change at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), proposed by the State
in ``Amendment XVIII'' did not include training costs as an obligation for reimbursement by the operator. (For a discussion
of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue).
Moreover, the proposed introductory text to NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08 only refers to ``services rendered
under [NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29]'' which do not include training assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed in the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue, section 507(c)(2)
of SMCRA specifically references only ``the Secretary.'' OSM currently interprets ``the Secretary'' to mean the
Secretary of the Interior, and not State regulatory authorities. Therefore, at the current time North Dakota is not
obligated to provide training under SOAP. Accordingly, North Dakota's proposed introductory text at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08
is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA and no less effective than the recently revised Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(2).

North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and (c) to require that the applicant
shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all SOAP services rendered under the NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if
the applicant submits false information, the applicant fails to submit a permit application within one year after
receiving the approved report from the qualified public or private entity, or the applicant fails to mine after obtaining
the permit. North Dakota's proposed revision of its rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and
(c) are substantively similar to and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the corresponding Federal

North Dakota also proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(d) to provide that the applicant shall
reimburse the Commission for the cost of all services provided under NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the Commission
finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual coal production for all locations exceeds three hundred thousand
tons during the 12 months immediately following the date the operator is issued a surface coal mining and reclamation
permit. North Dakota proposed this revision of its rule in order to implement the proposed statutory provisions of
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1).

Finally, North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) to provide that the applicant
shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all services provided under NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the applicant
sells, transfers, or assigns the permit to another person and the transferee's total actual and attributed production
exceeds the three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons] annual production limit during any consecutive
twelve-month period of the remaining permit term, and that the applicant and successor are jointly and severally
obligated to reimburse the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) is more stringent than the recently revised corresponding
Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(3). North Dakota's provision serves to impose reimbursement liability based
upon the annual production rates for the entire term of the permit, whereas the Federal regulation only takes into
account the production rate for the twelve months 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
immediately following
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the date on which the permit was originally issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds that NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) is more stringent than the Federal
regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(3). In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with
SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e).

5. Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the above discussion, the Director finds that North Dakota's proposed revisions at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)
(a) through (e) are not inconsistent with section 507(h) or SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.12(a) (1) through (3) and is approving the proposed rules.

h. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2), Small Operator Assistance_Applicant Liability_Good Faith Waiver
of Liability for Reimbursement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) to limit the circumstances under which the
Commission can waive the reimbursement obligation of an operator who receives SOAP assistance. Prior to this amendment,
NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) allowed the Commission to waive a SOAP applicant's obligation to reimburse
the Commission for assistance whenever it found that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. North Dakota now
proposes to limit the Commission's discretion by revising NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) so that it provides
as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The commission may waive the reimbursement obligation under the conditions described in [NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;08(1)
(b) and (c)] if it finds that the applicant at all times acted in good faith.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State regulations at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;08(1) (b) and (c) describe the following two situations that can
trigger an applicant's obligation for reimbursement of the cost of SOAP assistance:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The applicant fails to submit a permit application within one year after receiving the approved report from the
qualified public or private entity [performing SOAP services].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The applicant fails to mine after obtaining a permit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, under the State proposal, the commission may allow a ``good-faith waiver'' of a SOAP applicant's reimbursement
obligation only if the applicant's obligation was triggered by the situations described at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)
(b) or (c). No such good-faith waiver is allowed if the applicant's reimbursement obligation was triggered by something
other than those specified situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(b) allows the program administrator [regulatory authority] to waive the
reimbursement obligation if he or she finds that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. Since waiver of the
applicant's reimbursement obligation is a matter left within the discretion of the State regulatory authority under
the current Federal regulations, North Dakota's proposed change at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) is not
inconsistent with the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(b). Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed
rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, no
hearing was held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on North Dakota's proposed amendment from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various other Federal agencies
with an actual or potential interest in the North Dakota program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 10, 1993, the Bureau of Reclamation stated it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative
record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;04).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 16, 1993, the Soil Conservation Service stated it had no specific comments pertaining to
this amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;06).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 19, 1993, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that the amendment did
not conflict with any of MSHA's current regulations (30 CFR parts 0&hyph;199), and therefore, it had no comments concerning
the proposed changes (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;07).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By undated letter received November 29, 1993, the Bureau of Indian Affairs stated it had no objections to the proposed
amendment because it did not affect Indian lands (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;09).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 30, 1993, the Bureau of Mines stated it had no comments (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 1, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated it did not anticipate any significant impacts
to fish and wildlife resources as a result of the proposed amendment and, therefore, did not have any substantive comments
to offer (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect
to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under
the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that North Dakota proposed to make in its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. However,
OSM still requested EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;03).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 10, 1993, EPA responded that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. EPA also stated
it did not believe that there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the
Clean Water Act (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;05).

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by North Dakota on October
22, 1993. The Director approves the rules as proposed by North Dakota with the provision that they be promulgated in
identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. Approval of these rules by the Director
does not prevent OSM from requiring North Dakota to make additional revisions to its program pending the promulgation
of final Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 795 to implement the changes to SMCRA, as amended, regarding the SOAP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 934, codifying decisions concerning the North Dakota program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Science Foundation's nonprocurement regulations are contained in chapter VI of title 45 of the Code
of Federal Regulations. This volume is republished as of October 1 each year. This rule makes clerical corrections,
deletes unnecessary provisions, corrects nomenclature, reassigns internal responsibilities to reflect organizational
and nomenclature changes, and changes addresses to reflect the Foundation's relocation so the 1994 volume will be
correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only change of any substance is deletion of two parts_``Procedures and criteria for resolving questions involving
moral character or loyalty of applicants for and holders of National Science Foundation Fellowships'' (Part 610)
and ``Fellowship Review Panel'' (Part 630). These were adopted because prior to 1988 section 15(c) of the National
Science Foundation Act NSF to obtain a loyalty oath and statement as to criminal convictions from persons receiving
NSF Fellowships. Those requirements were repealed by section 105(b) of the National Science Foundation Authorization
Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 2865, 2868) and implementing regulations are no longer needed.

Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined, under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866, that this rule is not a significant regulatory
action requiring review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. I also certify, pursuant to the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;601&hyph;612, that none of the clerical corrections and
nomenclature and address changes made by this rule will have a significant economic impact on any small entities.
Finally, I have reviewed this rule in light of section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and certify for the National Science
Foundation that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b) of that order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a summary of the Commission's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

Summary of the Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By this action, the Commission denies a request by Kenwood Communications Corporation (Kenwood) for reconsideration
of portions of the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this proceeding. These rules were adopted in response to the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA),
Pub. L. 102&hyph;556, and generally prohibit the manufacture and importation of radio scanners capable of receiving
cellular telephone communications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in ET Docket No. 93&hyph;1, 58 FR 25574, April 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In its Petition for Reconsideration, Kenwood raises three issues. First, it argues that the deadlines for complying
with the rules adopted in this proceeding should be extended. Second, it requests that scanners sold to Military Affiliate
Radio Service (MARS) and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) licensees be exempt from the regulations adopted in this proceeding.
Finally, it argues that the definition of ``readily altered by the user'' that was adopted in this proceeding should
include only scanners that can be modified ``quickly'' by ``non-technical'' consumers. There were no comments filed
in response to the Kenwood petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Implementation dates. Kenwood contends that the April 26, 1993, cutoff date for equipment authorization and the
April 26, 1994, cutoff date for manufacture and importation of scanners that do not comply with the new rules do not
provide sufficient time to design and build new products to replace those being prohibited. This short period of time
is, however, mandated by the TDDRA and reflects the position of Congress that reception of cellular communications
by means of scanning receivers is a serious problem that must be resolved expeditiously. Accordingly, we are denying
Kenwood's request for an extension of the cutoff dates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Exemption for equipment sold to MARS and CAP licensees. Kenwood states that it manufactures two-way transceivers
that are generally set up to operate only on frequencies available within a particular radio service. Kenwood indicates
that some of its transceivers are routinely modified at its factory to operate on additional frequencies, such as
those used by MARS and CAP licensees, in order to accommodate the needs of its customers. Kenwood states that these
factory modifications can result, incidentally, in the ability to scan cellular telephone frequencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We see no reason why it is not possible to manufacture equipment to operate on MARS and CAP frequencies without resulting
in that equipment also having the capability to receive the cellular frequencies, since MARS and CAP frequencies
are far removed from the cellular frequencies. Consequently, we find that there is no technical justification for
exempting scanning equipment from the rules adopted in this proceeding based on its intended use by MARS or CAP licensees,
and we are denying Kenwood's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The definition of ``readily altered by the user.'' Kenwood requests that we modify the definition of ``readily
altered by the user'' to include only devices that can be quickly modified by ``non-technical consumers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. We believe that Kenwood's proposed definition would make it too easy to modify scanners. Most of the examples given
in our definition of scanners that can be ``readily altered by the user'' are modifications that perhaps could not
be done by ``non-technical consumers.'' Yet, they are examples of precisely the kind of easy modifications that we
believe the TDDRA was intended to prohibit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we are rejecting Kenwood's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In accordance with the above discussion and pursuant to the authority contained in Sections 4(i), 302 and 303 of
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications Act of 1934,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it is ordered that the Petition for Reconsideration filed by Kenwood Communications Corporation is denied.

petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of
the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be promptly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service also is required to commence a review of the status of the petitioned species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service announces a 90-day finding on a petition requesting the Service to list as endangered the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the ``western boreal toad'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bufo boreas boreas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and initiates a status review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A petition dated September 27, 1993, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Dr. Peter
Hovingh on September 30, 1993. The petition requested that the southern Rocky Mountain population of the ``western
boreal toad'' be listed as endangered and that critical habitat be designated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act allows the Service to list distinct population segments of vertebrate fish and wildlife. Physical and climatic
characteristics of the Great Divide Basin separate boreal toads in the southern Rocky Mountains (New Mexico, Colorado,
and southeastern Wyoming) from populations in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains of Utah to the west and the Wind River
and Salt River Ranges of Wyoming to the north. The Basin's hot, dry summers, lack of available water, and high desert
vegetation provide unsuitable habitat for the toad. Movement of toads between the southern Rocky Mountains and populations
in western Wyoming and eastern Utah is unlikely because of the great distance (>165 km (100 miles)) and harsh environment.
Because of this geographic isolation, possible genetic differentiation exists between toads in the southern Rocky
Mountains and the remainder of their range (Blair 1964, Hubbard 1972). Considering these factors, the Service believes
the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad is a distinct population segment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A status review was first initiated for the southern Rocky Mountain population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. b. boreas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by a notice of review published January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554). At that time the population was designated as a category
2 candidate, meaning that more information was needed before a decision could be made as to whether this population
should be listed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boreal toads were once common throughout much of the higher elevations in Colorado (Burger and Bragg 1946, Smith et
al. 1965, Hammerson 1989) and in the Snowy and Sierra Madre Ranges of southeastern Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1985).
Boreal toads were found at only three localities at the southern periphery of their range in the San Juan Mountains
of New Mexico; Lagunitas, Canjilon, and Trout Lakes (Campbell and Degenhardt 1971, Jones 1978, New Mexico Department
of Game and Fish 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Declines in isolated demes were first documented in New Mexico in the mid-1980's (Woodward and Mitchell 1985, Carey
1987) and in Colorado and southern Wyoming from 1986 through 1988 (Corn et al. 1989). Boreal toads are listed as endangered
by the State of New Mexico and are thought to be extirpated (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1988). Surveys conducted
in 1989 and 1993 revealed no populations at the three previously known San Juan Mountain locations in Rio Arriba County,
New Mexico (Charlie Painter, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, pers. comm., 1993). Carey (1993) also documented
the extirpation of 11 demes in the Elk and West Elk Mountains of west-central Colorado. Corn et al. (1989) found that
boreal toads were absent from 83 percent of locations in Colorado previously known to contain toads. Subsequent surveys
conducted by the Service and others in Colorado indicate that boreal toads continue to disappear from traditional
localities or are absent from locations that contain suitable habitat (Steve Corn, National Biological Survey,
unpubl. data, 1993; Hammerson 1989). No toad demes have been confirmed in Wyoming since 1987 (S. Corn, pers. comm.,
1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No single factor known to cause direct loss of boreal toads in the southern Rocky Mountain population appears to be
producing range-wide declines. Those factors that appear capable of affecting a population throughout all or most
of its range cannot currently be linked to the decline of the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad.
Low impact recreational activities such as hiking, camping, wildlife viewing, nonmotorized boating, and fishing
may occasionally disrupt breeding pairs or trample recently metamorphosed juveniles along shorelines (Campbell
1970). High impact resource management strategies such as timber and grazing may alter or cause the destruction of
boreal toad habitat. Other factors that may directly impact boreal toads are water retention projects, changes in
water availability, competition and predation by native and nonnative species, and fishery management activities.
State agencies have regulations to protect the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad from ``take,''
but these measures in general do nothing to protect the toad's habitat from degradation or to protect the toads from
other threats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factors that may cause indirect loss of toads include acid rain, pollution, and ultraviolet radiation. The potential
effects of acid rain, pollution, ultraviolet radiation, and natural population fluctuations remain unknown and
may be working synergistically with other environmental or anthropogenic factors to cause declines in toad populations.
Carey (1987, 1993) indicated that the proximate cause of the widespread decline of boreal toads in northern New Mexico
and west-central Colorado was a result of infection by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aeromonas hydrophila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bacteria (red-leg disease). However, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. hydrophila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is common in the microfauna carried by amphibians, and it does not cause infection or death in healthy individuals.
As a result, toads likely were stressed by other adverse environmental factors, such as those mentioned above, and
later succumbed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. hydrophila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 infection (Carey 1987).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described
in section 4(a)(1) of the Act. The five factors are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Diseases or predation;

D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the threats discussed above, the Service believes that factors A, C, D, and E may apply to the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the boreal toad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the threats
faced by this population. After reviewing the petition, references cited in the petition, and other available information
the Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the boreal toad as endangered may be warranted. Within 1 year from the date the petition was
received, a finding as to whether the petitioned action is warranted is required by Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also requested that critical habitat be designated. If the 12-month finding determines that the
petitioned action to list the boreal toad is warranted, then the designation of critical habitat would be addressed
in the subsequent proposed rule. At that time the Service also would determine if it is appropriate to propose to list
the population as endangered or threatened.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 With the restructuring of the Federal-aid highway program due to enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914), regulations for the administration and management
of activities undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds are updated to reflect the revised sources of, and
activities eligible for, such funds. In addition, the ISTEA allows the States more flexibility in managing and directing
federally funded research, development, and technology transfer (RD&amp;T) activities. This final rule includes
the ISTEA revisions and grants States this greater responsibility and flexibility for the management and oversight
of their RD&amp;T initiatives funded with FHWA planning and research funds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 21, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published by the FHWA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 67510) to obtain comments from interested persons on proposed revisions to regulations for program approval
and authorization; conduct; and reporting of planning, research, development, and technology transfer activities
undertaken by States and their subrecipients, including metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), with FHWA
planning and research funds. The proposed revisions were necessary to reflect changes to Title 23, United States
Code, Highways, that resulted from enactment of the ISTEA. In addition, the FHWA proposed that States establish a
process for management of RD&amp;T activities undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds that would enable
States to exercise greater authority over such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to administration of FHWA planning and research funded RD&amp;T activities, the final rule reflects
the FHWA's belief that its stewardship role should be one of concentrating more on the policies and procedures by which
States implement such activities than on project-specific approvals and oversight. This philosophy parallels
the administrative oversight procedures adopted for FHWA planning and research funded transportation planning
activities in earlier revisions to 23 CFR part 420, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A in 1985 and 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA instituted a number of substantive changes pertinent to transportation planning and RD&amp;T programs.
In addition to retitling it from Highway Planning and Research to State Planning and Research (SPR), the ISTEA: (1)
increased the set-aside of funds apportioned to States for SPR activities from 1.5 percent to 2 percent; (2) included
planning and RD&amp;T as eligible activities under the National Highway System (NHS) program and Surface Transportation
Program (STP); (3) permitted the use of certain funds made available under title 23, U.S.C., for intermodal transportation
planning and RD&amp;T; and (4) required the expenditure of 25 percent of a State's annual SPR funds for RD&amp;T activities,
unless the State certifies that it will use more than 75 percent for planning and the Secretary of Transportation (the
Secretary) accepts the certification. These legislative provisions are reflected in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirty-one sets of comments were submitted to the docket in response to the NPRM; 28 from State transportation departments/agencies,
1 from a regional planning agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 from a professional association, and 1 from a Federal agency. The overwhelming majority of comments were in support
of the proposed revisions and the increased flexibility for State management of RD&amp;T activities. However, there
were some concerns regarding some of the specific revisions and the short deadline for compliance. Many of these concerns
were due to misunderstandings about existing requirements and not the proposed revisions. A summary of the comments,
their disposition, and the changes made to the rule follow.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One State, in which most research is conducted for the State by higher education institutions, stated that the proposed
regulation does not pertain to universities as subrecipients and recommended citing Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' November, 19, 1993, for universities as
subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the State is the recipient of FHWA planning and research funds, Part 420 also applies to subawards to all categories
of subrecipients, including institutions of higher education. In accordance with standard OMB requirements, subawards
are to be administered in accordance with the procedures in the OMB Circular and corresponding agency implementing
regulations that apply to the type of agency receiving the subaward, whether or not specifically stated in the regulation.
To clarify what applies to administration of subawards to institutions of higher education, a new paragraph (o) has
been added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;420.121 as discussed under the section-by-section analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the term ``State highway agency'' be changed to ``State transportation agency'' to
maintain consistent nomenclature and reflect reality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since most of the State agencies to which Federal-aid highway program funds are apportioned are no longer single purpose
highway agencies, the FHWA agrees that use of the term ``State transportation agency'' is more appropriate and has
made this change. However, 23 U.S.C. 302 requires that a State desiring to avail itself of the provisions of title 23,
U.S.C., have a suitably equipped and organized State 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 department's indirect costs. Therefore, a definition of State transportation agency (STA) has been added to &sect;420.103,
as discussed below under the section-by-section analysis, to distinguish a State

 One State commented that it is using a significant portion of its SPR funds for training, ``since the ISTEA language
which was supposed to have covered training was inadvertently left out of that Legislation.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ISTEA in fact continued the funding provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(23 U.S.C. 321) for training of State personnel although at a reduced level of funding. With the exception of a specific
type of training cited in 23 U.S.C. 307(c), FHWA planning and research funds may only be used for transportation planning
or RD&amp;T related training if the cost of the training is necessary, reasonable, and it benefits the purposes of
the grant or subgrant. General training of employees who are not working on grant funded activities is not an allowable
cost. This is consistent with OMB cost principles which are applicable to FHWA planning and research fund grants and
subgrants.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One State questioned the estimate of 2,100 burden hours, shown under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act in the NPRM,
for the 50 States to comply with the regulation and stated that it will take much more time to develop a procedures manual;
procedures for tracking activities, schedules, accomplishment, and fiscal commitments; and procedures to determine
the effectiveness of the implementation process, and the utilizations of the RD&amp;T output. The commenter indicated
that the State has many of the elements in place, but did not know if the FHWA Division office would accept them or require
revisions in content or format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The estimate of 2,100 burden-hours (40 hours per respondent) is for the one-time preparation by each State, the District
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 required by subpart B of the regulation. Many of the other activities cited by the commenter are either required already
(e.g., progress reports) and are covered by the cited existing OMB clearances or are standard management practices
that the State should already have in place. An updated burden estimate has been prepared. It is estimated that the
average one-time burden for preparation of RD&amp;T management process documentation and certification statements
is 480 burden-hours (12 weeks x 40 hours per week) per State.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The authority citation has been amended from the NPRM to include 23 U.S.C. 303(g) which allows the use of NHS, STP, and
highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation (HBRR) funds for development and establishment of the management
and monitoring systems required under 23 U.S.C. 303. In addition, section 149(b) has been deleted since this regulation
does not apply to funds made available under this section of title 23, U.S.C.

Section 420.101&blank;Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section states the purpose of this regulation. It indicates that the provisions of this part apply to subrecipients
of States, including MPOs. Language has been added to indicate that it also applies to activities undertaken with
NHS, STP, and Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP) funds for development, establishment,
and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500. Use of NHS
and STP funds for such purposes was included in the NPRM definition of FHWA planning and research funds; the use of HBRRP
funds is being added to the definition as discussed below. A reference to the additional requirements for RD&amp;T
programs and studies in subpart B of this part is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 420.103&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes the terms defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and contains additional definitions for terms used in
this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``FHWA planning and research funds'' includes SPR funds, metropolitan planning (PL) funds, and the optional
use of NHS, STP, and Minimum Allocation (MA) funds for planning and RD&amp;T purposes. It also includes the use of NHS,
STP, and HBRRP funds for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems
required by 23 U.S.C. 303. The definition has been amended from the NPRM to include funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C.
144 for the HBRRP when such funds are used for development, establishment, and implementation of the bridge management
system required by 23 U.S.C. 303. This category was inadvertently not included in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this rulemaking does not change the definition of grant, one commenter believed that new readers may not
be familiar with the difference between a contract and a grant and, therefore, suggested that a definition of grant
be included to reduce confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA agrees and has added definitions of ``grant agreement'' and ``procurement contract.'' These mechanisms
for agencies to make awards to recipients are adaptations of definitions in Chapter 63, Using Procurement Contracts
and Grant and Cooperative Agreements, of title 31, CFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``grant agreement'' is defined as a legal instrument between an awarding agency and recipient where the principal
purpose is to provide funds to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``procurement contract'' is defined as a legal instrument between an awarding agency and recipient where the principal
purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the awarding
agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For administrative purposes, it is important to note that the purpose of the award determines whether the award is
a grant or a procurement action. The administrative procedures for grants are governed by OMB Circulars A&hyph;102
and A&hyph;110 and agency implementing regulations. The administrative procedures for procurement contracts
are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR Part 31) or State procedures if the recipient is a State.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since FHWA planning and research funds may be pooled for planning, as well as RD&amp;T, studies or activities of national
or regional significance, the definitions of national and regional pooled-fund studies have been moved from &sect;420.203
to &sect;420.103. In addition, both definitions have been modified to indicate: that MPOs, as well as States, may
contribute to pooled-fund studies; that national studies are usually administered by the FHWA headquarters office;
that regional studies are usually administered by an FHWA regional office in cooperation with a lead State or MPO;
and that the funds may be pooled with or without matching. While any of the categories of funds included in the definition
of ``FHWA planning and research funds'' may be pooled, the matching requirement can only be waived for SPR or PL funds.
Such waiver must be approved by FHWA headquarters for both national and regional studies in accordance with the provisions
of &sect;420.119(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed under the general comments and responses, a definition of State transportation agency has been added.
``State transportation agency (STA)'' is defined as the State highway department, transportation department,
or other State transportation agency to which Federal-aid highway funds are apportioned.

Section 420.105&blank;Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section continues the FHWA's previous policy of allowing States maximum possible flexibility in determining
which eligible activities may be undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds, as long as planning activities
of national significance, as identified in paragraph (b) of this section, are being adequately addressed. Under
the provisions of this section, the FHWA may withhold or withdraw authorization of FHWA planning and research funds
if planning activities of national significance are not being performed by a State. As discussed in the preamble to
the NPRM, this policy also applies to State subrecipients. Paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) in the NPRM have been rewritten
and consolidated for clarity into paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) in the rule without changing the substance of the policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern about the potential involvement in long range data reporting requirements that
would make unexpected demands on its manpower in order to provide data that support FHWA responsibilities as specified
in &sect;420.105(b). The commenter indicated that clarification was needed on this requirement. Another commenter
indicated that States should have the right to question the need for particular data requests from the FHWA if the cost
of providing such data becomes high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision has been in the regulation since 1986. The major data bases that are referenced in &sect;420.105(b)
are the FHWA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) and statistical reports provided by the States for inclusion
in the annual publication ``Highway Statistics.'' Both of these data collection activities have been approved by
the OMB and are resubmitted for approval every three years. Occasionally, information not included in these ongoing
data bases is needed due to special circumstances and enactment of legislation, such as, designation of a National
Highway System in accordance the provisions of the ISTEA. With each update of the HPMS and highway statistics reporting
requirements and with each special request, the FHWA will continue to make every effort possible to limit the burden
to the States while still receiving the information essential to guide the national transportation program.

Section 420.107&blank;SPR Minimum Research, Development, and Technology Transfer Expenditure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section reflects the requirement in 23 U.S.C. 307(c) that not less than 25 percent of a State's annual SPR funds
be expended for RD&amp;T activities unless the State certifies that it will expend more than 75 percent of such funds
for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135. It includes specific procedures and criteria for FHWA approval
of a State's certification that were in the FHWA Executive Director's June 25, 1992, memorandum to the FHWA Regional
Administrators. (This memorandum is available for review and copying in the file for FHWA docket number 93&hyph;18
at the address specified above under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) The certification must be submitted annually with the work program or with the request for authorization of funds
for the second year of a biennial work program. Except for rephrasing of the considerations in paragraphs (c)(1) to
(6) to change them from questions to statements, this section is unchanged from the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern over the criteria and procedures in &sect;420.107 for waiver of the requirement
for use of 25 percent of a State's annual apportionment of SPR funds. One commenter stated that the proposed rules go
far beyond what should be necessary to support such a certification and that it appears that the FHWA is unduly striving
to discourage this option. This commenter recommended that the requirements be reduced to an assurance that the State's
RD&amp;T needs are being adequately addressed. Similarly, other commenters stated that the requirements for submitting
an exception to the use of 25 percent of SPR fund for research are onerous and effectively prohibit exceptions as they
are currently written or that the proposed rule indicates that the FHWA will be reluctant to grant exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While 23 U.S.C. 307(c)(2) requires that a State certify to the Secretary that its total expenditures for transportation
planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135 for the fiscal year will exceed 75 percent, it also requires that the certification
be accepted by the Secretary. Based on the extensive provisions and emphasis on transportation RD&amp;T in the ISTEA,
the FHWA strongly believes that the Congress intended that the States have effective transportation RD&amp;T programs.
Therefore, the criteria for approving an exception are being retained.

Section 420.109&blank;Distribution of PL Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section reflects the requirements in 23 U.S.C. 104 that a State must make apportioned PL funds available to MPOs
and that the funds must be distributed by the State to MPOs in the State based on a formula, approved by the Secretary
(approval authority has been delegated to the FHWA), that considers population, status of planning, attainment
of national ambient air quality standards, and other factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution
of funds to carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable requirements of Federal law. The FHWA's
longstanding interpretation, that the legislative requirement that States make PL funds available to MPOs precludes
the use of such funds by the State for administration of PL grants or subgrants, is included in paragraph (a). It is FHWA
policy to consult with the appropriate Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regional office prior to approval of
a State's PL formula.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State commented that the requirement in paragraph (a) that ``the State shall not use any PL funds for grant or subgrant
administration'' is too restrictive and should be changed to permit a reasonable amount for administration. Another
State commented that under the ISTEA, a State DOT's role in administering and participating in MPO planning activities
funded with PL funds has increased significantly and that there should be a provision which permits the State DOT to
retain a certain percentage of PL funds for its costs in administering and participating in PL funded programs. Another
State commented: that the cost for grant administration historically has been included as part of the funding package
of the MPO planning work program; that this new provision may unfairly restrict the use of PL funds to only direct program
activity and not permit the State or MPO to use PL funds for organization administration costs; and that by not allowing
the use of PL funds for grant or subgrant administration, the FHWA will be placing an unfair economic burden on the various
parties concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These comments imply a misunderstanding of both the legislation and regulation. Before responding to these comments,
a distinction needs to be made between ``grant or subgrant administration'' and ``general planning process administrative
activities.'' ``Grant or subgrant administration'' includes activities such as processing or preparing PL grant
agreements between the FHWA and the State, subgrant agreements between the State and the MPOs, fiscal documents,
progress reports, and audits. ``General planning process administrative activities'' may include conducting
MPO meetings, preparation of planning work programs, and salaries of an MPO executive director and other administrative
support staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation has always specified that PL funds are to be made available 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to the MPOs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the State. The FHWA historically has interpreted this to mean that a State cannot unilaterally retain PL funds for
any purpose; all PL funds must be made available to the MPOs. If an individual MPO chooses to include activities (e.g.,
development of a long range plan, traffic counting) to be performed with its PL funds by the State for the MPO in its work
program, it may do so. If the required State PL fund distribution formula, developed in consultation with the MPOs,
allows for State retainage of PL funds, it may be approved by the FHWA if the retained funds will be used by the State for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
technical activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in support of metropolitan planning or for making discretionary subgrants to MPOs for special studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In no instance may PL funds (either in an MPO's work program or retained under an approved formula) be used by a State
for PL fund ``grant or subgrant administration'' as indicated in subparagraph (a). Such State grant or subgrant administrative
activities are eligible for SPR funding. ``General planning process administrative activities'' performed by
MPOs are eligible for PL funds. Such general administrative activities performed by a State for an MPO are eligible
for SPR funds and would be eligible for PL funds if included in the MPO's work program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One State commented that it would be concerned if the regulation is administratively construed to require a specific
formula for distribution, or require reconsideration of its policy on PL funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that funds be distributed by a State by a formula that considers specific factors has existed since
the enactment of the PL funding in 1973. The ISTEA added the additional factor of attainment of the national ambient
air quality standards. In developing the formula, the State must consult with the MPOs and must consider the legislatively
mandated factors, but all of the factors do not need to be included in the formula. In accordance with paragraph (f),
any formula that does not meet these requirements must be brought into conformance as soon as possible, but not later
than in time for distribution of PL funds apportioned to the State for the first Federal fiscal year beginning after
the effective date of the regulation.

This section includes requirements for State and subrecipient work programs that serve as the application for FHWA
planning and research funds. References to 23 CFR part 450 and subpart B of this part are cited for additional information
on metropolitan area unified planning work programs and RD&amp;T work programs, respectively. Except for correcting
citations to 23 CFR part 450 and changing the first word in paragraph (a) from ``expenditure'' to ``proposed use,''
this section is unchanged from the NPRM. The work program in essence is a statement of work that identifies the proposed
use of the funds; expenditure of the funds is documented in the financial and progress reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the requirement to submit work program documents creates duplicate paperwork for agencies.
The commenter stated that the same information is available in work plans for individual studies, and, if FHWA review
of individual study work plans is no longer required, submission of a work program is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A work program has always been required for both planning and RD&amp;T activities. The work program is the ``grant
application'' for FHWA planning and research funds and is necessary for the FHWA to determine if the proposed work
is eligible. A work program may consist of a listing of proposed studies and activities and other appropriate information,
such as cost of the activity and performing agency, with sufficient description for the FHWA to determine eligibility
of the work. ``Work plans'' that included details on need, purpose, approach, etc., for individual RD&amp;T studies
are no longer required. Therefore, there is no duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

which may be difficult to make on a biennial basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, the amount of FHWA planning and research funds available to a State is consistent from year to year over
the period covered by authorizing legislation (e.g., the ISTEA). In any case, if a State's or subrecipient's transportation
planning is a continuation of the same activities with minimal change in activities over an extended period, use of
a 2-year work program should result in a significant reduction in paperwork since draft and final work programs would
not need to be prepared and submitted for review and approval in the second year unless significant changes are necessary
in the description of work. The initial work program would describe the activities anticipated to be accomplished
over the 2-year period along with an estimate of funds for each year. The FHWA would approve the 2-year work program
and authorize the first year's work subject to availability of funds. Prior to the beginning of the second year, when
the actual amount of funds that will be available is known, the State would only need to submit a request to revise the
budget to reflect the actual funds available (and if necessary any significant amendments in the description of work
to be accomplished) for the second year and request the FHWA's authorization to proceed with the second year's work.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes general criteria and incorporates by reference other regulations and OMB Circulars for determining
eligibility of transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities and allowability of items of cost (e.g., salaries,
travel) within such activities that are proposed for FHWA planning and research funds. Administrative procedures
that must be followed for costs to be eligible for reimbursement are also included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that a list of examples of transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities that are eligible
for FHWA planning and research funds be included in the final rule. Appropriate sections of title 23, U.S.C., that
include information on broad categories of eligible activities are included by reference. The FHWA believes that
any attempt to provide a more specific listing could be misinterpreted since all eligible activities could not possibly
be listed. The longstanding practice of allowing the FHWA field offices to determine eligible activities, in consultation
with the headquarters office if necessary, has worked well in the past and will be continued. In addition, the FHWA
headquarters office will continue to issue appropriate guidance when necessary on the eligibility of specific types
of activities. For example, in response to several inquiries since enactment of the ISTEA, guidance has been provided
on the use of FHWA planning and research funds for transportation planning involving modes in addition to highway
or transit. As discussed in the preamble to the NPRM, transportation planning studies involving modes in addition
to highway or transit are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds when performed as part of the statewide or metropolitan
transportation planning processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to questions regarding eligibility of travel costs of team members conducting peer reviews of a State's
RD&amp;T management process, subpart B has been revised, as discussed below under the responses to comments on subpart
B, to specify that such travel costs are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds. While not required by this regulation
or 23 CFR part 450, similar peer reviews of statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes would also
be eligible if included in a State or MPO transportation planning work program and it is determined by the FHWA that
the costs are necessary, reasonable, and benefit the FHWA planning and research funded transportation planning
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of this section in the NPRM referenced the provisions of 23 CFR part 140, subpart G on the allowability
of indirect costs of STA planning and research units. The allowability of such costs for any STA unit that performs
work for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required under
23 U.S.C. 303 was addressed in a May 3, 1994, memorandum to the FHWA and FTA Regional Administrators. (This memorandum
is available for review and copying in the file for FHWA docket number 93&hyph;18 at the address specified above under
the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) To more clearly identify such allowable indirect costs, the reference to 23 CFR part 140, subpart G has been replaced
with the specific provisions and information provided in the May 3 memorandum. In accordance with longstanding FHWA
interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 302, except as specified in new paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;420.113, STA indirect costs
are not eligible for reimbursement with FHWA planning and research funds. Paragraph (b)(2) specifies that salaries,
but not other indirect costs, for services rendered by STA employees generally classified as administrative are
eligible for reimbursement for a transportation planning unit, RD&amp;T unit, or other unit performing eligible
work with FHWA planning and research funds (including development, establishment, and implementation of the management
and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500). Such STA administrative costs are allowable
in the ratio of time spent on the FHWA planning and research funded work in the unit to the total unit's working hours.
The FHWA is currently conducting a review of its longstanding policy on eligibility of STA indirect costs and, if necessary
based on the results of this review, the provisions in this section will be amended.

This section includes procedures for approval of work programs or projects, and amendments thereto, and authorization
for work to be performed with FHWA planning and research funds. The governmentwide common grant management provisions
for prior awarding agency approval of certain budget and programmatic changes are referenced at 49 CFR 18.30. While
executed project agreements are still necessary, the language in paragraph (c) was revised to eliminate reference
to forms PR&hyph;2 and PR&hyph;2A since these forms are currently being revised and the form numbers may change.

Several commenters believe that the requirement for prior FHWA approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified
in 49 CFR 18.30 is contrary to the intent of giving States more responsibility and authority. Some commenters also
recommended that, after receiving initial FHWA approval of the work programs, additional FHWA approval should only
be sought when a budget revision means additional Federal funds are required. One commenter suggested that FHWA approval
be sought only when a budget revision exceeds the limits of $10,000 and 15 percent of a research study cost as specified
in 23 CFR 511.3(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of these comments reflect a misunderstanding of the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30 which are governmentwide common
grant management provisions that have been applicable to FHWA planning and research funded work programs since revision
of OMB Circular A&hyph;102 in 1988 and issuance of 49 CFR part 18. These provisions were included in 23 CFR part 420 in
the 1990 update and are unchanged in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limit of $10,000 and 15 percent under 23 CFR 511.3(e), applies to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RD&amp;T studies; for example, a cost increase of greater than $15,000 for a $100,000 study would require prior approval.
Under the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30(c)(1)(ii), the State may make budget transfers among direct cost categories
(e.g., individual RD&amp;T studies) without FHWA prior approval unless the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
total 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of such transfers over the period of the work program will, or is expected to, exceed the larger of $100,000 or 10 percent
of the total approved (i.e., work program) budget. For example, if an RD&amp;T work program totals $2 million, the
State may transfer $200,000 among direct cost line items included in the work program without prior FHWA approval.
At the discretion of the FHWA, this prior approval requirement may be waived. Thus the use of the provisions of 49 CFR
18.30 provide more flexibility and authority to the State than the provisions that are being replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, a budget change that involves an increase in the total funds authorized for the work program still
requires prior FHWA approval and authorization. Similarly, the programmatic changes (e.g., adding a line item,
contracting out) specified in 49 CFR 18.30(d) require prior FHWA approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter interpreted the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to imply that the State can impose
obligation limitations on subrecipients of the PL funds and requested that it be clarified to indicate that such limits
can indeed be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of these paragraphs are not new and are not related to the issue of distribution of available obligation
authority within a State. These provisions allow work to proceed and be reimbursed at a later date in situations where
sufficient funds or obligation authority are not available at the time authorization is requested for all work in
a statewide or metropolitan area work program. Obligation authority is distributed to the States for use by the States
as determined in cooperation with the FHWA field offices. In general, neither legislation nor the FHWA specifies
categories of funds for which the States must use the obligation authority. States may choose to request authorization
of only a portion of the PL funds needed for a work program period, but would then need to ensure that additional funds
are requested and authorized prior to the MPO proceeding with the remainder of the work program. Such partial funding
necessitates processing of project amendments and additional paperwork. It also could result in an MPO performing
work that would be ineligible for reimbursement if the work is performed prior to approval of the amendment. Such partial
funding should be avoided if possible.

Section 420.117&blank;Program Monitoring and Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes grant monitoring and reporting requirements. The frequency and content of progress and financial
reports specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) are identical to those contained in the governmentwide common grant
management requirements and 49 CFR 18.40 which is referenced in paragraph (a). Paragraph (e) requires FHWA approval
prior to publication of reports that document the results of work performed with FHWA planning and research funds.
A State may request waiver of this prior approval requirement. The reference to the Federal-aid Project Agreement
(Form PR&hyph;2) in the first sentence of paragraph (e) has been deleted since Form PR&hyph;2 is being revised and
the contents of the cited provision for prior approval of reports are included in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believe that these reporting requirements are contrary to the concept of delegation of program
management responsibility to the State which should be allowed to determine how to monitor its research program;
FHWA review and approval should be limited to assurance that an adequate monitoring process is in place and is being
used to guide the State's program; and, if a State truly has responsibility for managing its own program, the State
should determine the needed frequency of reporting for adequately monitoring projects. Another commenter recommended
that an annual report should be adequate and that the reporting format should be kept simple. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These grant reporting requirements are not new and are standard governmentwide grant reporting requirements that
replaced more comprehensive requirements that were in 23 CFR part 420 prior to 1990. These reports are necessary for
the FHWA to perform its grant oversight responsibilities. Progress and financial reports that include the specified
information must be submitted at least annually. The FHWA field offices may require more frequent reports, but not
more than quarterly, unless the State is determined to be a high-risk grantee in accordance with the provisions of
49 CFR 18.12. The reporting requirements are for the work program (i.e., grant), not for individual ``projects/studies.''
The progress reports previously required in 23 CFR part 511 for individual research studies are no longer required.
Progress on individual studies would be addressed in the overall work program report. A State may establish additional
reporting procedures that meet its needs for individual studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, another commenter stated that &sect;420.117 requires an increased level of reporting activity and that
the interpretation and administration of this section could produce some very demanding requirements. This commenter
also questioned who would establish and approve performance goals, and what level of detail would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, this section is unchanged from the existing regulation and does not require increased reporting.
The level of reporting will only be greater for a State or subrecipient if the State or subrecipient was not in compliance
with the existing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the reporting provisions be flexible enough to allow monthly reports if agreed to
by the agency and the subrecipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, the FHWA may require more frequent reports, but may not require submission of reports more than
quarterly unless a recipient or subrecipient is determined to be a high risk. A State may establish the frequency of
progress and financial reports for its subgrantees, but is encouraged not to impose more burdensome requirements
than those imposed upon the State by the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the requirement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;420.117(c) that reports from subrecipients be submitted no more than 90 days after the end of the reporting
period does not allow sufficient time to complete the audit of the work program, especially when the MPO has elected
a 2-year cycle for the audit to be performed. It was suggested that the 90-day requirement be deleted and the timeframe
be determined by the State with approval of the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is confusing grant audit requirements with grant reporting requirements. In accordance with governmentwide
common grant management requirements, final progress and financial reports for a grant (i.e., the annual/biennial
work program) must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the grant period. If the later financial audit, which covers
the MPO's fiscal year and typically is not completed until a year after the end of the grant period, necessitates adjustments,
the grant may be reopened or adjustment may be made to a current grant, as appropriate. With regard to the statement
that an MPO has been operating under a 2-year cycle for financial audits, in accordance with the OMB Circular A&hyph;128,
Single Audits of State and Local Governments, audits must be performed annually unless a constitutional or statutory
requirement for less frequent audit was in effect by January 1, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the requirement that a State must request a waiver of prior approval of report publication
is an unnecessary and demeaning retention of FHWA authority; the State should have sole responsibility and authority
to publish reports that follow accepted editorial formatting for electronic data base management and retrieval
purposes; and the use of a report as evidence of work performed and approval for publication are two separate issues
and should not be combined. Another commenter stated that FHWA approval of reports prior to publication is inconsistent
with the intent of allowing States flexibility in managing their own programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to ``editorial formatting,'' the FHWA does not review reports for this purpose. The FHWA agrees that
the use of a report as evidence of work performed and approval for publication are two separate issues, but does not
agree that they should not be combined. This comment implies that the report should be submitted to the FHWA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
publication for acceptance as evidence of work performed. In addition to determining if the proposed work that was
approved as part of the grant was performed, the FHWA should have an opportunity to determine if the contents of the
report are supported by the work performed since the published report will include a credit reference to the FHWA.
Also, submission prior to publication allows a State to use FHWA expertise, if desired, to identify any necessary
technical corrections prior to publication and distribution. If, based on past performance, an FHWA field office
is satisfied that prior review is unnecessary and a State requests a waiver of the prior review requirement, the field
office may grant the waiver for all reports or for selected categories (e.g., State planning, MPO planning, all research,
or bridge research). A waiver may be granted for an indefinite period of time, annually, or any other appropriate period.
Whether or not a waiver is approved, appropriate reports that document work performed with FHWA planning and research
funds must be prepared, the reports must include a credit reference and disclaimer statement, and copies must be provided
to the FHWA as evidence of work performed.

Section 420.119&blank;Fiscal Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes fiscal requirements for administration, matching, and payment for FHWA planning and research
funds. Paragraph (c) specifies that the statewide and, if appropriate, metropolitan transportation improvement
program provisions of 23 CFR Part 450 need to be met for the use of NHS, STP, MA, or HBRRP funds for planning or RD&amp;T
purposes. Paragraph (d) includes provisions for waiver of matching requirements for SPR and PL funds (this option
is not applicable for optional use of STP, NHS, MA, or HBRRP funds for planning or RD&amp;T activities). If the FHWA
determines that the interests of the Federal-aid program would be best served without matching, it may waive the matching
requirement for individual activities or regional or national pooled-fund studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters stated that authority to approve 100 percent Federal funding should be delegated to the FHWA regional
offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approval authority for 100 percent Federal funding will remain with the Associate Administrator for Program
Development (for planning activities) and the Associate Administrator for Research and Development (for RD&amp;T
activities) since these offices are in the best position to determine whether the interests of the Federal-aid highway
program would be best served and whether the proposed work can be more effectively addressed if the matching requirement
is waived.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that limiting the cost to a minimum of $50,000 for cooperatively (pooled) funded projects
and requiring an agency's contribution to be at least $10,000 were inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to administrative costs and the time involved in coordinating pooled-fund studies, proposed national studies
costing less than $50,000 will not be accepted. In response to the comments, the minimum agency contribution of $10,000
has been deleted. Agencies contributing less than $10,000 to a national pooled-fund study may participate in the
technical committee meetings, but will not be reimbursed from the pooled funds for their expenses to attend the meetings.
At the discretion of the FHWA regional offices and participating agencies, regional pooled-fund studies of less
than $50,000 may be undertaken and travel costs may be reimbursed from the regional pooled funds for expenses for attendance
at technical committee meetings of representatives of agencies that contribute less than $10,000.

Section 420.121&blank;Other Requirements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains, mostly by cross reference, other legislative or regulatory requirements applicable to FHWA
planning and research fund grants. Except as noted below, this section is unchanged from the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to paragraph (d), one commenter stated that it appears that the regulation does not differ from present
procedures with respect to the acquisition of research equipment. It was suggested that more latitude be given to
the States for the purchase of research equipment with SPR funds when the equipment will clearly be devoted to research
at a facility largely supported by SPR funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with governmentwide grant management procedures and cost principles, equipment is eligible if the
cost is necessary, reasonable, and it benefits the grant. Individual items of equipment must be identified in the
grant application (i.e., the work program) and will be reviewed for eligibility on a case-by-case basis. In general,
if the equipment will be used only for FHWA funded work, all of the cost may be eligible. If the equipment will be used
for work funded by other sources, the cost should be shared on an equitable basis or through the establishment of rental/use
rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above under the heading General Comments and Responses, paragraph (o) has been added to this section. This
new paragraph specifies that subawards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations
will be administered by the State in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (58 FR 62992) and the
U.S. DOT's implementing regulations, 49 CFR part 19 (59 FR 15657). (Copies of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and 49 CFR part

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the State's responsibility to initiate a peer review of its RD&amp;T management process. An initial peer review
should be undertaken sometime during the first three years after the State's management process has been approved
by the FHWA Division Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The peer review is intended to review a State's management process, not the content of its RD&amp;T program. It will
not be used for compliance or certification. Peer reviews should help in identifying, reinforcing, and conveying
effective program approaches across the country and enable a nationwide sharing of successful practices and policies.
The purpose of providing the peer review report and a written response to the report findings to the FHWA Division Administrator
is primarily to keep the Division Administrator informed of the status of the State's program and what efforts are
being taken to improve the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The members of the peer review team will be selected by the State. The FHWA will establish criteria for team members
and will develop and maintain a list of qualified individuals who will be available to serve on the teams. At least two
members of the peer review team must be selected from this list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State may include a line item in its work program to pay for the peer review of its RD&amp;T program with FHWA planning
and research funds. The FHWA will consider establishing a national pooled-fund project if there is sufficient interest
from the States and if it would expedite the peer review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``periodic basis'' for conducting peer reviews has been determined by the FHWA to be once every three years. After
experience has been gained operating under the new procedures, consideration will be given to extending the time
period between reviews.

The option to submit individual studies for Federal approval (i.e., to continue operating under current procedures)
has not been included in the final rule. The regulations are mandatory for all States. The final regulation provides
a State with considerable latitude in developing and managing its RD&amp;T activities and supports the intent of
ISTEA to move the decisionmaking process to the State level.

One commenter stated that the FHWA's intent concerning the degree of RD&amp;T program interaction within State agencies
should be more clearly stated. Specifically, expectations regarding the degree of management involvement at various
organizational levels should be disclosed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the different organizational structures of the States, it is not possible to be specific concerning the degree
of management involvement. Each State should involve those management levels that are necessary to develop and implement
an RD&amp;T program that addresses high priority transportation issues.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the NPRM implies that the FHWA is going to require a uniform format for State work programs
since the information will be entered into a national data base.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no intent to require a uniform work program format. The FHWA will encourage the States to include summary sheets
listing all studies and costs followed by more detailed information on individual studies in their work programs.
Also, as part of its management process, each State is required to use the Transportation Research Board's Transportation
Research Information Services (TRIS) for reporting its active RD&amp;T activities. It will be the State's responsibility
to enter its new RD&amp;T activities into the TRIS data base. Since uniform entries will be required for the data base,
it could reasonably result in the States' work programs becoming more uniform to simplify data entry.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern about the requirement that each State implement a program of RD&amp;T activities
for planning, design, construction, and maintenance of highways, public transportation, and intermodal transportation
systems. The concerns were that the budgets for the smaller States are not sufficient to support activities in all
of these areas; the FHWA is requiring the States to set up separate groups of funding for highway, transit, and intermodal
research; and the term ``program of RD&amp;T activities'' is not defined.

allows
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the use of FHWA planning and research funds for RD&amp;T activities noted in &sect;420.207. The regulation reflects
the types of activities that may be conducted, but does not mandate that particular types be conducted. Each State
is to develop a program that addresses its highest priority transportation research needs. The priorities will vary
from State to State depending on such factors as the size of the State, its population, and the size and number of urban
areas. This regulation does not establish separate groups of funds for highway, transit, or intermodal research.

 Initially, for some States, it may require additional effort to document the State's RD&amp;T management process.
Once the management process has been documented and approved by the FHWA the amount of paperwork between the State
and the FHWA should be reduced substantially. Paperwork on individual RD&amp;T activities essentially will be eliminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Guidelines for implementing subpart B are being developed. These guidelines will expand on the requirements in &sect;420.207.
As a minimum, a State should develop a follow-up procedure to determine if the RD&amp;T results have been incorporated
into the State's standard plans, specifications, practices, or procedures. A more detailed process could involve
benefit/cost ratios or other effectiveness measures.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that to list individual studies in the work program reduced the State's ability to be responsive
to research needs as they arise during the year. According to the commenter this will cause a delay in the start of new
research by having to wait for the next program approval or for approval of an amended program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A listing of individual studies in the work program is necessary for the FHWA Division Office to determine if the items
are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds. Addition or deletion of individual studies is a programmatic change
that requires prior FHWA approval. Such prior approval may be waived by the FHWA division office; however, the total
FHWA planning and research funds authorized for the work program cannot be exceeded without FHWA prior authorization.
It is anticipated that once a State has demonstrated that it has an adequate RD&amp;T management process that meets
the requirements of this rule, the FHWA Division Office would consider a request for waiver of prior approval of programmatic
changes in the work program.

Section 420.205&blank;Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section explains the FHWA's intent to allow States maximum flexibility and discretion in managing and directing
their FHWA planning and research funded RD&amp;T activities while ensuring proper utilization of Federal funds
and avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for removal of paragraph (h), this section is unchanged from the NPRM. Paragraph (h) includes the nondiscrimination
provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and DOT and FHWA implementing regulations. Most of this paragraph
was redundant of &sect;420.121(m), which applies to RD&amp;T as well as planning programs. The citation to 23 CFR
part 200 that was in this paragraph has been moved to &sect;420.121(m).

Section 420.207&blank;Conditions for Grant Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section outlines the conditions that a State must meet for approval of FHWA planning and research funds for its
RD&amp;T activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) has been revised to indicate that a State's work program ``may'' include a line item for the costs associated
with a peer review of its RD&amp;T program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA will establish criteria and develop and maintain a list of qualified individuals who will be available to
serve on peer review teams. A requirement has been added to paragraph (b) providing that at least two members of the
peer review team must be selected from the FHWA list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last sentence in paragraph (c) has been rewritten to eliminate the impression that the peer review team is under
the direction of the FHWA.

Section 420.209&blank; RD&amp;T Work Program

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section outlines the items that must be included in a State's work program and incorporates by reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;420.115 for approval and authorization procedures. The title of this section has been changed from ``State
work program'' to ``RD&amp;T work program'' since it includes provisions applicable to the RD&amp;T program. A requirement
to include a summary, listing the major items and estimated cost, has been added to this section. The summary will provide
a quick overview of the content of a State's RD&amp;T program.

Section 420.211&blank;Eligibility of Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section indicates eligible costs for FHWA participation in RD&amp;T activities and references &sect;420.113
for other eligible costs. Paragraph (c) was revised to conform with &sect;420.113(b).

Section 420.213&blank;Certification Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides the format for a State's certification indicating (1) State compliance with the requirements
of this subpart; (2) the condition under which a new certification is required; and (3) the due date for the initial
certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that some States may not be able to comply with the proposed January 1, 1995, certification
date. The date for certification has been changed to June 30, 1995. In addition, a provision has been added that allows
the FHWA Division Administrator to grant conditional approval of a State's RD&amp;T management process for a State
unable to achieve full compliance by June 30, 1995. A conditional approval would cite those areas of the State's management
process that are deficient and that all deficiencies would need to be corrected by January 1, 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions were asked on how often a certification needs to be submitted and if a State could begin operating under the
new procedures prior to proposed date of January 1, 1995. The certification is a one-time submittal, unless a State
significantly changes its RD&amp;T management process. A copy of the State's certification is to be submitted with
its work program. A State may begin operating under these procedures as soon as its RD&amp;T management process is
approved by the FHWA.

Section 420.215&blank;Procedure for Withdrawal of Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section outlines the procedures used and penalties imposed if a State is not complying with the requirements
of this subpart or is not performing in accordance with its RD&amp;T management process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) in the NPRM proposed that, for any State not in compliance, the FHWA would withdraw the State's ability
to approve RD&amp;T activities and require the State to submit individual studies for FHWA approval. This approval
requirement is similar to current procedures and would have provided little incentive for a State to correct deficiencies
in its program. Therefore, paragraph (d) has been revised to indicate that an adverse decision shall result in the
immediate withdrawal of FHWA planning and research funding for the State's RD&amp;T activities until the State is
in full compliance.

Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive
Order 12866 or a significant regulation under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation.
This action amends requirements for administration of FHWA planning and research funds to be consistent with legislative
changes made by the ISTEA. Also, this rulemaking establishes a mandatory State certification process and a Federal
and peer review process to determine annually whether each State complies with the standards for State RD&amp;T management
in subpart B. The economic costs of this rulemaking will be insignificant and will consist only of the costs associated
with preparation of the grant applications and State development of procedures for RD&amp;T management. The cost
savings that will be realized by the States due to the reduction in time to initiate and conduct RD&amp;T activities
under the State RD&amp;T management provisions will more than offset the one-time cost of development of the procedures.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. This rule addresses the
administrative procedures and requirements that States must comply with when using FHWA planning and research funds
provided under title 23, U.S.C. This rule does not impose any direct requirement on small entities that would result
in increased economic costs. Based on this evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
Although this rule relates to requirements that States must meet to be eligible for FHWA planning and research funds,
federalism implications, though unavoidable, would be minimized. Nothing in this rule preempts any State law or
regulation. The rule provides States increased authority and flexibility to manage their federally assisted State
planning and research programs. This increase in authority and flexibility is in concert with the principles and
criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 for the implementation of express statutory provisions. Accordingly,
the FHWA certifies that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a full Federalism Assessment under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.

(a) Within the limitations of available funding and with the understanding that planning activities of national
significance, identified in paragraph (b) of this section, and the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134, 135, 303, and 307(c)
are being adequately addressed, the FHWA will allow STAs and their subrecipients: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Maximum possible flexibility in the use of FHWA planning and research funds to meet highway and multimodal transportation
planning and RD&amp;T needs at the national, State, and local levels while ensuring legal use of such funds and avoiding
unnecessary duplication of efforts; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To determine which eligible planning and RD&amp;T activities they desire to support with FHWA planning and research
funds and at what funding level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The STAs shall provide data that support the FHWA's responsibilities to the Congress and to the public. These data
include, but are not limited to, information required for: Preparing proposed legislation and reports to the Congress;
evaluating the extent, performance, condition, and use of the Nation's transportation systems; analyzing existing
and proposed Federal-aid funding methods and levels and the assignment of user cost responsibility; maintaining
a critical information base on fuel availability, use, and revenues generated; and calculating apportionment factors.

(a) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 307(c), not less than 25 percent of the SPR funds apportioned to a
State for a fiscal year shall be expended for RD&amp;T activities relating to highway, public transportation, and
intermodal transportation systems, unless the State certifies, and the FHWA accepts the State's certification,
that total expenditures by the State during the fiscal year for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135
will exceed 75 percent of the amount apportioned for the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Prior to submitting a request for an exception to the 25 percent requirement, the State shall ensure that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The additional planning activities are essential and there are no other reasonable options available for funding
these planning activities (including the use of National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, or Federal
Transit Administration Section 26(a)(2) funds or by deferment of lower priority planning activities); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The planning activities have a higher priority than RD&amp;T activities in overall needs of the State for a given
year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total level of effort by the State in RD&amp;T (using both Federal and State funds) is adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the State chooses to pursue an exception, the request, along with supporting justification, shall be sent to
the FHWA Division Administrator for action by the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research and Development. The
Associate Administrator's decision shall be based upon the following considerations:

Distribution of PL funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) States shall make all PL funds authorized by 23 U.S.C. 104(f) available to the MPOs in accordance with a formula
developed by the State, in consultation with the MPOs, and approved by the FHWA. The State shall not use any PL funds
for grant or subgrant administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In developing the formula for distributing PL funds, the State shall consider population, status of planning,
attainment of air quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other factors necessary to provide
for an appropriate distribution of funds to carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable requirements
of Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As soon as practicable after PL funds have been apportioned by the FHWA to the States, the STAs shall inform the MPOs
and the FHWA of the amounts allocated to each MPO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the STA, in a State receiving the minimum apportionment of PL funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(2),
determines that the share of funds to be allocated to any MPO results in the MPO receiving more funds than necessary
to carry out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(a), the STA may, after considering the views of the affected MPOs and with
the approval of the FHWA, use these funds to finance transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(n), any PL funds not needed for carrying out the metropolitan
planning provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134 may be made available by the MPOs to the State for funding statewide planning activities
under 23 U.S.C. 135, subject to approval by the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Any State PL fund distribution formula that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section
shall be brought into conformance with such requirements as soon as possible, but no later than in time for distribution
of PL funds apportioned to the State for the first Federal fiscal year beginning after August 22, 1994.

acceptable to the FHWA. Statewide, metropolitan, other transportation planning activities, and transportation
RD&amp;T activities may be administered as separate programs, paired in various combinations, or brought together
as a single work program. Similarly, these transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities may be authorized for
fiscal purposes as one combined Federal-aid project or as separate Federal-aid projects. The expenditure of PL funds
for transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas under &sect;420.109(d) may be included in the
work program for statewide transportation planning activities or in a separate work program submitted by the STA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Work program(s) that document transportation planning activities shall include a description of work to be accomplished
and cost estimates for each activity. Additional information on metropolitan planning area work programs is contained
in 23 CFR 450.314. Additional information on research, development, and technology transfer work program content

Eligibility of costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Costs will be eligible for FHWA participation provided that the costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Are for work performed for activities eligible under the section of title 23, U.S.C., applicable to the class of
funds used for the activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are verifiable from the STA's or the subrecipient's records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project objectives and meet the other
criteria for allowable costs in the applicable cost principles cited in 49 CFR 18.22; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are included in the approved budget, or amendment thereto; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Were not incurred prior to FHWA authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, indirect costs of an STA are not eligible for reimbursement
with FHWA planning and research funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Salaries for services rendered by STA employees who are generally classified as administrative are eligible
for reimbursement for a transportation planning unit, RD&amp;T unit, or other unit performing eligible work with
FHWA planning and research funds (including development, establishment, and implementation of the management
and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500) in the ratio of time spent on the participating
portion of work in the unit to the total unit's working hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indirect costs of MPOs and local governments are allowable if supported by a cost allocation plan and indirect
cost proposal approved in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87. An initial plan and proposal
must be submitted to the Federal cognizant or oversight agency for negotiation and approval prior to recovering any
indirect costs. The cost allocation plan and indirect cost proposal shall be updated annually and retained by the
MPO or local government, unless requested to be resubmitted by the Federal cognizant or oversight agency, for review
at the time of the audit required in accordance with 49 CFR Part 90. If the MPO or local government's indirect cost rate
varies significantly from the rate approved for the previous year, or if the MPO or local government changes its accounting
system and affects the previously approved indirect cost allocation plan and proposal or rate and its basis of application,
the indirect cost allocation plan and proposal shall be resubmitted for negotiation and approval. In either case,
a rate shall be negotiated and approved for billing purposes until a new plan and proposal are approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Indirect costs of other STA subrecipients, including other State agencies, are allowable if supported by a cost
allocation plan and indirect cost proposal prepared, submitted, and approved by the cognizant or oversight agency
in accordance with the OMB requirements applicable to the subrecipient.

Approval and authorization procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The STA and its subrecipients shall obtain work program approval and authorization to proceed prior to beginning
work on activities in the work program. Such approvals and authorizations should be based on final work program documents.
The STA and its subrecipients also shall obtain prior approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified in
49 CFR 18.30 and for those items of allowable costs which require prior approval in accordance with the applicable
cost principles specified in 49 CFR 18.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except for advance construction, authorization to proceed with the work program(s) in whole or in part shall be
deemed a contractual obligation of the Federal Government pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 106 and shall require that appropriate
funds be available for the full Federal share of the cost of work authorized. Those STAs that do not have sufficient
FHWA planning and research funds or obligation authority available to obligate the full Federal share of the entire
work program(s) may utilize the advance construction provisions of 23 U.S.C. 115(a) in accordance with the requirements
of 23 CFR Part 630, subpart G. The STAs that do not meet the advance construction provisions, or do not wish to utilize
them, may request authorization to proceed with that portion of the work program(s) for which FHWA planning and research
funds are available. In the latter case, authorization to proceed may be given for either selected work activities
or for a portion of the program period, but such authorization shall not constitute a commitment by the FHWA to fund
the remaining portion of the work program(s) should additional funds become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A project agreement shall be executed by the STA and FHWA Division Office for each statewide transportation planning,
metropolitan planning area transportation planning, or RD&amp;T work program, individual activity or study, or
any combination administered as a single Federal-aid project. The project agreement shall be executed after the
authorization has been given by the FHWA to proceed with the work in whole or in part. In the event that the project agreement
is executed for only part of the work program, the project agreement shall be amended when authorization is given to
proceed with additional work.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Additional information on reporting requirements for individual RD&amp;T studies is contained in subpart B
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The frequency of reports required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be annual unless more frequent reporting
is determined to be necessary by the FHWA; but in no case will reports be required more frequently than quarterly. These
reports are due 90 days after the end of the reporting period for annual and final reports and no later than 30 days after
the end of the reporting period for other reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Events that have significant impact on the work program(s) shall be reported as soon as they become known. The type
of events or conditions that require reporting include: problems, delays, or adverse conditions that will materially
affect the ability to attain program objectives. This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action
taken, or contemplated, and any Federal assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A provision of the Federal-Aid Project Agreement requires both the preparation of suitable reports to document
the results of activities performed with FHWA planning and research funds and FHWA approval prior to publishing such
reports. The STA may request a waiver of the requirement for prior approval. The FHWA's approval constitutes acceptance
of such reports as evidence of work performed but does not imply endorsement of a report's findings or recommendations.
Reports prepared for FHWA funded work shall include appropriate credit references and disclaimer statements.

Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission adopts rules governing competitive bidding to award initial licenses in the Personal Communications
Services in the 2 GHz band (broadband PCS''). This action is taken to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended. The new rules will promote the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products,
and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas. These rules also will promote
economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small
businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. This action
will result in recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum made available for commercial
use.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopt rules to conduct auctions for the award of more than 2,000 licenses to provide personal communications services
in the 2 GHz band, which we call ``broadband PCS.'' These broadband PCS auctions will constitute the largest auction
of public assets in American history and are expected to recover billions of dollars for the United States Treasury.
More importantly, the auctions will lead to the introduction of an array of new telecommunications products and services
that are expected to fuel our nation's economic growth and revolutionize the way in which Americans communicate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We also adopt in this Order provisions to fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that small businesses, rural
telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women are given the opportunity to participate in the
provision of broadband PCS. These rules will provide unprecedented opportunities for these designated entities
to become meaningfully involved in the provision of a new telecommunications service. This action seeks to ensure
that licenses for broadband PCS are disseminated to a wide variety of applicants and to remedy the serious underrepresentation
of minorities and women in the provision of telecommunications services. Further, by the actions we take today we
seek to ensure that PCS is provided to all communities in this country, including rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Broadband PCS will provide a variety of mobile services that will compete with existing cellular services. In addition,
broadband PCS is expected to provide new mobile communications capabilities that are not currently available. These
services will be provided by means of a new generation of communications devices that will include small, lightweight,
multi-function portable phones, portable facsimile and other imaging devices, new types of multi-channel cordless
phones, and advanced paging devices with two-way data capabilities.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The introduction of broadband PCS should benefit consumers by raising the overall level of competition in many already
competitive segments of the telecommunications industry and by providing competition in other segments for the
first time. The broadband PCS industry should also generate thousands of jobs in this country and improve the international
competitiveness of the American economy.

We already have adopted rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded to provide personal communications
services in the 900 MHz band (narrowband PCS), which will be used primarily to provide advanced paging services, and
for licenses to provide Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS), which will be used to provide services such as home
shopping and pay-per-view programming.

4. Auctions for broadband PCS licenses will be conducted pursuant to Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 47
U.S.C. &sect;309(j), which was enacted in August 1993. Section 309(j) granted the Commission express authority
to employ competitive bidding procedures to award licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Section 309(j)(1) permits auctions only where mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses are accepted
for filing by the Commission and where the principal use of the spectrum is reasonably likely to involve the receipt
by the licensee of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit
communications signals. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in his proceeding, we concluded that PCS as a class of service satisfies the Section 309(j)(1) criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), at &para;&para;54&hyph;58. Accordingly, if mutually exclusive applications for a broadband PCS license are
accepted for filing, we will award that license through competitive bidding.

We adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to implement Section 309(j) on September 23, 1993. Notice of Proposed Rule
Making in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 8 FCC Rcd 7635, 58 FR 53489, Oct. 15, 1993 (hereinafter ``NPRM'' or ``Notice'').
The Commission received 222 comments, 169 reply comments and numerous

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that we could design auction procedures to govern the award of broadband PCS licenses that would promote the objectives
listed in Section 309(j)(3). More specifically, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we determined that the use of competitive bidding to award broadband PCS licenses, as compared with other licensing
methods, would speed the development and deployment of new services to the public and would encourage efficient use
of the spectrum, as required by Section 309(j)(3) (A) and (D). In this regard, we noted that auctions would generally
award licenses quickly to those parties who value them most highly and who are therefore most likely to introduce service
rapidly to the public. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. at &para;57. We also concluded that competitive bidding would recover for the public a portion of the value of the
spectrum, as envisioned in Section 309(j)(3)(C). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We considered a variety of methods to implement Congress's remaining objectives, set forth in Section 309(j)(3)(B),
of ``promoting economic opportunity'' and ``avoiding excessive concentration of licenses'' by disseminating
licenses ``among a wide variety of applicants.'' In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted rules which provide the Commission with a menu of options to choose from to promote these objectives with
respect to particular spectrum services to be auctioned, such as broadband PCS, in service-specific rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we established bandwidth assignments and area designations for broadband PCS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, FCC 93&hyph;451, 8 FCC Rcd 7700, 58 FR 59174, Nov. 8, 1993. In that Order, we allocated
120 MHz of spectrum for licensed broadband PCS. We divided the licensed broadband PCS spectrum into three 30 MHz blocks
(blocks A, B and C) and three 10 MHz blocks (blocks D, E and F). We also designated two different service areas: 493 Basic
Trading Areas (``BTAs'') and 51 Major Trading Areas (``MTAs'').
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The licenses in frequency blocks A and B will be awarded on an MTA basis, and the licenses on frequency blocks C, D, E and
F will be awarded on a BTA basis. A total of 2,074 broadband PCS licenses will therefore be issued.

See Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para;102&hyph;132, 147&hyph;158. By these rules, we intend to promote competition in the wireless telecommunications
market by as many different qualified providers as the spectrum can reasonably accommodate and to promote the rapid
deployment of the infrastructure required to provide broadband PCS.

II. Executive Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. In this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we set forth the specific auction procedures for broadband PCS licenses. We have decided to conduct three auctions:
the first for the 99 available PCS licenses in MTA blocks A and B, the second for the 986 PCS licenses in BTA blocks C and
F, and the third for the remaining 986 PCS licenses in BTA blocks D and E. That is, the first auction will award licenses
for the 30 MHz blocks for large geographic areas. The second auction will award licenses for smaller geographic areas
for the two blocks that, as explained below, we have reserved for bidding by relatively small companies. In these ``entrepreneurs'
blocks,'' we have designed procedures to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses
owned by women and minorities, which we collectively refer to as designated entities, have ``the opportunity to participate
in the provision'' of PCS, as Congress directed in Section 309(j)(4)(D). In the third auction we will award licenses
for the remaining 10 MHz blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. We intend to conduct each auction through simultaneous multiple round bidding with simultaneous stopping rules.
Under that approach, no license awarded until the bidding closes on all licenses in the auction. We have determined
that simultaneous multiple round bidding is appropriate where the value of the licenses is high compared to the cost
of conducting the auction and the values of licenses are interdependent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;106&hyph;111. We believe the former condition is met here because other government agencies project that
the boardband PMS licenses will be auctioned for as much as $10.6 billion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;177. The latter condition is also satisfied because the record demonstrates, for example, that a license
for the Philadelphia MTA or the Richmond MTA will likely be valued more highly if it is held in conjunction with the license
for the Washington-Baltimore MTA. We are adopting a variety of rules governing bid increments and bidding activity
to move the auctions toward completion in a reasonable period of time. We are also retaining the ability to use other
approaches, including sequential auctions for the licenses, and to make other adjustments to the auction process
as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. As mentioned above, we establish by this Order a number of rules to implement Congress's mandate in Section 309(j)(4)(D)
that we ensure that designated entities are ``given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services'' such as broadband PCS. To accomplish this objective, Congress directed us to ``consider the use of tax
certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(D). We construe this congressional
directive as a mandate that we take the steps that are necessary to ensure that designated entities have a realistic
opportunity to obtain broadband PCS licenses. We apply that mandate in light of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 497 U.S. 547, 564&hyph;565 (1990), which held that ``benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress *&blank;*&blank;*
are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power
of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'' The rules we adopt also further Congress's
objectives, set forth in Section 309(j)(3)(B), of ``promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring
that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small business, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' Each of the steps adopted here is directly
related to carrying out Congress's stated objective of promoting economic opportunity by disseminating broadband
PCS licenses to a wide variety of applicants, including designated entities.

10. The record clearly demonstrates that the primary impediment to participation by designated entities is lack
of access to capital. This impediment arises for small businesses from the higher costs they face in raising capital
and for businesses owned by minorities and women from lending discrimination as well. In this regard, it should be
noted that although auctions have many beneficial aspects, they threaten to erect another barrier to participation
by small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women by raising the cost of entry into spectrum-based
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Congress has recognized that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial
markets than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Congress further found that women and minorities face particularly severe problems in raising capital.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 A study of mortgage lending conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1992 illustrates how problems arise.
That study showed that in cases in which lenders exercised discretion in deciding whether to make a loan to a borrower
who presented some problems (which includes most mortgage applicants), that discretion tended to be exercised in
favor of whites. As a result, a minority applicant for a mortgage who was identical in all pertinent respects to a white
applicant nevertheless was 60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 At the same time, discrimination was difficult to show in any particular case, although it emerged clearly when data
concerning hundreds of mortgage applications were reviewed.

12. The first measure we adopt to fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in providing broadband PCS is to reserve the 30 MHz licenses on block C and the 10 MHz licenses on block
F, both of which are to be licensed in each of the 493 BTAs, for bidding by entities with annual gross revenues of less
than $125 million and total assets of less than $500 million. These limits will exclude many large telecommunications
companies from bidding on these two blocks. We will not allow one entity to obtain more than 10 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 98) of the licenses on these two blocks. By excluding large companies from bidding in these two blocks and by limiting
the total number of licenses that one entity can obtain in these blocks we create numerous opportunities for small
entities to become PCS providers and thereby ensure that broadband PMS licenses will be disseminated ``among a wide
variety of applicants,'' as required by Section 309(j)(3)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Reserving blocks C and F for bidding by relatively small companies will not, by itself, be sufficient to ensure
that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have the opportunity to obtain
broadband PCS licenses. Under the definition we apply or purposes of this Order, ``small businesses'' are those with
gross revenues not exceeding $40 million, and those businesses will be at a disadvantage in competing against companies
with gross revenues of as much as $125 million. In addition, businesses owned by members of minority groups and women
face discrimination that poses additional obstacles for these firms. Accordingly, we take five related steps within
the entrepreneurs' blocks to assist designated entities in attracting the capital necessary to obtain a broadband
PCS license.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. First, we will structure our attribution rules to allow those extremely large companies that may not bid on blocks
C and F to invest in entities that bid on those blocks. More specifically, we will allow the relatively small companies
eligible to bid in these blocks to obtain investment representing up to 75 percent of their passive equity from larger
companies so long as each investor holds no more than a 25 percent passive equity interest. In addition, eligible businesses
owned by minorities and women may choose to have a single investor, no matter how large, hold a passive equity interest
up to 49.9 percent. These rules, and others that we establish in this Order, are designed to enhance access to capital
by businesses owned by minorities and women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Second, to encourage large companies to invest in designated entities and to assist designated entities without
large investors to overcome the additional hurdle presented by auctions, we will make bidding credits available
to designated entities. More specifically, small businesses will receive a 10 percent bidding credit (or a 10 percent
discount on their winning bids). Businesses owned by minorities and women will receive a 15 percent bidding credit
to compensate for the substantial problems they face in attracting capital. The credits will be cumulative, so that
a business owned by minorities or women that also qualifies as a small business will receive a 25 percent bidding credit.
Under these rules, it still will be more expensive for designated entities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services than it was before Congress granted us authority to hold auctions, because they will have to purchase licenses.
But by adopting bidding credits, which are explicitly authorized by Section 309(j)(4)(D), the Commission seeks
to promote economic opportunity and to counterbalance the tendency of auctions to concentrate license ownership
in the hands of several very large companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Third, we will allow most successful bidders within the entrepreneurs' blocks to pay for their licenses in installments
for generally the same reasons_encouraging large companies to invest in designated entities, promoting economic
opportunity by assisting designated entities in overcoming the additional hurdle presented by auctions, and ensuring
that licenses are disseminated widely. In general, successful bidders will be permitted to defer payments of principal
on their debt to the government for some period. Small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women will
be permitted to defer payments of principal for a longer period than other successful bidders in these blocks. Finally,
businesses owned by minorities and women will be charged a lower interest rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Fourth, we will extend our tax certificate policies to promote participation by minorities and women in the provision
of broadband PCS. The holder of a tax certificate is permitted to defer payment of the capital gains tax that would otherwise
be recognized upon the sale of an investment. Our extension of the tax certificate policy to broadband PCS will promote
involvement by minorities and women in spectrum-based services in three ways. First, initial investors in such businesses
will be eligible for tax certificates upon the sale of their investments. We expect that the availability of such favorable
tax treatment will enable minority- and women-owned businesses to attract investors more easily. Second, holders
of broadband PCS licenses will be able to obtain tax certificates upon the sale of the business to a company controlled
by minorities and women. Third, a cellular operator that sells its interest in an overlapping cellular system to a
minority- or woman-owned business to come into compliance with our PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule will be eligible
for a tax certificate. Both the second and third policy will further Congress' objective of ensuring that spectrum
licenses are disseminated widely and, in particular, to designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Finally, we will reduce the upfront payment for all bidders in the entrepreneurs' block. Bidders in the other blocks
will pay $0.02 per MHz per pop while winners in the entrepreneurs' blocks will receive a 25 percent discount and pay
only $0.015 per MHz per pop as a pre-auction payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Congress was also concerned that rural areas not go unserved by PCS, and therefore directed us to ensure participation
in auctions for spectrum-based services by rural telephone companies who have a history of service to rural areas
and an established infrastructure on which to build a PCS business effectively. Thus, we establish partitioning
rules in this Order that will allow them to use their existing wireline network to efficiently and expeditiously provide
PCS in rural areas. In addition, most rural telephone companies will qualify to bid on the entrepreneurs' blocks,
and hence will be eligible for installment payments. Those rural telephone companies that qualify as small or minority-
or women-owned businesses will also be able to take advantage of the applicable bidding credits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The rules that we adopt today are designed to ensure that only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
designated entities qualify for the special provisions established to ensure their participation in broadband
PCS. The rules are designed to enable designated entities to attract passive equity from non-designated entities,
provided that designated entities maintain control and a substantial entity stake in the ventures at all times. The
Commission will not tolerate ``fronts'' that are controlled by supposedly passive investors, and we will be vigilant
in preventing abuse of the designated entity provisions. Our rules are also designed to prevent designated entities
from assigning licenses obtained through the use of these special measures or who otherwise lose their designated
entity status before the end of a required five-year holding period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(1), permits auctions only where
mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses or construction permits are accepted for filing by the Commission
and where the principal use of the spectrum will involve or is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee
of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications
signals. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we concluded that PCS as a class of service would satisfy the section 309(j)(1) criteria for auctionability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para;54&hyph;58. Specifically, based on the record in this proceeding and in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314,
we concluded that the principal use of broadband PCS spectrum satisfied these auction criteria.

award that license through competitive bidding.

In the Second Report and Order, we addressed the only commenter who argued that the Commission should not find that
the principal use of PCS is likely to be for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second Report and Order at &para;&para; 55&hyph;56. The Commission rejected the argument of Millin Publications,
a publisher of specialized information services that intends to utilize PCS frequencies on a non-subscription basis,
that the Commission should refrain from making the principal use finding because PCS does not yet exist. We concluded
that the overwhelming weight of the comments in this proceeding, as well as our experience with the PCS experiments
that we have licensed, reflect that licensed PCS spectrum is likely to be used principally for the provision of service
to subscribers for compensation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. As noted above, we concluded in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the criteria in Section 309(j)(3) will be satisfied by competitive bidding for broadband PCS licenses, and thus
that broadband PCS should be subject to our competitive bidding procedures. We determined that the use of competitive
bidding to award broadband PCS licenses, as compared with other licensing methods, will speed the development and
deployment of new services to the public with minimal administrative or judicial delay, and will encourage efficient
use of the spectrum as required by Section 309(j)(3) (A) and (D). We also concluded that competitive bidding would
recover for the public a portion of the value of the spectrum, as envisioned in Section 309(j)(3)(C). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Finally, in accordance with Section 309(j)(3)(B), we adopted a set of open competitive bidding procedures and a menu
of special provisions designed to increase opportunities for designated entities who might otherwise face entry
barriers. Our views on this matter remain unchanged since adoption of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We therefore affirm in this Order the use of competitive bidding procedures to award broadband PCS licenses.

24. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established the criteria to be used in selecting which auction design method to use for each particular auctionable
service. Generally, we concluded that awarding licenses to those parties who value them most highly will foster Congress'
policy objectives. In this regard, we noted that since a bidder's ability to introduce valuable new services and to
deploy them quickly, intensively, and efficiently increases the value of a license to that bidder, an auction design
that awards licenses to those bidders with the highest willingness to pay tends to promote the development and rapid
deployment of new services and the efficient and intensive use of the spectrum. In articulating our auction design
principles we further stated that: (1) Licenses with strong value interdependencies should be auctioned simultaneously;
(2) multiple round auctions, by providing bidders with information regarding other bidders' valuations of licenses,
generally will yield more efficient allocations of licenses and higher revenues, especially where there is substantial
uncertainty as to value; and (3) because they are relatively expensive to implement and time-consuming, simultaneous
and/or multiple round auctions become less cost-effective as the value of licenses decreases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;69.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value
is expected to be high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals for competitive
bidding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para; 109&hyph;111. We indicated that compared with other bidding mechanisms, simultaneous multiple
round bidding will generate the most information about license values during the course of the auction and provide
bidders with the most flexibility to pursue back-up strategies. Thus, we concluded that simultaneous multiple round
bidding is most likely to award interdependent licenses to the bidders who value them the most. We also indicated that
this method will facilitate efficient aggregation of licenses across spectrum bands, thereby resulting in vigorous
competition among several strong service providers who will be able rapidly to introduce a wide variety of services
highly valued by end users. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 106. In addition, we concluded that because of the superior information and flexibility it provides, this
method is likely to yield greater revenues than other auction designs. Thus, we found that the use of simultaneous
multiple round auctions would generally be preferred. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. However, because simultaneous multiple round bidding is likely to be more administratively complex and costly
both for bidders and for the FCC than sequential or single round bidding, we indicated that we would use this auction
design only where license values are interdependent and the expected value of the licenses to be auctioned is high
relative to the costs of conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction. See Second Report and Order

27. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we considered several auction methods including simultaneous multiple round bidding, sequential bidding, and
combinatorial bidding. We discuss each of these below. We have chosen to adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions
as our auction methodology for broadband PCS licenses. We believe that for broadband licenses this method will best
meet Congress' goals in authorizing competitive bidding in section 309(j) of the Communications Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28. There is considerable support in the record for the use of simultaneous multiple round auctions, in which two or
more licenses are put up for bid at the same time, and there are multiple bidding rounds in which bidders have the opportunity
to top the high bids from the previous round. Several comments and studies in the record by academic auction experts
advocate simultaneous multiple round bidding for broadband PCS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also supports simultaneous multiple round bidding for broadband PCS auctions. We concluded that multiple round
bidding is generally superior to single round bidding, and that when licenses are interdependent, simultaneous
bidding is generally superior to sequential bidding. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, multiple-round auctions have the advantage over single-round auctions insofar as they provide more information
to bidders about the value that other bidders place on licenses, increasing the likelihood that the licenses are acquired
by those who value them most highly and increasing the revenue likely to be gained from the auction. Multiple-round
auctions are also more likely to be perceived as open and fair. The disadvantage of multiple round auctions is that
they have higher administrative costs than single round auctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, simultaneous auctions are more likely than sequential auctions to award interdependent licenses efficiently
because they provide more information about the value of interdependent licenses and allow the use of that information
because all licenses remain available throughout the bidding process. Simultaneous auctions are also likely to
raise more revenue than sequential auctions for two reasons. First, they increase the value of the licenses by facilitating
efficient aggregation. Second, because they provide more information about the value of interdependent licenses
they reduce the propensity of sophisticated bidders to bid cautiously in order to avoid the ``winner's curse''_the
tendency for the winner to be the bidder who most overestimates the value of the item up for bid. Simultaneous auctions
also eliminate the need to choose the order in which licenses will be auctioned. The advantage offered by simultaneous
auctions depends on how much interdependence exists among licenses.

31. We agree with commenters who support simultaneous multiple round bidding for awarding broadband PCS licenses.
Estimates of total PCS revenues by the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office indicate
that the value of broadband PCS licenses will likely be sufficiently high to warrant the use of simultaneous auctions.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 We further believe that the values of most broadband PCS licenses will be significantly interdependent because of
the desirability of aggregation across spectrum blocks and geographic regions and because there is a high degree
of substitutability among licenses with the same amount of spectrum and covering the same geographic area. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;&para;90&hyph;91. Compared with other bidding mechanisms, simultaneous multiple round bidding generates
the most information about license values during the course of the auction and provides bidders with the most flexibility
to pursue back-up strategies, and is therefore most likely to award licenses to the bidders who value them the most.
Simultaneous multiple round auctions will also facilitate efficient aggregation across spectrum bands, where
permitted, thereby enhancing competition among wireless products and services.

32. We recognize, however, that simultaneous multiple round bidding may involve a greater degree of complexity than
other competitive bidding methods, and that it may present greater operational difficulties both for the FCC and
for bidders, especially where many bidders are expected to participate. Therefore, we will use a sequence of simultaneous
auctions. Licenses that are highly interdependent will be grouped together and auctioned simultaneously.

2. Sequential Auctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
33. In a pure sequential auction, whether oral or electronic, licenses are put up for bid one at a time, so that bidding
ends on one item before it begins on the next item. Sequential multiple round oral or electronic auctions generate
valuable information about earlier auctioned licenses, which can assist bidders in valuing later auctioned licenses.
If license values are interdependent, however, sequential oral or electronic auctions are less likely than simultaneous
auctions to award interdependent licenses to the parties who value them most highly and to result in the efficient
aggregation of licenses, because bidders for licenses that are auctioned early must bid with less information about
the value of licenses to be auctioned later, and they will have less opportunity to pursue backup bidding strategies.
For these reasons, we conclude that sequential multiple round auctions are less preferred in the award of broadband
PCS licenses than simultaneous multiple round auctions. Nevertheless, if, as a result of our auction experience,
we determine that the operational costs or complexities associated with simultaneous multiple round auctions outweigh
their benefits, we may decide instead to employ pure sequential oral or electronic (multiple round) auctions or a
sequence of single combined oral auctions in which bidding is combined for all licenses in a given band with the same
bandwidth and the same geographic service area. If such a change becomes necessary, the auction method will be announced
by Public Notice before each auction.

34. If we should decide in the future to use sequential oral or sequential electronic bidding for relatively homogeneous
licenses, we will employ a single combined auction design. Under this approach, the Commission will combine bidding
for all licenses in the same band with the same amount of spectrum and same geographic service area.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Licenses will be awarded market by market to the highest bidders until all the available licenses are exhausted, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, two relatively homogeneous licenses would be awarded to the two highest bidders. Because broadband PCS licenses
may not be perfectly homogeneous (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidders may prefer one frequency over another within the same geographic region for purposes of efficient aggregation),
winning bidders will be given the opportunity to choose among licenses for which bidding is combined in descending
order of their bid amounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Combinatorial Bidding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
35. In general terms, combinatorial bidding allows bidders to bid for multiple licenses as all-or-nothing packages.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Combinatorial bidding can be implemented with either simultaneous or sequential auction designs. Although we recognized
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that there may be significant benefits associated with combinatorial bidding, especially in terms of efficient
aggregation of licenses, we concluded that simultaneous multiple round auctions offer many of the same advantages
without the same degree of administrative and operational complexity and without biasing auction outcomes in favor
of combination bids. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para; 101&hyph;105. On balance, we believe that the advantages of combinatorial bidding appear unlikely
to outweigh the disadvantages. While broadband PCS licenses are likely to be worth more to some bidders as a part of
a package, we believe that simultaneous multiple round bidding will provide these bidders with ample opportunity
to express the value of interdependent licenses. Moreover, we conclude that there will not be any extreme discontinuity
in value if some licenses in a package are not obtained. We believe that the opportunity to acquire licenses in post-auction
transactions and the ability to withdraw bids (upon payment of the bid withdrawal penalty) will limit the risks associated
with failing to acquire all of the licenses in a desired package. Nevertheless, if, based on our experience with the
initial simultaneous multiple round auctions and auction experiments, we determine that such auctions do not result
in efficient aggregation of licenses, and if there are significant advances in the development of combinatorial
auctions, we may, by public notice prior to a specific auction, choose to use combinatorial bidding techniques in
conjunction with simultaneous multiple round auctions.

In combinatorial bidding, if a bid for a group of licenses exceeds the sum of the highest bids for the individual licenses
that comprise the package, then the package bid would win. In the Second Report and Order we also indicated that if we
were to utilize combinatorial bidding we might institute a premium so that the combinatorial bid would win only if
it exceeded the sum of the bids for individual licenses by a set amount.

1. Grouping of Licenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
36. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission concluded that highly interdependent licenses should be grouped together and put up for bid at the
same time in a multiple round auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para; 106&hyph;107. This will facilitate awarding licenses to the bidders who value them most highly because
it will provide bidders information about the prices of complementary and substitutable licenses while such licenses
are still up for bid. The magnitude of the benefit of auctioning a group of licenses together in a simultaneous multiple
round auction increases with the degree of interdependence among the licenses. On the other hand, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also noted that the cost and complexity, both for the FCC and for bidders, of auctioning a very large number of interdependent
licenses simultaneously may outweigh the informational and bidding flexibility advantages. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 107. Accordingly, although we believe that all broadband PCS licenses are interdependent, we will not auction
them all simultaneously. Instead, we will divide the licenses into three groups by combining those licenses that
are most closely related so that there will be limited interdependence across groups. Then we will sequentially conduct
a separate simultaneous multiple round auction for each group. We formed the three groups in two conceptual steps.
First, we separated the ``entrepreneurs''' blocks (C and F) from all other blocks.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Then, we separated the large unrestricted blocks (A and B, with 30 MHz of spectrum and MTA geographic scope) from the
small ones (D and E, with 10 MHz of spectrum and BTA geographic scope).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in more detail below, we establish economic eligibility criteria for bidders in blocks C and F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
37. In the first auction, the 99 available MTA licenses in blocks A and B will be put up for bid. In the second auction,
the 986 BTA licenses in blocks C and F will be put up for bid. And in the last auction, the 986 BTA licenses in blocks D and
E will be put up for bid. As explained below, we believe that this grouping strikes a proper balance among the competing
concerns of awarding licenses to the parties who value them most highly, keeping the auction process simple and manageable,
minimizing administrative delay, and fostering designated entity participation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38. Separating the entrepreneurs' blocks (C and F) from all other blocks entails little loss of efficiency because
most firms are likely to be interested in licenses in either the entrepreneurs' blocks or the non-restricted blocks,
but not both. Large firms cannot bid on entrepreneurs' licenses, although they may partner with firms that can. Small
firms can bid on all blocks, but are likely to be most interested in the entrepreneurs' blocks because on these blocks
they would not be placed in the position of bidding against large firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. In addition to reducing the complexity of the auctions, auctioning block C licenses after the block A and B licenses
is likely to further another objective of auction design_fostering designated entity participation_by enabling
designated entities to more easily attract partners. Many potential partners may be unwilling to commit themselves
to a partnership arrangement with designated entities prior to the auction of licenses on the A and B blocks. So, designated
entities that are unable to raise independent financing for at least the required upfront and down payments may have
difficulty participating in an auction in which block C is put up for bid simultaneously with blocks A and B. If, however,
block C is auctioned after blocks A and B, we expect that non-designated entities who are unsuccessful in acquiring
MTA licenses on blocks A and B will want to become partners with or make investments in designated entities so as to gain
an interest in 30 MHz licenses on block C. In addition, the auction on blocks A and B will produce price information that
would be valuable to designated entities in their business planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. The efficiency loss associated with separating the large unrestricted blocks (A and B) from the small ones (D and
E) depends on the degree of substitutability and complementarity between licenses in these two groups. Auctioning
licenses on the D and E blocks separately from those on the A and B blocks may make it more difficult for bidders to pursue
a back-up strategy of combining two 10 MHz licenses in the same geographic areas as an alternative to acquiring 30 MHz
licenses in the A or B blocks. We believe, however, that this is not likely to be a widely used strategy, because the licenses
are defined on a BTA basis while the licenses on the A and B blocks are defined on a MTA basis. It is also possible that some
bidders may wish to combine a 10 MHz license with a 30 MHz license in the same geographic area. Although this approach
would be easier to pursue if blocks A, B, D and E were auctioned together, we believe that in most cases the amount bidders
would be willing to pay for a block A or B license would not be strongly affected by whether they were able to acquire a
complementary block D or E license. So auctioning blocks D and E after blocks A and B would not significantly hinder
combining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses. We conclude that the benefits of administrative simplicity from auctioning
license on blocks A and B separately from those on blocks D and E are likely to outweigh the possible loss of efficiency.

2. Bid Increments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
41. In using simultaneous multiple round auctions to award broadband PCS licenses, it is important to specify minimum
bid increments.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order
to be accepted as a valid bid in the current bidding round. The application of a minimum bid increment speeds the progress
of the auction and, along with activity and stopping rules, helps to ensure that the auction comes to closure within
a reasonable period of time. Establishing an appropriate minimum bid increment is especially important in a simultaneous
auction with a simultaneous closing rule. In that case, all markets remain open until there is no bidding on any license,
and a delay in closing one market will delay the closing of all markets.

42. Because we plan to use simultaneous multiple round auctions to award broadband PCS licenses, we believe that it
is necessary to impose a minimum bid increment to ensure that the broadband PCS auctions conclude within a reasonable
period of time. Commenters addressing the issue generally supported a minimum bid increment of 5 percent. PacTel,
for example, argues that this amount will provide a reasonable compromise between the goal of completing the auction
quickly and that of revealing information about the distribution of valuations among bidders.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 As we recognized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is important in establishing the amount of the minimum bid increment to express such increment as the greater of
a percentage and fixed dollar amount. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;126. This will ensure a timely completion of the auction even if bidding begins at a very low dollar amount.
Accordingly, we will impose a minimum bid increment of some percentage of the high bid from the previous round or a dollar
amount per MHz per pop, whichever is greater, in broadband PCS auctions where multiple round bidding is used.

``Pop'' refers to each member of the population of the license service area and ``MHz'' refers to the amount of spectrum,
in megahertz, that the licensee is permitted to use. For example, for a 30 MHz license with a population of 10 million,
if the minimum bid increment were the greater of 5 percent or $0.02 per MHz per pop, the minimum bid increment would be
$6 million ($0.02&times;30 MHz&times;10,000,000) when the high bid from the previous round is less than $120 million.
If the high bid from the previous round exceeds $120 million, the minimum bid would be 5 percent of the value of that bid
(since 5 percent of a bid over $120 million is greater than $6 million).

43. PacTel also suggests, in the context of simultaneous auctions, that the Commission should vary the bid increment,
reducing it as the number of active bidders declines.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, PacBell suggests that the bid increment depend on the stage of the auction, with a 5 percent increment in
stage I, 2 percent in stage II, and 1 percent in stage III.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 This would move the auction quickly at the beginning, when prices have limited informational content and there is
little benefit to either bidders or the Commission of refined price movements, while allowing bidders to express
small differences in valuations as the auction nears a close, increasing both efficiency and auction revenues. Small
bid increments also reduce the chances of ties. Where a tie does occur, the high bidder will be determined by the order
in which the bids were received by the Commission.

falls. The minimum bid increment in stage I of the auction will be 5 percent of the high bid in the previous round or $.02
per MHz per pop, whichever is greater.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 We will reduce the minimum bid increment as we move through the auction stages, with a minimum bid increment of the greater

45. In addition, the Commission will establish a suggested minimum bid on each license. Bids below the suggested minimum
bid will count as activity under the activity rule (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received. Initial bids must be above the minimum bid increment
of $.02 per MHz per pop, but may be below the suggested minimum bid. Once a bid has been received on a license, the suggested
minimum bid is no longer applicable in subsequent rounds. The amount of the suggested minimum bid may vary by market
size, with a larger minimum bid in larger markets, and will be announced by public notice prior to each auction. We will
establish suggested minimum bids at no less than $.05 per MHz per pop and not more than $.20 per MHz per pop. The suggested
minimum bid provides bidders an incentive to start bidding at a substantial fraction of the final prices of licenses,
thus ensuring a rapid conclusion of the auction, while still allowing for bidding on licenses whose market values
are below the suggested minimum bids.

3. Stopping Rules for Multiple Round Auctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
46. We also noted in the Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that with multiple round auctions a stopping rule must be established for determining when the auction is over.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 In simultaneous multiple round auctions, bidding may close separately on individual licenses, simultaneously
on all licenses, or a hybrid approach may be used. Under an individual, license-by-license approach, bidding closes
on each license after one round passes in which no new acceptable bids are submitted for that particular license. With
a simultaneous stopping rule, bidding remains open on all licenses until there is no new acceptable bid on any license.
This approach has the advantage of providing bidders full flexibility to bid for any license as more information becomes
available during the course of the auction, but it may lead to very long auctions, unless an activity rule (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is imposed. A hybrid approach combines the first two stopping rules. For example, we may use a simultaneous stopping
rule (along with an activity rule designed to expedite closure for licenses subject to the simultaneous stopping
rule) for the higher value licenses. For lower value licenses, where the loss from eliminating some back-up strategies
is less, we may use simpler license-by-license closings. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

efficiency or expected revenue.

 Second Report and Order at &para;127. Commenters agreed on the importance of the appropriate stopping rule. PacTel
proposes that bidding on an individual license close if there are no new bids on that license within a given round, or
if there are fewer than two bids greater than a ``suggested minimum bid.'' Comments of PacTel, Attachment of R. Preston
McAfee at 16&hyph;18. Pacific Bell recommends simultaneous closing of bidding on all licenses when there are no new
acceptable bids on any license. Comments of PacBell, Attachment of Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson at 19; reply comments
of PacBell, Attachment of Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson, Appendix at 5. Bell Atlantic Personal Communications,
on the other hand, asserts that in simultaneous auctions, no stopping rule can prevent strategic delays. They provide
no evidence for this, however, and do not discuss any closing rule in detail. In discussing the Milgrom-Wilson closing
rule they fail to account for the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule, which will reduce the likelihood of delay, and the
fail-safe closing mechanism proposed by Milgrom and Wilson. Reply comments of Bell Atlantic Personal Communications,

47. For broadband PCS we believe that a simultaneous stopping rule is preferable for all MTA licenses. MTA licenses
are expected to have relatively high values and are fewer in number than BTA licenses, which will reduce the complexity
of implementing a simultaneous stopping rule. Since we intend to impose an activity rule (as discussed below), we
believe that allowing simultaneous closing for all licenses will afford bidders flexibility to pursue back-up strategies
without running the risk that bidders will hold back their bidding until the final rounds. We also intend to use a simultaneous
stopping rule for BTA licenses. However, because of the large number of BTA licenses, we retain the discretion either
to use a hybrid stopping rule or to allow bidding to close individually for these licenses if as we gain experience with
auctions we determine that simultaneous stopping rules are too complex to implement for very large numbers of licenses.
The specific stopping rule for ending bidding on BTA licenses will be announced by Public Notice prior to auction.

48. In addition, we will retain the discretion to declare at any point after 40 rounds in a simultaneous multiple round
auction that the auction will end after some specified number of additional rounds.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 This gives the Commission a means to prevent bidders from continuing to bid on a few low value licenses solely to delay
the closing for all licenses in an auction with a simultaneous closing rule. This will also ensure that the Commission
can end the auction if it determines that the benefits from ending the auction, and hence issuing licenses more rapidly,
exceeds the possible efficiency loss from cutting off bidding on a few low value licenses. If we exercise this option,
we favor the use of three final rounds. Allowing more than one additional round provides some opportunity for counter-offers,
thus reducing the risk that a license will not be awarded to the party that values it most highly.

PacBell proposed that in case of inordinate delays in the auction the Commission should have the ability to conclude
the auction at any time after 40 rounds by issuing a call for final bids on the following business day for each of those
licenses for which the highest bid increased in at least 1 of the preceding 3 rounds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

49. Moreover, if this fail-safe mechanism is used, we will accept bids in the final round(s) only for licenses on which
the highest bid increased in at least one of the preceding three rounds. No new bids will be accepted for other licenses.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 There are two reasons not to take bids on licenses on which there has been no recent bidding. First, the fact that bidding
on an individual license may close will provide an additional incentive to bid actively and thus speed the conclusion
of the auction. If bids are accepted on all licenses in the final round(s) there is less cost to a bidder in holding back.
Second, closing bidding on licenses for which activity has ceased ensures high bidders for those licenses that they
will not lose a license without having an opportunity to make a counter-offer.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 This reduces the uncertainty associated with aggregating licenses that are worth more as a package than individually.
If final bids are accepted on all licenses, a high bidder on an aggregation of licenses may unexpectedly lose a critical
part of the aggregation and have no chance to regain it except in the post-auction market, where bargaining or other
transaction costs may be high.

Either the auction will close only when bidding ceases on all licenses, so the high bidder will have an opportunity
to respond to any new bids, or the Commission will call for final bids but not accept new bids on licenses on which there
have been no new bids in the previous three rounds, so no other bidder will have the opportunity to outbid the high bidder
in a final round.

4. Duration of Bidding Rounds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50. In simultaneous multiple round auctions for large numbers of interdependent high-value licenses, bidders may
need a significant amount of time to evaluate back-up strategies and consult with their principals. For this reason,
PacBell proposes one bidding round per day and PacTel proposes three business days per bidding round for broadband
PCS.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 We will provide bidders with a single business day to submit bids, and conduct one round of bidding each business day.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 However, we reserve the discretion to vary, by public notice or announcement, the duration of bidding rounds or the
interval at which bids are accepted (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 run two or more rounds per day rather than one), in order to move the auction toward closure more quickly. We are more
likely to conduct more than one round per day early in an auction than towards the end of an auction. At early stages of
an auction prices will be low and contain relatively little information, so bidders will need less time to deliberate.
It is in the final stages of an auction, when the consequences of bidding decisions are greatest, that bidders need
the most time to deliberate. We will indicate either by Public Notice prior to an auction, or by announcement during
an auction any changes to the duration of and intervals between bidding rounds.

With one round per day, the auction may take weeks to complete. This should not impose an excessive burden on bidders,
however, because bids may be submitted by telephone or by a computer connected to a telephone line, so bidders need
not have a representative in Washington throughout the auction.

5. Activity Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
51. As discussed above, in order to ensure that simultaneous auctions with simultaneous stopping rules close within
a reasonable period of time and to increase the information conveyed by bid prices during the auction, we believe that
it is necessary to impose an activity rule to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before participating.
Because simultaneous stopping rules generally keep all licenses open for bidding as long as anyone wishes to bid,
they also create an incentive for bidders to hold back until prices approach equilibrium before making a bid. As noted
above, this could lead to very long auctions. Delaying serious bidding until late in the auction also reduces the information
content of prices during the course of an auction. Without an activity rule, bidders cannot know whether a low level
of bidding on a license means that the license price is near its final level or if instead many serious bidders are holding
back and may bid up the price later in the auction.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 An activity rule is less important when licenses close one-by-one because failure to participate in any given round
may result in losing the opportunity to bid at all, if that round turns out to be the last.

52. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we adopted the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule as our preferred activity rule where a simultaneous stopping rule is
used. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;&para;144&hyph;145. The Milgrom-Wilson approach encourages bidders to participate in early rounds by
limiting their maximum participation to some multiple of their minimum participation level. Bidders are required
to declare their maximum eligibility in terms of MHz-pops, and make an upfront payment equal to $0.02 per MHz-pop.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) That is, in each round bidders will be limited to bidding on licenses encompassing no more than the number of MHz-pops
covered by their upfront payment. Licenses on which a bidder is the high bidder from the previous round count against
this bidding limit. Under this approach, bidders will have the flexibility to shift their bids among any licenses
for which they have applied so long as, within each round, the total MHz-pops encompassed by those licenses does not
exceed the total number of MHz-pops on which they are eligible to bid. Bidders will be able to secure the option to participate
at whatever maximum level they deem appropriate by making a sufficient upfront payment. To preserve their maximum
eligibility, however, bidders will be required to maintain activity during each round of the auction. A bidder is
considered active on a license in the current round if the bidder has submitted an acceptable bid for that license in
the current round, or has the high bid for that license from the previous round, in which case, the bidder does not need
to bid on that license in the current round to be considered active on that license.

The number of ``MHz-pops'' is calculated by multiplying the population of the license service area by the amount of
spectrum authorized by the license. We use the terms ``per MHz-pop'' and ``per MHz per pop'' interchangeably.

53. Under the Milgrom-Wilson proposal, the minimum activity level, measured as a fraction of the bidder's eligibility
in the current round, will increase during the course of the auction.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 Milgrom and Wilson divide the auction into three stages. During the first stage of the auction, a bidder is required
to be active on licenses encompassing one-third of the MHz-pops for which it is eligible. The ``penalty'' for falling
below that activity level is a reduction in eligibility. At this stage, bidders will lose three MHz-pops in eligibility
for each MHz-pop below the minimum required activity level.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 In the second stage, bidders are required to be active on two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. The
penalty for falling below that activity level is a loss of 1.5 MHz-pops in eligibility for each MHz-pop below the minimum
required activity level. In the third stage, bidders are required to be active on licenses encompassing all of the
MHz-pops for which they are eligible. The penalty for falling below that activity level is a loss of one MHz-pop in eligibility
for each MHz-pop below the minimum required activity level. Thus in the final stage, each bidder retains eligibility
(for the next round) equal to the MHz-pops for which it is an active bidder in the current round.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
), a bidder's eligibility (in terms of MHz-pops) in the current round is determined by the bidder's activity level
and eligibility in the previous round. In the first round, however, eligibility is determined by the bidder's upfront
payment and is equal to the upfront payment divided by $.02 per MHz-pop.

An alternative way to state the rule for determining eligibility in stage I of an auction is that each bidder will be
eligible to bid in the next round on three times the MHz-pops for which it is an active bidder in the current round, or
the MHz-pops for which it is eligible in the current round, whichever is less.

54. The auction will start in stage I and move from stage I to stage II when, in each of three consecutive rounds of bidding,
the high bid has increased on 10 percent or less of the spectrum (measured in terms of MHz-pops) being auctioned.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 The auction will move from stage II to stage III when the high bid has increased on 5 percent or less of the spectrum being
auctioned (measured in terms of MHz-pops), in each of three consecutive rounds of bidding in stage II.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 In order to speed up an auction, the Commission may also announce, at any time after the initial 15 rounds, that the next
stage of the auction (with a higher minimum participation level) will begin in the next bidding round.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, if as the Commission gains experience with auctions that use activity rules it determines that such auctions
tend to move too slowly, it may, by public notice prior to a specific auction, increase the activity levels at which
that auction moves between stages. Conversely, if the Commission determines that auctions tend to move too quickly,
depriving bidders of sufficient time to deliberate and pursue back-up strategies, it may decrease the activity levels
at which an auction moves between stages.

The transition rule may also be defined in terms of the ``auction activity level''_the sum of the MHz-pops of those
licenses whose highest bid increased in the current round, as a percentage of the total MHz-pops of all licenses in
that auction. (Note that this definition differs slightly from that used by Milgrom and Wilson.

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
reply comments by PacBell, Appendix to attachment by Milgrom and Wilson at 1.) The auction moves from stage I to stage
II when the auction activity level is less than or equal to 10 percent for three consecutive rounds in stage I. The auction
moves from stage II to stage III when the auction activity level is less than or equal to 5 percent for three consecutive
rounds in stage II. For example, if two nationwide 30 MHz blocks of spectrum are put up for bid and the national population
is approximately 250 million, a total of approximately 15,000 million MHz-pops would be available in the auction.
If in stage I of the auction, the high bid increases on licenses encompassing less than 1,500 million MHz-pops for three
consecutive rounds, the auction moves to stage II. This would be the case, for example, if in three consecutive rounds
new bids were received on only a license for the New York MTA (26 million pops) and a license for the Los Angeles MTA (19
million pops), since the two licenses encompass a total of 1,350 million MHz-pops. Once in stage II, if in each of three
consecutive rounds new acceptable bids are received on licenses encompassing less than 750 million MHz-pops, the
auction would move to stage III.

55. Finally, to avoid the consequences of clerical errors and to compensate for unusual circumstances that might
delay a bidder's bid preparation or submission on a particular day, Milgrom and Wilson recommend permitting each
bidder to request and automatically receive a waiver of the activity rule once every three rounds. We believe that
some waiver procedure is a critical element of the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule, since the Commission would not wish
to reduce a bidder's eligibility due to an accidental act or circumstances not under the bidder's control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. We believe that the Milgrom-Wilson approach will best achieve the Commission's goals of affording bidders flexibility
to pursue backup strategies, while at the same time ensuring that simultaneous auctions are concluded within a reasonable
period of time. Accordingly, we plan to impose such an activity rule in conjunction with a simultaneous stopping rule
to award higher value broadband PCS licenses. We intend, however, to use a simpler waiver procedure than that proposed
by Milgrom and Wilson. We will permit bidders one automatic waiver from the activity rule during each stage of an auction.
A waiver will permit a bidder to maintain its eligibility at the same level as in the round for which the waiver is submitted.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 A waiver may be submitted either in the round in which bidding falls below the minimum required level to maintain (for
the next round) the same eligibility as in that round, or prior to submitting a bid in the next round. If an activity rule
waiver is entered in a round in which no other bidding activity occurs, the auction will remain open.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 However, an activity rule waiver entered after a round in which no other bidding activity occurs will not reopen the
auction. If, as we gain both experimental and actual auction experience, we determine that permitting one automatic
waiver per auction stage is insufficient to prevent the inadvertent reduction in eligibility of serious bidders,
we may, by public notice prior to a specific broadband auction, increase the number of automatic activity rule waivers,
or instead allow one automatic waiver during a specified number of bidding rounds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission established general competitive bidding rules and procedures which we noted may be modified on a service-specific
basis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR Part 1, subpart Q. As discussed below, we will generally follow the procedural, payment and penalty rules established
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with certain minor modifications designed to address the particular characteristics of the broadband PCS service.
These rules are structured to ensure that bidders and licensees are qualified and will be able to construct systems
quickly and other service to the public. By ensuring that bidders and license winners are serious, qualified applicants,
these rules will minimize the need to re-auction licenses and prevent delays in the provision of broadband PCS service
to the public. In addition, as we proposed in the Notice at &para; 129, we adopt general procedural and processing rules
based on Part 22 of the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. Section 309(j)(5) provides that no party may participate in an auction ``unless such bidder submits such information
and assurances as the Commission may require to demonstrate that such bidder's application is acceptable for filing.''
47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(5). Moreover, ``[n]o license shall be granted to an applicant selected pursuant to this subsection
unless the Commission determines that the applicant is qualified pursuant to [Section 309(a)] and Sections 308(b)
and 310'' of the Communications Act.

id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the legislative history of Section 309(j) makes clear, the Commission may require that bidders' applications
contain all information and documentation sufficient to demonstrate that the application is not in violation of
Commission rules, and applications not meeting those requirements may be dismissed prior to the competitive bidding.

60. In the MPRM, we proposed that all parties interested in participating in an auction for spectrum licenses would
be required to file a short-form application (modeled on the Commission's ``Transmittal Sheet for Cellular Applications''),
and asked whether applicants should also be required to submit a long-form application prior to the auction, or whether
the long-form application should be submitted subsequent to the auction. NPRM at &para; 97. The comments generally
agreed that we should require only a short-form application prior to competitive bidding, and that only winning bidders
should be required to submit a long-form license application after the auction. Because we believed that such a procedure
would fulfill the statutory requirements and objectives and adequately protect the public interest, we incorporated
these requirements into the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;&sect;1.2105 and 1.2107. We will extend the application of these rules to the competitive bidding process
for broadband PCS.

61. We will be guided by the following procedures in conducting broadband PCS auctions. The Commission will release
an initial Public Notice announcing that it will accept applications for specific broadband PCS licenses. This initial
Public Notice will specify the licenses and identify the time and place of an auction in the event that mutually exclusive
applications are filed. The Public Notice also will specify the method of competitive bidding to be used, including
applicable bid submission procedures, stopping rules and activity rules, as well as the deadline by which short-form
applications must be filed, and the amounts and deadlines for submitting the upfront payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para; 164. We will not accept applications filed before or after the dates specified in Public Notices. Applications
submitted before release of a Public Notice announcing the availability of particular license(s), or before the
opening date of the filing window specified therein, will be returned as premature. Applications submitted after
the deadline specified by Public Notice will be dismissed, with prejudice, as untimely. Soon after release of the
initial Public Notice, an auction information package will be made available to prospective bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. Bidders will be required to submit short-form applications on FCC Form 175 (and FCC Form 175&hyph;S, if applicable),
together with any applicable filing fee
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 by the date specified in the initial Public Notice.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The short-form applications will require applicants to provide the information required by Section 1.2105(a)(2)
of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR &sect;1.2105(a)(2). Specifically, each applicant will be required to specify
on its Form 175 applications certain identifying information, including its status as a designated entity (if applicable),
its classification (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
individual, corporation, partnership, trust or other), the markets and frequently blocks for which it is applying,
and assuming that the licenses will be auctioned, the names of persons authorized to place or withdraw a bid on its behalf.
In addition, applicants will be required to provide detailed ownership information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 24.813(a) of the Commission's Rules) and identify all parties with whom they have entered into any consortium
arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships or other agreements or understandings which relate to the competitive
bidding process. Applicants will also be required to certify that they have not entered and will not enter into any
explicit or implicit agreements, arrangements or understandings with any parties, other than those identified,
regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular properties on which they will or will not bid.
In addition, applicants for licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be required, as part of their short-form applications,
to certify that they are eligible to bid on and win licenses in those blocks. Among other things, this means that they
are in compliance with our PCS-cellular and PCS&hyph;PCS cross-ownership limitations. As we indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, if the Commission receives only one application that is acceptable for filing for a particular license, and thus
there is no mutual exclusivity, the Commission by Public Notice will cancel the auction for this license and establish
a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which will trigger the procedures permitting petitions
to deny. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Because Section 8 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. &sect;158, does not currently afford the Commission authority
to charge an application fee in connection with PCS applications, broadband PCS applicants will not be required to
submit a fee with their short-form application. However, the Commission has requested that Congress amend Section
8 of the Communications Act to provide a specific application fee for PCS services. If the Commission receives application
fee authority, the general rules governing submission of fees will apply.

. These rules currently provide for dismissal of an application if the application fee is not paid, is insufficient,

63. A number of commenters in this proceeding objected to our original tentative conclusion that short-form applications
should be judged by a letter-perfect standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NPRM at &para; 100. Parties proposed that the Commission allow a brief period for correcting errors in short-form
applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we believe that the public interest would be better served by encouraging maximum bidder participation in auctions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

applications (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
typographical errors, incorrect license designations, etc.) prior to the auction. Applicants will not be permitted
until after the auction, however, to make any major modifications to their applications, including cognizable ownership
changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia. In addition, applications that are not
signed will be dismissed as unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. After reviewing the short-form applications, the Commission will issue a second Public Notice listing all defective
applications, and applicants whose applications contain minor defects will be given an opportunity to cure defective
applications and resubmit a correction version.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release a third Public Notice announcing the names
of all applicants whose applications have been accepted for filing. These applicants will be required to submit an
upfront payment to the Commission, as discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
65. The comments in this proceeding generally supported the Commission's proposal to require prospective bidders
to make substantial upfront payments prior to auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
comments of Comcast at 18, PacBell at 28, Nextel at 16, and AWCC at 31&hyph;32. Consistent with the weight of the comments,
we concluded in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that a substantial upfront payment prior to the beginning of an auction is necessary to ensure that only serious and
qualified bidders participate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 171. By requiring such a payment we also help to ensure that any bid withdrawal or default penalties are paid.
These considerations apply to broadband PCS auctions. We will therefore require all broadband PCS auction participants
to tender in advance to the Commission a substantial upfront payment as a condition of bidding.

66. In the Notice, we proposed to require upfront payments based on a $0.02 per MHz per pop formula. Though some commenters
favor a fixed upfront payment set by the Commission prior to the auction,
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 most support the Commission's proposed $0.02 per MHz per pop formula, which would enable prospective bidders to tailor
their upfront payment to their bidding strategies.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters suggest that there should be some fixed minimum on the amount of upfront payment made prior to auction (suggestions
range from $2,500 to $100,000 for different services).
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 Some commenters also favor setting a maximum upfront payment, pointing out that our proposed formula yields very
high payments in the broadband PCS context.

67. We believe that the standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops
a bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for broadband PCS services.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 Using this formula will provide bidders with the flexibility to change their strategy during an auction and to bid
on a larger number of smaller licenses or a smaller number of larger licenses, so long as the total MHz-pops combination
does not exceed that amount covered by the upfront payment. For example, when we auction licenses covering the nation
simultaneously, a bidder would not be required to file an upfront payment representing national coverage unless
it intended to bid on licenses covering the entire nation in a single bidding round. The $0.02 per MHz per pop formula
also works well with the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule that we plan to employ in broadband PCS auctions, as described
in Section III above. In the initial Public Notice issued prior to each auction, we will announce population information
corresponding to each license to enable bidders to calculate their upfront payments.

infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, designated entities will be subject to a lesser upfront payment requirement of $0.015 per MHz per pop. Further, we
retain the flexibility to consider using a simpler payment requirement if circumstances warrant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we will not set a maximum on upfront payments.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 We decline to do so because we wish to ensure that those bidding on large numbers of valuable broadband PCS licenses
are bidding in good faith and are financially capable of constructing those systems quickly. We recognize that upfront
payments for broadband PCS licenses may amount to millions of dollars, but we do not believe that it is unreasonable
to expect prospective bidders to tender such sums given the expected overall value of some of these licenses and the
expected financial requirements to construct the systems. Indeed, such a requirement is necessary to ensure the
seriousness of bidders for these valuable licenses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we accepted commenters' suggestions and established a general minimum upfront payment of $2,500 to ensure that
the use of our preferred formula would result in a substantial enough payment that bidders would be deterred from making
frivolous bids.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 Such a minimum upfront payment is needed in connection with auctions where the $0.02 per MHz per pop formula would yield
a comparatively small upfront payment (such as those for narrowband PCS licenses in BTAs). Because of the wider bandwidth
of broadband PCS licenses, however, this minimum upfront payment will not be relevant in auctions for this service.

The smallest bandwidth that a broadband PCS licensee will be authorized to use is 10 MHz, so a $2,500 upfront payment
would result for a license area with a population of only 12,500 persons. The least populous BTA in the United States
(Williston, North Dakota) has a population of approximately 27,500, and the upfront payment for a 10 MHz license in
that BTA would be approximately $5,500.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Applicants whose short-form applications have been accepted for filing will be required to submit the full amount
of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date certain, which will be announced in a Public Notice
and generally will be no later than 14 days before the scheduled auction.
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 After the Commission receives from its lock-box bank the names of all applicants who have submitted timely upfront
payments, the Commission will issue a Public Notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined
to be qualified to bid. An applicant who fails to submit a sufficient upfront payment to qualify it to bid on any license
being auctioned will not be identified on this Public Notice as a qualified bidder, and it will be prohibited from bidding
in the auction. That is, we will require that applicants for broadband PCS licenses submit a sufficient upfront payment
to reflect the MHz-pops of the smallest license being put up for bid in a particular auction.

For example, in our first broadband PCS auction (the 30 MHz MTA licenses on blocks A and B), the smallest upfront payment
that may be submitted to qualify an applicant to bid will be calculated by multiplying the population of the least populous
MTA (American Samoa: population 47,000) times 30 times two cents, or $28,200. It should be noted, however, that this
minimal upfront payment will entitle the bidder to bid only on a license to serve American Samoa.

71. Although it would be simpler to require the submission of upfront payments at the same time short-form applications
are filed, we agree with those commenters that argued that they should not be required to commit the large sums that
will likely be involved in broadband PCS upfront payment for longer than is necessary. Accordingly, applicants will
not be required to tender upfront payments with their short-form applications. Instead, as noted above, upfront
payments will be due by a date specified by Public Notice, but generally no later than 14 days before a scheduled auction.
This period should be sufficient to allow the Commission adequate time to process upfront payment data and release
a Public Notice listing all qualified bidders, but not so long as to impose undue burdens upon bidders. The rules set
forth in Section 1.2106 of the Commission's Rules concerning upfront payments will be applicable in broadband PCS
auctions. Each qualified bidder will be issued a bidder identification number and further information and instructions
regarding the auction procedures. During an auction, bidders will be required to provide their bidder identification
numbers when submitting bids.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established a 20 percent down payment by winning bidders to discourage default between the auction and licensing
and to ensure payment of the penalty if such default occurs. We concluded that a 20 percent down payment was appropriate
to ensure that auction winners have the necessary financial capabilities to complete payment for the license and
to pay for the costs of constructing a system, while at the same time not being so onerous as to hinder growth or diminish
access. Most of the commenters addressing this issue generally support our proposal that winning bidders increase
their deposits with the Commission up to an amount equalling 20 percent of their winning bid or bids.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, comments of BellSouth at 43&hyph;44, PageNet at 35&hyph;36, and Telocator at 13. Some commenters feel that a 20 percent
down payment requirement would be too high.

 comments of Sprint at 18 (prefers a 10 percent down payment).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
73. We believe that the reasoning that led us to conclude that 20 percent is the appropriate down payment applies to
broadband PCS auctions. We therefore will require that, with the exception of bidders eligible for installment payments
in the entrepreneurs' blocks (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), winning bidders in broadband PCS auctions supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to
bring their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s).
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 Winning bidders will be required to submit the required down payment by cashier's check or wire transfer to our lock-box
bank by a date to be specified by Public Notice, generally within five (5) business days following the close of bidding.
All auction winners will generally be required to make full payment of the balance of their winning bids within five
(5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned on this payment.

If the upfront payment already tendered by a winning bidder, after deducting any bid withdrawal and default penalties
due, amounts to 20 percent or more of its winning bids, no additional deposit will be required. If the upfront payment
amount on deposit is greater than 20 percent of the winning bid amount after deducting any bid withdrawal and default
penalties due, the additional monies will be refunded. If a bidder has withdrawn a bid or defaulted but the amount of
the penalty cannot yet be determined, the bidder will be required to make a deposit of 20 percent of the amount bid on
such licenses. When it becomes possible to calculate and assess the penalty, any excess deposit will be refunded.
Upfront payments will be applied to such deposits and to bid withdrawal and default penalties due before being applied
toward the bidder's down payment on licenses the bidder has won and seeks to acquire.

Commission up to only 5 percent of its winning bid after the bidding closes, and will pay an additional 5 percent of its
winning bid to the Commission after a license is granted.

2. Bid Withdrawal and Default Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
75. As we discussed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is critically important to the success of our system of competitive bidding that potential bidders understand
that there will be a substantial penalty assessed if they withdraw a high bid, are found not to be qualified to hold licenses
or default on payment of a balance due. There was substantial support in the comments for the notion that the Commission
is authorized to and should order forfeiture of upfront and down payments if the auction winner later defaults or is
disqualified. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, comments of CTIA at 29&hyph;30, AT&amp;T at 35, n.43, PageNet at 35&hyph;36, Cook Inlet at 47, and BellSouth at 42&hyph;44.
We concluded, however, that forfeiture of all amounts that a bidder may have on deposit with the Commission may, in
some circumstances, be too severe a penalty and would not necessarily be rationally related to the harm caused by withdrawal,
default or disqualification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 197.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. This logic applies to broadband PCS auctions, so for these auctions we will employ the bid withdrawal, default
and disqualification penalties adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which are reflected in Sections 1.2104(g) and 1.2109 of the Commission's Rules. Any bidder who withdraws a high bid
during an auction before the Commission declares bidding closed will be required to reimburse the Commission in the
amount of the difference between its high bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by
the Commission, if this subsequent winning bid is lower than the withdrawn bid.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 No withdrawal penalty will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. After bidding closes,
a defaulting auction winner (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a winner who fails to remit the required down payment within the prescribed time, fails to pay for a license, or is otherwise
disqualified) will be assessed an additional penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent
of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;&sect;1.2104(g) and 1.2109. The additional three percent penalty is designed to encourage bidders
who wish to withdraw their bids to do so before bidding ceases. We will hold deposits made by defaulting or disqualified
auction winners until full payment of the penalty.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that these penalties will adequately discourage default and ensure that bidders have adequate financing
and that they meet all eligibility and qualification requirements. As we explained in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we further believe that this approach is well within our authority under both Section 309(j)(4)(B) and Section 4(i)
of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. &sect;154(i), as it is clearly necessary to carry out the rapid deployment of
new technologies through the use of auctions.

If a license is re-offered by auction, the ``winning bid'' refers to the high bid in the auction in which the license
is re-offered. If a license is re-offered in the same auction, the winning bid refers to the high bid amount, made subsequent
to the withdrawal, in that auction. If the subsequent high bidder also withdraws its bid, that bidder will be required
to pay a penalty equal to the difference between its withdrawn bid and the amount of the subsequent winning bid the next
time the license is offered by the Commission. If a license which is the subject of withdrawal or default is not re-auctioned,
but is instead offered to the highest losing bidders in the initial auction, the ``winning bid'' refers to the bid of
the highest bidder who accepts the offer. Losing bidders would not be required to accept the offer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, they may decline without penalty. We wish to encourage losing bidders in simultaneous multiple round auctions to
bid on other licenses, and therefore we will not hold them to their losing bids on a license for which a bidder has withdrawn
a bid or on which a bidder has defaulted.

77. In addition, if a default or disqualification involves gross misconduct, misrepresentation or bad faith by an
applicant, the Commission may declare the applicant and its principals ineligible to bid in future auctions, and
may take any other action that it deems necessary, including institution of proceedings to revoke any existing licenses
held by the applicant.

3. Re-Offering Licenses When Auction Winners Default

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
78. In the event that an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified, the Commission must determine whether
to hold a new auction or simply offer the license to the second-highest bidder. Parties commenting on this issue generally
favored re-auctioning the license, pointing out that changing market and even technological developments since
the initial auction may change the amounts that bidders are willing to pay for a license, especially if the intervening
period is relatively long. They urge that any re-auction be open to new bidders, arguing that such a procedure would
reduce the incentive of losing bidders to file unmeritorious petitions to deny against the auction winner. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
comments of BellSouth at 37, Utilities Telecommunications Council at 21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we believe that, as a general rule, when an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified after having made
the required down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;204. Although we recognize that this may cause a brief delay in the initiation of service to the public, during
the time between the original auction and the disqualification circumstances may have changed so significantly
as to alter the value of the license to auction participants as well as to parties who did not participate. In this situation,
awarding licenses to the parties that value them most highly can best be assured through a re-auction. However, if
the default occurs within five (5) business days after the bidding has closed, the Commission retains the discretion
to offer the license to the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer
the license to other bidders (in descending order of their bid amounts) at the final bid levels.

If only a small number of relatively low-value licenses are to be re-auctioned and only a short time has passed since
the initial auction, the Commission may choose to offer the license to the highest losing bidders because the cost
of running another auction may exceed the benefits.

80. If a new auction becomes necessary because of default or disqualification more than five (5) business days after
bidding has ended, the Commission will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications. One of our primary
goals in conducting auctions is to assure that all serious interested bidders are in the pool of qualified bidders
at any re-auction. We believe that allowing new applications will promote achievement of this goal, which outweighs
the short delay that we recognize may result from allowing new applications in a re-auction. Indeed, if we were not
to allow new applicants in a re-auction, interested parties might be forced into an after-market transaction to obtain
the license, which would itself delay service to the public and may prevent the public from recovering a reasonable
portion of the value of the spectrum resource.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
81. If the winning bidder makes the down payment in a timely manner, a long-form application filed on FCC Form 401 (as
modified), or such other form as may be adopted for Commercial Mobile Radio Service use in GEN Docket No. 93&hyph;252,
will be required to be filed by a date specified by Public Notice, generally within ten (10) business days after the
close of bidding.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 After the Commission receives the winning bidder's down payment and the long-form application, we will review the
long-form application to determine if it is acceptable for filing. In addition to the information required in the
long-form application of all winning bidders, each winning bidder on licenses in frequency blocks C and F will be required
to submit evidence of its eligibility to bid on licenses in these blocks, as well as evidence to support its claim to
any special provisions made available to designated entities. This information may be included in an exhibit to FCC
Form 401, and must include the gross revenues and total assets of the applicant and all attributable investors in the
applicant, and a certification that the personal net worth of each individual investor does not exceed the eligibility
limitation. This information will enable the Commission, and other interested parties, to ensure the validity of
the applicant's certification of eligibility to bid in blocks C and F (submitted as part of its FCC Form 175) and its
eligibility for any bidding credits, installment payment options, or other special provision. Upon acceptance
for filing of the long-form application, the Commission will issue a Public Notice announcing this fact, triggering
the filing window for petitions to deny. If the Commission denies all petitions to deny, and is otherwise satisfied
that the applicant is qualified, the license(s) will be granted to the auction winner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
82. In the Notice, we proposed to adopt general processing and procedural rules for broadband PCS based on Part 22 of
the Commission's Rules. One commenter, AIDE, argues that the Commission's reference to proposed PCS rules is vague
and legally insufficient for a Notice of Proposed Rule Making. Comments of AIDE at 16&hyph;17. AIDE also asserts that
the adoption of PCS processing and procedural rules is beyond the scope of the Notice in this rule making proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The Notice sought comment on specific rule sections contained in Part 22 of our Rules and asked commenters
to indicate what modifications should be made to those rules to adapt them for PCS services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice at &para;128. In addition, the Notice specifically requested comment on the general procedural, processing
and petition to deny procedures that should be used for auctionable services. The Notice's proposal to adopt processing
rules based on Part 22 of the Commission's Rules, with any appropriate modifications for PCS services, clearly indicated
to commenters the terms of the proposed rules, as is required by 5 U.S.C. &sect;553 and 47 CFR &sect;1.413(c). Accordingly,
we believe that the Notice's description of the proposed rules was sufficiently specific to alert interested parties
to the substance of our proposal and to provide an adequate opportunity for comment on those proposals. Moreover,
we conclude that these issues are well within the scope of the Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83. As we proposed, we adopt for broadband PCS a modified version of the application processing rules contained in
Part 22 of the Commission's Rules. These rules, which will comprise Subpart I of Part 24 of our Rules, will govern application
filing and content requirements, waiver procedures for return of defective applications, regulations regarding
modification of applications, and general application processing rules. We also adopt petition to deny procedures
based on Section 22.30 of the Commission's Rules. In addition, as we proposed in the Notice, we adopt rules similar
to Sections 22.927, 22.928 and 22.929 of our existing rules (47 CFR &sect;&sect;22.927, 22.928, 22.929) to prevent
the filing of speculative applications and pleadings (or threats of the same) designed to extract money from sincere
broadband PCS applicants. In this regard, we limit the consideration that an applicant or petitioner is permitted
to receive for agreeing to withdraw an application or a petition to deny to the legitimate and prudent expenses of the
withdrawing applicant or petitioner.

will incorporate these principles into our broadband PCS procedural rules.

86. If we decide to employ a sequential auction design (using either oral or electronic bid submission), the same general
rules and procedures described above will be used with certain modifications to fit the oral or electronic auction
format. In the case of oral auctions, bidders would be required to follow the procedures described above, including
the submission of the standard upfront payment of $0.02 per MHz-pop prior to the auction. Applicants would submit
a sufficient upfront payment to cover the total number of MHz-pops they desire to win. Once a bidder has won the maximum
number of MHz-pops covered by its upfront payment, that bidder will be precluded from further bidding in the auction.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Immediately after bidding closes on a license, the winning bidder (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the high bidder on a license on which bidding has closed) will be asked to sign a bid confirmation form. No other license
will be put up for bid until a bid confirmation form is signed by a high bidder on the previous license.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Because we recognize that in an oral auction the chances of a bidder accidentally placing a high bid are greater than
in other auction methods, and because the harm will be limited if the license is immediately re-offered, we will not
impose a penalty on a high bidder who withdraws a high bid by refusing to sign the bid confirmation form. Thus, in an sequential
oral auction in which a high bidder declines to sign the bid confirmation form, the license will be immediately put
up for bid again. If, however, a high bidder signs a bid confirmation form but subsequently fails to submit the 20 percent
down payment or otherwise defaults, the standard default penalties (described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

87. If we decide to use sequential electronic bidding, bidders would again follow the general procedures described
above including the submission of the standard upfront payment amount of $0.02 per MHz per pop prior to the auction.
Applicants would submit a sufficient upfront payment to cover the total number of MHz-pops they desire to win. An applicant
will not be eligible to bid on a license for which it has not applied or which contains more MHz-pops than the total MHz-pops
covered by the bidder's upfront payment less any MHz-pops already won by that bidder. Once a bidder has won licenses
representing the maximum number of MHz-pops reflected in its upfront payment, that bidder will be precluded from
further bidding in the auction. Each bidder's eligibility will be computed and tracked by the auction software and
bids placed by ineligible bidders will not be accepted. After the auctioneer declares bidding on a license closed
and the high bidder has been notified, that bidder will be asked to confirm its high bid. If the high bidder in a sequential
electronic auction declines to confirm its high bid, the license will be immediately re-auctioned and no penalty
will be imposed. No other licenses will be put up for bid until a bid confirmation form is signed by a high bidder on the
previous license.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
88. In Section 309(j), Congress directed the Commission to ``require such transfer disclosures and anti-trafficking
restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed
to issue licenses and permits.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(E). In the Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission adopted safeguards designed to ensure that the requirements of Section 309(j)(4)(E) are satisfied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

See Second Report and Order

89. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(at &para;214), we stated our belief that it is important to monitor transfers of licenses awarded by competitive
bidding in order to accumulate the data necessary to evaluate our auction designs and to judge whether ``licenses
[have been] issued for bids that fall short of the true market value of the license.'' H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111 at
257. Therefore, we imposed a transfer disclosure requirement on licenses obtained through the competitive bidding
process, whether by a designated entity or not. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47 CFR &sect;1.2111(a). We believe that the transfer disclosure requirements contained in Section 1.2111(a) of
the Commission's Rules should apply to all broadband PCS licenses obtained through the competitive bidding process.
Generally, licensees transferring their licenses within three years after the initial license grant will be required
to file, together with their transfer applications, the associated contracts for sale, option agreements, management
agreements, and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received in return for the transfer of its
license. As we indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we will give particular scrutiny to auction winners who have not yet begun commercial service and who seek approval
for a transfer of control or assignment of their licenses within three years after the initial license grant, in order
to determine if any unforeseen problems relating to unjust enrichment have arisen outside the designated entity
context.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
90. The Budget Act requires the Commission to ``include performance requirements, such as appropriate deadlines
and penalties for performance failures, to ensure prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to prevent stockpiling
or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or permittees, and to promote investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies
and services.''
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we decided that it was unnecessary and undesirable to impose additional performance requirements, beyond those
already provided in the service rules, for all auctionable services. The broadband PCS service rules already contain
specific performance requirements, such as the requirement to construct within a specified period of time. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;24.203. Failure to satisfy these construction requirements will result in forfeiture of the license.
Accordingly, we do not see the need to adopt any additional performance requirements in this Report and Order.

C. Rules Prohibiting Collusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
91. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we adopted a special rule prohibiting collusive conduct in the context of competitive bidding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;1.2105(c). We referred to the Notice, wherein we indicated our belief that such a rule would serve the
objectives of the Budget Act by preventing parties, especially the largest firms, from agreeing in advance to bidding
strategies that divide the market according to their strategic interests and disadvantage other bidders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;221. We believe that this rule is nowhere more necessary than with respect to broadband PCS auctions, where
we expect bidder interest to be high and the incentives to collude to be great. Thus, Section 1.2105(c) will apply to
broadband PCS auctions. This rule provides that from the time the short-form applications are filed until the winning
bidder has made its required down payment, all bidders will be prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing
or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies with other bidders, unless such bidders
are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application.
In addition, as discussed in Section IV, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidders will be required by Section 1.2105(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules to identify on their Form 175 applications
all parties with whom they have entered into any consortium arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships or other
agreements or understandings which relate to the competitive bidding process. Bidders will also be required to certify
that they have not entered and will not enter into any explicit or implicit agreements, arrangements or understandings
with any parties, other than those identified, regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular
properties on which they will or will not bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92. Winning bidders in broadband PCS auctions will also be subject to Section 1.2107 of the Commission's Rules, which
among other things requires each winning bidder to attach as an exhibit to the Form 401 long-form application a detailed
explanation of the terms and conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortium, joint venture, partnership,
or other agreement or arrangement they had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the close
of bidding. All such arrangements must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications. In addition,
where specific instances of collusion in the competitive bidding process are alleged during the petition to deny
process, the Commission may conduct an investigation or refer such complaints to the United States Department of
Justice for investigation. Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in
connection with participation in the auction process may be subject to forfeiture of their down payment or their full
bid amount and revocation of their license(s), and they may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview and Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93. Congress mandated that the Commission ``ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(D). To achieve this goal, the statute requires the Commission to ``consider
the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' Thus, while providing that we charge for
licenses, Congress has ordered that the Commission design its auction procedures to ensure that designated entities
have opportunities to obtain licenses and provide service. For that purpose, the law does not mandate the use of any
particular procedure, but it specifically approves the use of ``tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other
procedures.'' The use of any such procedure is, in our view, mandated where necessary to achieve Congress's objective
of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94. In addition to this mandate, the statute sets forth various congressional objectives. For example, it provides
that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies the Commission shall ``promot[e] economic
opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American
people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,
including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. &sect;309(j)(4)(C) (requiring the Commission when prescribing area designations and bandwidth assignments,
to promote ``economic opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women).
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Further, Section 309(j)(4)(A) provides that to promote the statute's objectives the Commission shall ``consider
alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments,
with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods *&blank;*&blank;* and combinations of such schedules
and methods.''

64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the Second Report and Order, the statute also requires the Commission to promote the purposes specified
in Section 1 of the Communications Act, which include, among other things, ``to make available, so far as possible,
to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication
service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;151; Second Report and Order at n. 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
95. To satisfy these statutory mandates and objectives, we established in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligibility criteria and general rules that would govern the special measures for small businesses, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. We also identified several measures, including
installment payments, spectrum set-asides, bidding credits and tax certificates, that we could choose from in establishing
rules for auctionable spectrum-based services. We stated that we would decide whether and how to use these special
provisions, or others, when we developed specific competitive bidding rules for particular services. In addition,
we set forth rules designed to prevent unjust enrichment by designated entities who transfer ownership in licenses
obtained through the use of these special measures or who otherwise lose their designated entity status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
96. We intend in the new broadband personal communications service to meet fully the statutory mandate of Section
309(j)(4)(D), as well as the objectives of promoting economic opportunity and competition, of avoiding excessive
concentration of licenses, and of ensuring access to new and innovative technologies by disseminating licenses
among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned
by members of minority groups and women. As explained more fully in this Order, in some respects it is necessary to do
more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate
in the provision of personal communications services than is necessary to ensure participation by other designated
entities. In particular, we have concluded that steps such as adoption of bidding credits, tax certificates, alternate
payment plans and relaxed attribution rules, must be taken to encourage investment in minority and women-owned businesses.
These special provisions are tailored to address the major problem facing minorities and women desiring to offer
PCS_lack of access to capital. Moreover, because broadband PCS licenses in many cases are expected to be auctioned
for large sums of money in the competitive bidding process, and because buildout costs are likely to be high, it is necessary
to do more to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS than is necessary
in other, less costly spectrum-based services. In our view, these steps and the others we adopt are required to fulfill
Congress' mandate that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. The measures
we adopt today will also increase the likelihood that designated entities who win licenses in the auctions become
strong competitors in the provision of broadband PCS service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
97. In instructing the Commission to ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and
spectrum-based services, Congress was well aware of the difficulties these groups encounter in accessing capital.
Indeed, less than two years ago, Congress made specific findings in the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity
Enhancement Act of 1992, that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets
than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.''
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 Because of these problems, Congress resolved to consider carefully legislation and regulations ``to ensure that
small business concerns are not negatively impacted'' and to give priority to passage of ``legislation and regulations
that enhance the viability of small business concerns.''

98. Congress also recognized that these funding problems are even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses,
who face discrimination in the private lending market. For example, Congress explicitly found that businesses owned
by minorities and women have particular difficulties in obtaining capital and that problems encountered by minorities
in this regard are ``extraordinary.''
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 A number of studies also amply support the existence of widespread discrimination against minorities in lending
practices. In October 1992, the year prior to passage of the auction law, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released
an important and highly-publicized study demonstrating that a black or Hispanic applicant in the Boston area is roughly
60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than a similarly situated white applicant.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 The researchers measured every variable mentioned as important in numerous conversations with lenders, underwriters,
and examiners and found that minority applicants are more likely to be denied mortgages even where they have the same
obligation ratios, credit history, loan to value and property characteristics as white applicants. The lending
discrimination that occurs, the study found, does not involve the application of specific rules, but instead occurs
where discretionary decisions are made. Based on the Boston study, it is reasonable to expect that race would affect
business loans that are based on more subjective criteria to an even greater extent than the mortgage loan process,
which uses more standard rules.

99. Importantly, the Boston study also found that, because most loan applicants have some negative attributes, most
loan denials will appear legitimate by some objective standard. Accordingly, the study stated, the lending discrimination
that occurs is very difficult to document at the institution level, so legal remedies may be largely ineffective.
Indeed, Congress had already attempted to address discriminatory lending practices through laws that bar discrimination
in lending, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, enacted in 1974 and amended many times since then. Congress,
therefore, could reasonably assume, based on the Boston study, and its legislative experience regarding discriminatory
lending practices, that minority applicants for licenses issued in spectrum auctions would face substantial (albeit
subtle) barriers to obtaining financing. Any legal remedies, even if effective, would, moreover, come too late to
ensure that minorities are able to participate in spectrum auctions and obtain licenses.

100. Similar evidence presented in testimony before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee on May 20, 1994 indicates
that African American business borrowers have difficulty raising capital mainly because they have less equity to
invest, they receive fewer loan dollars per dollar of equity investment, and they are less likely to have alternate
loan sources, such as affluent family or friends. Assuming two hypothetical college educated, similarly-situated
male entrepreneurs, one black, one white, the testimony indicated that the white candidate would have access to $1.85
in bank loans for each dollar of owner equity invested, while the black candidate would have access to only $1.16. According
to the testimony, the problems associated with lower incomes and intergenerational wealth, as well as the discriminatory
treatment minorities receive from financial institutions, make it much more likely that minorities will be shut
out of capital intensive industries, such as telecommunications. This testimony also noted that African American
representation in communications is so low that it was not possible to generate meaningful summary statistics on
underrepresentation.

101. The inability to access capital is also a major impediment to the successful participation of women in broadband
PCS auctions. In enacting the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, Congress made findings that women, as a group,
are subject to discrimination that adversely affects their ability to raise or secure capital.
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 As AWRT documents, these discriminatory barriers still exist today. Indeed, AWRT reports that while venture capital
is an important source of funding for telecommunications companies, women-owned companies received only approximately
one percent of the $3 billion invested by institutional venture capitalists in 1993. Citing a 1992 National Women's
Business Council report, AWRT further argues that even successful women-owned companies did not overcome these
financing obstacles after they had reached a level of funding and profitability adequate for most other businesses.

102. A study prepared in 1993 by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) further illustrates the
barriers faced by women-owned businesses. For example, it finds that women-owned firms are 22 percent more likely
to report problems dealing with their banks than are businesses at large. In addition, the NFWBO study finds that the
largest single type of short-term financing used by women business owners is credit cards and that over half of women-owned
firms use credit cards for such purposes, as compared to 18 percent of all small to medium-sized businesses, which
generally use bank loans and vendor credit for short-term credit needs. With regard to long-term financing, the study
states that a greater proportion of women-owned firms are turning, or are forced to turn, to private sources, and to
a wider variety of sources, to fulfill their needs. Based on these findings, the NFWBO study concludes that removal
of financial barriers would encourage stronger growth among women-owned businesses, resulting in much greater
growth throughout the economy.

103. If we are to meet the congressional goals of promoting economic opportunity and competition by disseminating
licenses among a wide variety of providers, we must find ways to counteract these barriers to entry. Over the years,
both Congress and the Commission have tried various methods to enhance access to the broadcast and cable industries
by minorities and women. For example, in the late 1960s, the FCC began to promote nondiscriminatory employment policies
by broadcast licensees. These equal employment opportunity efforts have taken the form of Commission rules and policies
that require licensees not to discriminate, to report hiring and promotion statistics, and to implement affirmative
action programs.
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also has adopted similar equal employment rules for licensees in the common carrier, public mobile,
and international fixed public radio communication services,
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 as well for cable operators.
<FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>
 The cable EEO rules were recently revised as part of the implementation of the Cable Act of 1992, and they now apply to
cable entities, satellite master antenna television operators serving 50 or more subscribers and any multichannel
video programming distributor.

104. A decade after it first addressed discriminatory hiring practices, the Commission began to look into the serious
underrepresentation of minorities among owners of broadcast stations. Recognizing that it could play an important
role in alleviating this problem through the licensing process, the Commission adopted its tax certificate and distress
sale policies in 1978 to encourage minority ownership of broadcast facilities.
<FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>
 It noted that full minority participation in the ownership and management of broadcast facilities would result in
a more diverse selection of programming and would inevitably enhance the diversity of control of a valuable resource,

105. In implementing these ownership policies, the Commission identified lack of access to capital as one of the principal
barriers to minority entry. Thus, in 1981, the Commission created the Advisory Committee on Alternative Financing
for Minority Opportunities in Telecommunications (the ``Rivera Committee'') to investigate financing methods
and to give recommendations to the FCC on ways to encourage minority ownership of telecommunications facilities.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 The Rivera Committee confirmed that the shortage of capital is a principal problem facing minorities seeking ownership
opportunities and further found that this shortage was due to minority inexperience in obtaining financial institution
misconceptions about potential minority borrowers, and marketplace structural problems, such as high interest
rates and low broadcast industry earnings growth. Among other things, the Rivera Committee suggested educational
and outreach programs and expanding the tax certificate program to nonbroadcast properties such as common carrier
and land mobile. In response to this recommendation, the FCC submitted draft legislation to Congress proposing to
broaden the scope of the Commission's authority to issue tax certificates in connection with the sale or exchange
of any type of telecommunications facilities.
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 On March 24, 1983, The Minority Telecommunications Ownership Tax Act of 1983, H.R. 2331, which incorporated the Commission's
proposals, was introduced in the House of Representatives.

106. Congress also took steps to address the problem of minority underrepresentation in communications. In 1982,
it mandated the grant of a ``significant preference'' to minority applicants participating in lotteries for spectrum-based
services. 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(i)(3)(A). And, in 1988 and each fiscal year thereafter, Congress attached a provision
to the FCC appropriations legislation, which precluded the Commission from spending any appropriated funds to examine
or change its minority broadcast preference policies.

107. These efforts have met with limited success. The record shows that women and minorities have not gained substantial
ownership representation in either the broadcast or non-broadcast telecommunications industries. For example,
a 1993 report conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) Minority Telecommunications
Development Program shows that, as of August 1993, only 2.7 percent of commercial broadcast stations were owned by
minorities. Another study commissioned by the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency in 1991
found that only one half of one percent of the telecommunications firms in the country were minority owned. The study
also identified only 15 minority cable operators and 11 minority firms engaged in the delivery of cellular, specialized
mobile radio, radio paging or messaging services in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 And, according to the last available U.S. Census, only 24 percent of the communications firms in the country were owned
by women, and these women-owned firms generated only approximately 8.7 percent of the revenues earned by communications
companies.
<FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>
 When companies without paid employees are removed from the equation, firms with women owners represent only 14.5
percent of the communications companies in the country.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 One result of these low numbers is that there are very few minority or women-owned businesses that bring experience
or infrastructure to PCS. They thus face an additional barrier relative to many existing service providers.

109. Congress directed the Commission to ensure that, together with other designated entities, rural telephone
companies have the opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. Rural areas, because of their more dispersed
populations, tend to be less profitable to serve than more densely populated urban areas. Therefore, service to these
areas may not be a priority for many PCS licensees. Rural telephone companies, however, are well positioned because
of their existing infrastructure to serve these areas profitably. We, therefore, have adopted special provisions
to encourage their participation, increasing the likelihood of rapid introduction of service to rural areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110. In the new auction law, Congress directed the Commission to remedy this serious imbalance in the participation
by certain groups, especially minorities and women. The record indicates that, in the absence of meaningful efforts
to assist designated entities, there would be good reason to think that participation by these groups, particularly
businesses owned by women and minorities, would continue to be severely limited. Indeed, the auction law itself envisions
a process that requires payment of funds to acquire an initial license, unlike existing licensing methods such as
comparative hearings or lotteries. It is therefore possible that participation by those with limited access to capital
could be further diminished by operation of the statute, absent affirmative provisions to create competitive opportunity
for designated entities. The measures we adopt in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
thus will carry out Congress's directive to provide meaningful opportunities for small entities, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities to provide broadband PCS services. The rules also are expressly
designed to address the funding problems that face these groups and that are their principal barriers to entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
111. We also intend that designated entities who win licenses have the opportunity to become strong competitors in
this service. While the new broadband PCS service presents tremendous opportunities for designated entities to
participate in the provision of the next generation of innovative wireless mobile telecommunications services,
it is expected to be a highly competitive service, and the estimated costs of acquiring a license and constructing
facilities are substantial. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which was adopted June 9, 1994, we took specific steps to assist designated entities to become viable competitors
in the provision of broadband PCS. For example, we modified the PCS spectrum allocation plan by shifting all channels
blocks to a contiguous lower segment of the ``emerging technologies band'' in part to bolster the ability of designated
entities to obtain more competitively viable licenses. In addition, we relaxed some of the ownership and attribution
rules with respect to cellular operators' participation in PCS to foster investment in designated entity ventures,
<FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>
 and we also relaxed the PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule for designated entities with cellular holdings to allow
them to further expand their opportunities in broadband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>88</FOOTCITE>
 Further, we took steps that will result in lower capital costs for designated entities that obtain PCS licenses, including
adoption of a band plan that will reduce the costs of clearing the PCS spectrum of incumbent microwave users as well
as relaxing the construction requirements.

businesses, small businesses, and businesses owned by women and minorities to raise capital by attracting passive
equity investors. At the same time, we have designed these rules to ensure that the special provisions adopted for
such businesses accrue to the intended beneficiaries.

113. As discussed more fully below, many commenters in this proceeding believe that the inability of designated entities
to obtain adequate funding has a profoundly adverse effect on the potential for these businesses to bid successfully
in auctions against very large, established businesses. Therefore, we take a number of steps in this Order to help
address this imbalance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We establish two ``entrepreneurs' blocks'' (frequency blocks C and F) in which large companies (those with
$125 million or more in annual gross revenues or $500 million or more in total assets) will be prohibited from bidding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Bidding credits will be granted both to small businesses and to businesses owned by women and minorities in
the entrepreneurs' blocks to provide them with a better opportunity to compete successfully in broadband PCS auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Certain winning bidders in frequency blocks C and F will be permitted to pay the license price in installments,
and the interest rate and moratorium on principal payments will be adjusted to assist small businesses and women and
minority-owned businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We adopt a tax certificate program for minority and women-owned businesses, which will provide additional
assistance in their efforts to attract equity investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Rural telephone companies will be allowed to obtain broadband PCS licenses that are geographically partitioned
from larger PCS service areas to provide them more flexibility to serve rural subscribers.

In a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this docket, we will seek comment on whether a partitioning option for
small businesses or businesses owned by women or minorities, as suggested by some of the commenters, may be appropriate.
In that Further Notice, we also will seek comment or whether the Commission should impose a restriction on the assignment
or transfer of control of partitioned licenses by rural telephone companies or other designated entities for some

The gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of certain investors are not considered so long as the applicant
has a `'control group'' consisting of one or more individuals or entities that control the applicant, hold at least
25 percent of the equity and, for corporations, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.

117. We also have imposed numerous strict requirements to deter shams and fronts and to prevent abuse of the incentives
for designated entities. The Commission intends to enforce vigorously each of these requirements. All licensees
in the entrepreneurs' blocks are prohibited from voluntarily assigning or transferring their licenses for three
years after grant of the application and for the next two years may assign or transfer licenses only to other entities
that satisfy the financial criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Furthermore, a business that seeks to acquire
a license from an entity paying in installments during the license period will be required, as a condition of the grant,
to pay according to the installment payment terms for which it qualifies, unless they are more favorable in which case
the existing terms apply. If the purchaser is not qualified for any installment payment plan, we will require payment
of the unpaid balance in full before the sale will be approved. We also adopt rules to ensure that the value of the bidding
credit is returned to the government in the event of a transfer of control or assignment of the license to an entity not
qualifying for bidding credits or not qualifying for as high a bidding credit as the seller. In addition, we impose
a one-year holding period on licenses received through the benefit of a tax certificate. We will also random audits
to ensure that designated entities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 control. These steps and our eligibility and affiliation rules will help to ensure that the measures we adopt are utilized

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligible entities and to deter winning bidders seeking only to make a quick profit on the sale of PCS licenses. Ultimately,
we believe that we will best fulfill our statutory mandate by creating powerful incentives for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of service, and be requiring a strict holding period to ensure that the public receives the benefit of this diverse
ownership.

118. As discussed above, because the auction process itself requires additional expenditures of capital to acquire
licenses, this new licensing procedure in many respects holds the potential to erect an additional barrier to entry
that had not existed even under the Act's previous licensing methods, comparative hearings and lotteries. As reflected
in the House Committee Report, Congress was well aware of that possibility and wanted to ensure that competitive bidding
should not exclude smaller entities from obtaining licenses.
<FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>
 The inability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to obtain adequate private financing
creates a serious imbalance between these companies and large businesses in their prospects for competing successfully
in broadband PCS auctions.

119. In addition, commenters contend that, at the outset, a small PCS business and a large local exchange carrier would
value a license very differently. DCR Communications, for example, argues that a local telephone company would have
much lower costs of construction and operation through equipment volume discounts, existing billing, accounting,
order entry and processing, and customer service systems. Furthermore, DCR contends, the telephone company might
decide to use its PCS system simply as an adjunct to a cellular system it owns in a nearby market and market wireless handsets
that operate in both frequencies. DCR concludes that the telephone company could justify paying the higher value
for the license because it has more ready access to capital.

120. This concern is echoed by a number of commenters. NTIA agrees that capital formation is a major barrier to full
participation by small and minority-owned firms, asserting that capital-constrained firms are likely to assign
lower values to PCS licenses than other bidders and are therefore less likely to obtain licenses in an open bidding
market.
<FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>
 Another party, Impulse Telecommunications Corporation, states that ``giants'' can justify huge bids because they
have billions of dollars of capital as well as an existing administrative, billing, operating and marketing infrastructure.
In addition, Impulse asserts that PCS licenses are likely to hold strategic value for large long distance and local
telephone companies, for such purposes as critical wireless access.
<FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, Tri-State Radio Company states that the allocation of substantial amounts of spectrum to services such
as broadband PCS has generated extensive industry expectation and speculation. With the financial stakes so high,
Tri-State argues that designated entities will have little ability to bid successfully against ``communications
behemoths with almost unlimited financial resources.''

121. We agree that small entities stand little chance of acquiring licenses in these broadband auctions if required
to bid against existing large companies, particularly large telephone, cellular and cable television companies.
If one or more of these big firms targets a market for strategic reasons, there is almost no likelihood that it could
be outbid by a small business. In the Notice, we proposed that one means to address such problems would be to set aside
specific spectrum blocks in broadband PCS that would be reserved for bidding purposes to the designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 In this Order, we have decided to adopt a modification of this proposal, which should greatly enhance the ability of
all designated entities to enter auctions and bid successfully for broadband PCS licenses. Specifically, we establish
two entrepreneurs' blocks, C and F, in which eligibility to bid is limited to entities that, together with their affiliates
and certain investors, have gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years and total assets of
less than $500 million. In addition, we will prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one individual
investor in the applicant has $100 million or greater in personal net worth. Together with a reduced upfront payment
requirement, we believe this proposal will encourage smaller entities to enter the auctions for broadband PCS licenses
and will ensure that ``entrepreneurial'' businesses are granted nearly half of all the broadband PCS licenses being
auctioned.

122. NTIA strongly supports this measure, arguing that it ``would be the most direct mechanism for preserving opportunities
for small companies in an auction environment.'' According to NTIA, reserving two entrepreneurs' blocks helps significantly
in satisfying the congressional directive that competitive bidding not result in an increase in concentration in
the telecommunications industries.
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, Columbia PCS contends that establishment of entrepreneurs' blocks ``provides a good balance between
Congress's clear mandate to provide opportunities for designated entities and avoid undue concentration of PCS
licenses on the one hand with the goal of capturing the value of allocated spectrum for the American public on the other.''

123. The $125 million gross revenue/$500 million asset caps have the effect of excluding the large companies that
would easily be able to outbid designated entities and frustrate Congress's goal of disseminating licenses among
a diversity of licensees. At the same time, this restriction does not exclude many firms that, while not large in comparison
with other telecommunications companies, nevertheless are likely to have the financial ability to provide sustained
competition for the PCS licensees on the MTA blocks. For example, the $125 million gross revenue figure corresponds
roughly to the Commission's definition of a Tier 2, or medium-sized, local exchange carrier,
<FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>
 and would include virtually all of the independently owned rural telephone companies. Limiting the personal net
worth of any individual investor or affiliate of the applicant to $100 million will prevent a very wealthy individual
from leveraging his or her personal assets to allow the applicant to circumvent the size limitations of the entrepreneurs'
blocks.

Local exchange carriers are categorized as Tier 1 and Tier 2 companies by applying the criterion that Sections 32.11(a)
and 32.11(e) of the Commission's Rules use to distinguish Class A and Class B companies, respectively. Class A companies
are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of $100 million or more;
Class B companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of less
than $100 million. The initial classification of a company is determined by its lowest annual operating revenues
for the five immediately preceding years. A company's classification is changed when its annual operating revenue
exceeds or is under the $100 million mark in each of five consecutive years. The Commission imposes more relaxed regulatory
requirements on Tier 2 LECs than on Tier 1 LECs.

124. As noted previously, many commenters asked us to reserve spectrum blocks for bidding only by designated entities.
The entrepreneurs' blocks plan adopted herein is similar in concept to the set-aside proposals set forth by the commenters.
Therefore, in determining which of the blocks in each market should constitute the entrepreneurs' blocks, we paid
close attention to the concerns of those who had advocated set-asides in the first instance. Although the broadband
PCS band plan has changed since the Commission first proposed set-asides in the Notice and parties first submitted
their proposals in this docket, the general concerns of these parties about the amount of spectrum and geographic
territory necessary to compete effectively remain pertinent. Moreover, we adopted the revised broadband PCS band
plan in advance of this Order, which afforded interested parties the opportunity to make additional presentations
on designated entity incentives in light of the new band plan.

The Small Business PCS Association asserted, moreover, that implementation of the set-aside proposal would offer
``a major opportunity'' for small businesses, that a 20 MHz block is ``probably ideal'' for development by small entrepreneurs,
and that even a 10 MHz block could sustain a viable PCS System.

The Small Business PCS Association stated that a small business operating in a single BTA service region could effectively
compete with large companies operating in larger service areas. This is so, it contended, mainly because PCS providers
with large service areas would not realize such great economies of scale as many have supposed and because small firms
could counter such advantages by forming buying cooperatives. Comments of Small Business PCS Association at 2&hyph;3.

126. A considerable number of commenters, however, contended that the Commission's proposal to set aside a 20 MHz
block and a 10 MHz block would be inadequate. Telephone Electronics and AWCC asserted, for instance, that a provider
operating with only a 10 MHz or 20 MHz license could not offer a full range of PCS services with quality equivalent to
the like offerings of a provider operating with a 20 MHz license. Unique and AWCC thus argued that PCS licensees in the
set-aside spectrum would consequently be unable to obtain commercial funding on terms as favorable to those available
to operators with 30 MHz licenses. Independent Cellular Network maintained that the competitive disadvantages
of the proposed set-aside channels, due to their lesser bandwidth, could not be obviated through aggregation, because
of the greater transaction costs that would be incurred above those associated with acquisition of a single 30 MHz
license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
127. We believe that designating frequency blocks C and F as entrepreneurs' blocks meets the concerns of most of the
designated entity commenters. Frequency block C provides 30 MHz of spectrum and, thus, satisfies the concerns of
those parties who believe they must have this amount of bandwidth to compete effectively. The MHz block F license,
on the other hand, fulfills the needs of other designated entities who argued in favor of small blocks. Moreover, since
the C and F blocks are adjacent, they can be aggregated efficiently by one or more licensees. This plan also makes available
to eligible bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks 986 licenses, or slightly under 50 percent of all broadband PCS licenses.
Finally, it does not foreclose opportunities for other parties. Bidders ineligible for the entrepreneurs' blocks
will have the opportunity to bid on 99 30 MHz MTA licenses throughout the country, as well as 986 10 MHz BTA licenses nationwide.

Five-Year Holding and Limited Transfer Period

. In establishing the entrepreneurs' blocks, we recognize the congressionally mandated objective will not be served
if parties take advantage of bidding in these blocks and immediately assign or transfer control of the authorizations
to other entities. Such a practice could unjustly enrich the auction winners and would undermine the congressional
goal of giving designated entities the opportunity to provide spectrum-based services. Therefore, we will prohibit
licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily assigning or transferring control of their licenses for
a period of three years from the date of the license grant.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 And, for the next two years of the license term, we will permit the licensee to assign or transfer control of its authorization
only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks entry criteria.
<FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>
 During this five-year period, licensees will continue to be bound by the financial eligibility requirements, as
set forth below.

129. Our goals are to create significant opportunities for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and businesses owned
by minorities and women to compete in auctions for licenses and attract sufficient capital to build-out those licenses
and provide service. We recognize the critical need to attract capital, which requires flexibility. We are very concerned,
however, that such flexibility not undermine our more fundamental objective, which is to ensure that designated
entities retain

 control of their companies at all times. We believe that the five-year holding and limited transfer period, which

longer holding period (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

130. In the Notice, we indicated that we might use spectrum set-asides for designated entities in the broadband PCS
service but did not expressly propose to use bidding credits. For two other services, IVDS and narrowband PCS, however,
we did conclude recently that the use of bidding credits in auctions would be an effective tool to ensure that women
and minority-owned businesses have opportunities to participate in the provision of those services.
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 On further reflection, and based on the many comments in the record favoring this approach, we believe that bidding
credits are necessary to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses and small businesses participate in broadband
PCS. Accordingly, we adopt a bidding credit plan for winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks that gives small
businesses a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned businesses a 15 percent credit, and small businesses owned
by women and minorities an aggregate credit of 25 percent.

131. At the outset, we note that we are confining the bidding credit option to the entrepreneurs' blocks because, given
the extremely capital intensive nature of broadband PCS, we do not think bidding credits in an uninsulated block would
have a meaningful effect.
<FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 presentations to the Commission, many commenters have indicated that, without spectrum set-asides for broadband
PCS, bidding credits would not be sufficient to assist designated entities in outbidding very large entities who
are likely to bid for licenses in this service. DCR Communications states, for example, that all of the existing large
telecommunications carriers can justify must larger payments for licenses than could an individual entrepreneur,
regardless of a bidder's credit. Therefore, it believes no entrepreneur will win a bid for any PCS market that is desirable
to any of the large companies.
<FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>
 Many other commenters echo this concern.
<FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>
 Some state that, if bidding credits alone are used, extraordinarily large credits, even on the order of 50 percent
or more, would be ineffective.
<FOOTCITE>109</FOOTCITE>
 As described above, in order to afford designated entities a realistic opportunity to obtain licenses in the broadband
PCS service, we have taken measures to exclude very large businesses from bidding for licenses in the C and F blocks.
These measures will enhance the value of the bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities
and women. In this context, we believe that bidding credits will have a significant effect on the ability of small businesses
and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate successfully in auctions for licenses in these blocks.

132. As explained above, the capital access problems faced by small firms and women and minority-owned firms make
special provisions like bidding credits appropriate for these designated entities in broadband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>110</FOOTCITE>
 In effect, the bidding credit will function as a discount on the bid price a firm will actually have to pay to obtain a
license and, thus, will address directly the financing obstacles encountered by these entities. Moreover, as noted
previously, women and minorities face discrimination in lending and other barriers to entry not encountered by other
firms, including other designated entities. Therefore, as one of the measures designed to counter these increased
capital formation difficulties, we will provide them with a slightly higher bidding credit than that granted to small
businesses. Thus, women and minorities will receive a 15 percent payment discount that is applied against the amounts
they bid on licenses. Absent such measures targeted specifically to women and minorities, it would be virtually impossible
to assure that these groups achieve any meaningful measure of opportunity for actual participation in the provision
of broadband PCS. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that small firms owned by women and minorities suffer the problems
endemic to both groups and that a cumulative bidding credit of 25 percent is therefore appropriate. We believe that
these measures will help women and minorities to attract the capital necessary for obtaining a license and constructing
and operating a broadband PCS system, consistent with the intent of Congress.

Although we did not grant bidding credits to small businesses in the narrowband PCS or IVDS services, we believe that,
given the exponentially greater expense likely to be incurred in acquiring broadband PCS licenses and construct
the systems, bidding credits are a proper means to ensure that these firms have the opportunity to participate in this
service. We note that for narrowband PCS and IVDS, the cost of license acquisition and implementation of service is
anticipated to be considerably more modest.

133. The definition of a minority or women-owned firm and of a small business are set forth below.
<FOOTCITE>111</FOOTCITE>
 To receive a 10 percent bidding credit, a small business must satisfy a gross revenue test. As explained more fully
below in the small business definition section, a consortium consisting entirely of small businesses also is eligible
for a 10 percent bidding credit even if the combined gross revenues of the consortium exceed the small business gross
revenues threshold. In addition, a small business that is owned by women and minorities must satisfy the definition
of a business owned by minorities and women as well as the small business definition to receive a 25 percent bidding
credit. Finally, a consortium of small firms owned by women and/or minorities is eligible for a 25 percent bidding
credit, provided that each member of the consortium meets the definition of a small business and a minority and/or
women-owned firm.

Unjust Enrichment Applicable to Bidding Credits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To ensure that bidding credits benefit the parties to whom they are directed, we adopt strict repayment penalties.
If, within the original term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that is not eligible
for as a high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding credit obtained by the assigning party
and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify must be paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of
approval of the transfer. For example, an assignment of a license from a small minority-owned firm to a women-owned
firm with revenues greater than $40 million would require repayment of 10 percent of the original bid price (25 percent
less 15 percent) to the Treasury. A sale to an entity that would not qualify for bidding credits will entail full payment
of the bidding credit as a condition of transfer. Small businesses also will be bound by the financial eligibility
rules during the entire license term as set forth below. Thus, if after licensing an investor purchases an ``attributable''
interest in the business and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million small business cap,
this repayment provision will apply.
<FOOTCITE>112</FOOTCITE>
 These repayment provisions apply throughout the original term of the license to help promote the long-term holding
of licenses by those parties receiving bidding credits.

135. A significant barrier for most businesses small enough to qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be
access to adequate private financing to ensure their ability to compete against larger firms in the PCS marketplace.

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we concluded that installment payments are an effective means to address the inability of small businesses to obtain
financing and will enable these entities to compete more effectively for the auctioned spectrum. We also determined
that small businesses eligible for installment payments would only be required to pay half of the down payment (10
percent of the winning bid, as opposed to 20 percent) five days after the auction closes, with the remaining 10 percent
payment deferred until five days after grant of the license. Finally, we indicated that installment payments should
be made available to small businesses at an interest rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations.

136. In light of the expected substantial capital required to acquire and construct broadband PCS licenses, we conclude
that installment payments are an appropriate measure for most businesses that obtain broadband PCS licenses in the
entrepreneurs' blocks. By allowing payment in installments, the government is in effect extending credit to licensees,
thus reducing the amount of private financing needed prior to and after the auction. Such low cost government financing
will promote long-term participation by these businesses, which, because of their smaller size, lack access to sufficient
capital to compete effectively with larger PCS licensees. Under the rules we adopt today, installment payments are
available to small entities that do not technically qualify as small businesses for purposes of other measures we
have adopted, such as bidding credits. We believe, however, that, given the enormous costs of broadband PCS and the
likelihood of very large participants in the other blocks, this option is fully consistent with the congressional
intent in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(A) to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the effect of favoring incumbent
providers of other communications services, with established revenue streams, over smaller entities.

137. Under the plan we adopt here, all licensees that satisfy the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth
criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be allowed to pay in installments for licenses granted in those blocks
in the 50 largest BTAs. In the smaller BTAs, however, only businesses owned by women and minorities and those licensees
with less than $75 million in gross revenues will be able to use installment payments.
<FOOTCITE>115</FOOTCITE>
 This distinction is based on the expected lower costs to acquire licenses and construct systems in the smaller BTAs.
Thus, with the exception of companies owned by women or minorities, which face additional problems accessing capital,
we do not think that a firm with gross revenues exceeding $75 million will require government financing to be competitive
in the small BTAs.

We will apply the same $500 million total assets and $100 million personal net worth standards for purposes of determining

138. The installment payment option will enable qualified businesses to pay their winning bid over time. These businesses
must make the applicable upfront payment in full before the auction, but are required to make a post-auction down payment
equaling only ten percent of their winning bids, half of which will be due five business days after the auction closes.
Payment of the other half of the down payment will be deferred until five business days after the license is granted.
In general, the remaining 90 percent of the auction price will be paid in installments with interest charges to be fixed
at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5 percent. Under this
general rule, only payments of interest will be due for the first year with principal and interest payments amortized
over the remaining nine years of the license. Timely payment of all installments will be a condition of the license
grant and failure to make sure timely payment will be grounds for revocation of the license.

Enhanced Installment Payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As explained previously, small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women face capital access difficulties
not encountered by other firms and, thus, require special measures to ensure their opportunity to participate in
broadband PCS. Accordingly, we will provide an ``enhanced'' installment payment plan for these entities. Pursuant
to this enhanced installment payment plan, small businesses (as defined below) who win licenses in the entrepreneurs'
blocks will be required to pay interest only for the first two years of the license term at the same interest rate as set
forth in the general rule. Businesses owned by women and/or minorities will be able to make interest-only payments
for three years. Interest will accrue at the Treasury note rate without the additional 2.5 percent.
<FOOTCITE>118</FOOTCITE>
 And, finally, businesses that are both small and owned by women and/or minorities will be required to pay only interest
for five years. Interest will accrue at the Treasury note rate.

To be eligible for these ``enhanced'' installment payments, a firm must satisfy either of the two alternative definitions
of a woman or minority-owned business, as set forth in &para;&para; 181&hyph;192, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

140. These enhanced installment payments are narrowly tailored to the needs of the various designated entities,
as reflected in the record in this proceeding. We believe that varying the moratorium on principal in the early years
of the loan and varying the interest rate based on these needs will allow small businesses and companies owned by women
and/or minorities to bid higher in auctions, thereby increasing their changes for obtaining licenses. In addition,
it will allow them to concentrate their resources on infrastructure build-out and, therefore, it will increase the
likelihood that they become viable PCS competitors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unjust Enrichment Applicable to Installment Payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of measures meant for smaller firms,
we will use the unjust enrichment provisions adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to installment payments. Specifically, if a licensee that was awarded installment payments seeks to
assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the applicable eligibility standards set out above
during the term of the license, we will require payment of the remaining principal and any interest accrued through
the date of assignment as a condition of the license assignment or transfer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 263; 47 CFR 1.2111(c). Moreover, if an entity seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity
that does not qualify for as favorable an installment payment plan, the installment payment plan, if any, for which
the acquiring entity qualifies will become effective immediately upon transfer. Thus, a higher interest rate and
earlier payment of principal may begin to be applied. For example, a transfer of a license in the fourth year after license
grant from a small minority-owned firm to a small non-minority owned firm would require that the firm begin principal
payments and the balance would begin accruing interest at a rate 2.5 percent above the rate that had been in effect.
<FOOTCITE>119</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, if an investor subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the businesses and, as a result,
the gross revenues or total assets of the business exceed the applicable financial caps, this unjust enrichment provision
will also apply.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
We recognize that because of the five-year holding and limited transfer requirements in the entrepreneurs' blocks,
these unjust enrichment provisions have limited applicability during the first five years of the license term. Nevertheless,
there are some situations in which licensees are permitted to assign or transfer their licenses during this period
and the provisions would then apply if the buyer would not have been qualified for installment payments or as favorable
an installment payment plan. Furthermore, the unjust enrichment provisions are applicable for the full ten-year
license term.

G. Tax Certificates

142. Congress instructed the Commission to consider the use of tax certificates to help ensure designated entity
participation in spectrum-based services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we observed that tax certificates could be useful as a means of attracting investors to designated entity enterprises
and to encourage licensees to assign or transfer control of licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions.
We stated further that we would examine the feasibility of using this measure in subsequent service-specific auction
rules.

143. We believe that tax certificates, which allow the recipients to defer capital gains taxes made on sales, are an
appropriate tool to assist women and minority-owned businesses to attract start-up capital from non-controlling
investors in broadband PCS. As explained above, due to discrimination in private lending markets and other factors,
these designated entities face added obstacles in accessing capital. Therefore, in order to ensure that such businesses
have a meaningful opportunity to participate in auctions, it is necessary to adopt measures to encourage investment
in minority and woman-owned companies. Moreover, because of the severe underrepresentation of women and minorities
in telecommunications, we believe that it is appropriate to give PCS licensees the incentive, through the grant of
tax certificates, to assign or transfer their authorizations to such entities in post-auction sales. This measure
will provide added assurance that minority and women-owned entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband
PCS services, as mandated by Congress. Accordingly, we will issue tax certificates to non-controlling initial investors
in minority and women-owned broadband PCS applicants (in any frequency block), upon the sale of their non-controlling
interests. We will also issue tax certificates to broadband PCS licensees (in any frequency block) who assign or transfer
control of their licenses to minority and women-owned entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
144. We have used tax certificates over the years to encourage broadcast licensees and cable television operators
to transfer their stations and systems to minority buyers.
<FOOTCITE>121</FOOTCITE>
 We also have granted tax certificates to shareholders in minority-controlled broadcast or cable entities who sell
their shares, when such interests were acquired to assist in the financing of the acquisition of the facility.
<FOOTCITE>122</FOOTCITE>
 These broadcast and cable tax certificates are issued pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. &sect;1071.
While Congress' goal in authorizing tax certificates under Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act is somewhat different,
and focuses on ensuring the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and spectrum-based services,
we think that tax certificates will be equally valuable in the broadband PCS context. Issuance of tax certificates
to investors in minority and women-owned businesses and licensees that sell to minorities and women will augment
the other measures we adopt today to encourage minorities and women to participate in broadband PCS and will increase
the ability of these entities to access financing for that purpose.

145. In implementing this program, we will borrow from our existing tax certificate program and grant tax certificates,
upon request, that will enable the licensees and investors meeting the criteria outlined here to defer the gain realized
upon a sale by: (1) Treating it as an involuntary conversion under 26 U.S.C. &sect;1033, with the recognition of gain
avoided by the acquisition of qualified replacement property; or (2) electing to reduce the basis of certain depreciable
property; or both. Tax certificates will be available to initial investors in minority and woman-owned businesses
who provide ``start-up'' financing, which allows these businesses to acquire licenses at auction or in the post-auction
market, and those investors who purchase interests within the first year after license issuance, which allows for
the stabilization of the designated entities' capital base. The definition of a minority or women-owned entity is
set forth below
<FOOTCITE>123</FOOTCITE>
 and, with regard to our investor tax certificate policy, the entity in which the investment is made must satisfy that
definition at the time of the original investment as well as after the investor's shares are sold. For post-auction
market sales, tax certificates will be issued only to licensees who sell to entities that meet that definition. Tax
certificates will be granted only upon completion of the sale, although parties may request a declaratory ruling
from the Commission regarding the tax certificate consequences of prospective transactions.

One-Year Holding Period
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As with our other tax certificate policies, we are concerned about avoiding ``sham'' arrangements to obtain tax
certificates and, pursuant to Section 309(j)(4)(E), thus adopt measures to prevent abuses. As in our existing tax
certificate program,
<FOOTCITE>124</FOOTCITE>
 we will impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer of control or assignment of broadband PCS licenses by
women and minority-owned businesses who obtained such licenses through the benefit of tax certificates. We believe
that the rapid resale of such licenses at a profit would subvert our goal of ensuring the opportunity to participate
by minority or woman-owned businesses. If the buyer itself is a women or minority-owned business, however, our objectives
still will be satisfied. Thus, as an exception to the holding requirement, we will permit the assignment or transfer
of control of licenses during this period to other qualified minority and women-owned businesses. We note, however,
that the assignee or transferee who receives this license before the end of the original one-year holding period will
also be subject to a one-year holding requirement, from the date of consummation of the assignment or transfer.

, we indicated that we would address in this proceeding proposals for issuing tax certificates to cellular operators
who divest their cellular holdings in order to come into compliance with our rules governing cellular operators'
participation in broadband PCS. Several commenters argued that tax certificates should be issued to all such companies
who divest their holdings.
<FOOTCITE>125</FOOTCITE>
 To accomplish the directive in Section 309(j)(4)(D) that minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate
in the provision of spectrum-based services, we have decided to issue tax certificates to such cellular companies
so long as their cellular interests are divested to businesses owned by minorities and/or women, as defined in this
order. In this manner, we can further implement Congress's goal to facilitate the participation of minorities and
women in spectrum-based services. We will also impose a one-year holding period requirement on the assignment or
transfer of control of cellular licenses obtained by women and minority-owned businesses through the benefit of
this tax certificate policy.

at &para;125. This action increases the number of rural telephone companies that will be eligible to hold PCS licenses.
In taking this action, we recognized that their existing infrastructure makes rural telephone companies well suited
to introduce PCS services rapidly into their service areas and adjacent areas. Thus, this action will help speed service
to rural areas, which tend to be less profitable to serve for companies without existing infrastructure than more
densely populated urban areas.

150. We suggested in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that allowing broadband PCS licenses to be geographically partitioned may be a means to permit rural telephone companies
to hold licenses to provide service in their telephone service areas.
<FOOTCITE>126</FOOTCITE>
 Many rural telephone companies proposed some form of partitioning in their comments, arguing that if they were required
to bid on entire BTA or MTA licenses to obtain licenses covering their wireline service areas, they would be effectively
barred from entering the broadband PCS industry. They contend that under a partitioning plan, they would be able to
serve areas in which they already provide service, while the remainder of the PCS service area could be served by other
providers. Such a plan, they argue, would encourage rural telephone companies to take advantage of existing infrastructure
in providing PCS services, thereby speeding service to rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>127</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that these proposals have merit, and therefore we now adopt a license partitioning system to provide these
designated entities the enhanced opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS and to deploy broadband
PCS in their rural services areas rapidly.

151. Our partitioning system will allow rural telephone companies to obtain broadband PCS licenses that are geographically
partitioned from larger PCS service areas. These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS
licenses in either of two ways in any frequency blocks: (1) They may form bidding consortia consisting entirely of
rural telephone companies to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants,
and (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and
agreement either before or after the auction. Each rural telephone company member of a consortium will, following
the auction, be required to file a long-form application for its respective, mutually agreed-upon geographic area.
If rural telephone company consortia are formed to bid on licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks, the eligibility
rules for those blocks will apply (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the cumulative gross revenues and assets of the consortium members may not exceed the financial caps for eligibility
in these blocks).
<FOOTCITE>128</FOOTCITE>
 We will require that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county lines) and
that each area include all portions of the wireline service area of the rural telephone company applicant that lies
within the PCS service area. In addition, if a rural telephone company receives a partitioned license post-auction
from another PCS licensee, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline
service area that lies within the PCS service area.
<FOOTCITE>129</FOOTCITE>
 We recognize that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning the areas in which they will
receive partitioned licenses, so we do not adopt a strict rule concerning the reasonableness of the partitioned area.
Generally, we will presume as reasonable a partitioned area that contains no more than twice the population of that
portion of a rural telephone company's wireline service area that lies within the PCS service area. Each licensee
in each partitioned area will be responsible for meeting the build-out requirements in its area.

&para;&para;179&hyph;180. Therefore, if each member of a consortium of rural telephone companies also satisfies
the definition of a small business, we will allow the consortium to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks even if it exceeds
the gross revenues and total assets caps.

152. Allowing partitioning of rural areas served by rural telephone companies provides a viable opportunity for
many of these designated entities who desire to offer PCS to their customers as a complement to their local telephone
services. For example, rural telephone companies who cannot afford or do not desire to bid for or construct PCS systems
for an entire BTA can thus acquire licenses in areas they wish to serve or form bidding consortia and partition the entire
BTA among themselves. We believe that rural partitioning is an efficient method of getting a license in the hands of
an entity that will provide rapid service to rural areas.

153. We have decided not to adopt any other auction-related measures specifically for rural telephone companies
in this Order. We believe that the partitioning plan we are adopting will provide rural telephone companies with substantial
capabilities to acquire licenses to provide broadband PCS in their rural telephone service areas, consistent with
our statutory mandate. In addition, our eligibility criteria for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks, discussed
below, will permit virtually all telephone companies whose service areas are predominantly rural to bid on licenses
in frequency blocks C and F without competition from the large telephone companies and other deep-pocketed bidders.
Thus, virtually all rural telephone companies will be able to bid for broadband PCS licenses and defer payment in accordance
with the installment payment plans we are adopting for the entrepreneurs' blocks. We also note that if a rural telephone
company meets the definition of a small business or a business owned by minorities and/or women, it would enjoy a bidding
credit and ``enhanced'' installment payments applicable to those groups when bidding on licenses in these blocks.
We do not think that any other measures are necessary in order to satisfy the statute's directive that we ensure that
rural telephone companies have the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and
to satisfy our goals to ensure that PCS is provided to all areas of the country including rural areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
154. Upfront payment requirements are designed to ensure that bidders are qualified and serious and to provide the
Commission with a source of funds in the event that it becomes necessary to assess default or bid withdrawal penalties.
<FOOTCITE>130</FOOTCITE>
 The upfront payment ensures that bids during the course of the auction are

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and convey information about the value of the underlying licenses. Our standard upfront payment for broadband PCS
is $0.02 per MHz per pop, which is equivalent to roughly six percent of the license value, based on an estimate in a Congressional
Budget Office report of the total value of the auctionable spectrum.
<FOOTCITE>131</FOOTCITE>
 A number of commenters assert that the Commission could enhance the opportunity of designated entities to participate
in competitive bidding by reducing the required upfront payment for those applicants.
<FOOTCITE>132</FOOTCITE>
 We agree that the $0.02 per MHz per pop upfront payment requirement might impose a barrier for smaller entities wishing
to participate in the auctions. Moreover, we note that most bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be entitled
to pay for their licenses in installments, which requires a down payment of only five percent of the winning bid. We
are concerned that requiring an upfront payment that may be larger than the down payment that the winning bidder is
required to tender could discourage auction participation.

155. For these reasons, we will reduce the upfront payment requirement to $0.015 per MHz per pop for bidders in the entrepreneurs'
blocks. This 25 percent discount should facilitate auction participation by capital-constrained companies and
permit them to conserve resources for infrastructure development after winning a license. Moreover, since the upfront
payment is still substantial, ranging from slightly below $20,000 for a 30 MHz license in the smallest BTAs to more
than $10 million for the New York BTA, insincere bidding will be discouraged and the Commission will have access to
funds if it must collect default or bid withdrawal penalty payments.

156. As noted previously, eligibility to bid in the two entrepreneurs' blocks, C and F, is limited to companies that,
together with their affiliates and investors, had gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years
and have total assets of less than $500 million at the time their short form applications are filed. In addition, we
will prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one individual investor or principal in the applicant
has $100 million or greater in personal net worth at the short form application filing date.

157. In determining whether an applicant satisfies these financial thresholds, we will count the gross revenues
and total assets of the applicant as well as those of its investors with ``attributable'' interests. The subsection
that follows discusses what interests are attributable for these purposes. In addition, it sets forth exceptions
to these attribution rules for minority and women-owned applicants and for publicly-traded companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualified ``Entrepreneurs''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a general rule, the gross revenues and total assets of all investors in, and affiliates of, an applicant are counted
on a cumulative, fully-diluted basis for purposes of determining whether the $125 million/$500 million thresholds
have been exceeded, and on an individual basis regarding the $100 personal net worth standard.
<FOOTCITE>133</FOOTCITE>
 There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, applicants that meet the definition of a small business may,
as discussed below, form consortia of small businesses that, on an aggregate basis, exceed the gross revenue/total
asset caps. Second, the gross revenues, total assets, personal net worth, and affiliations of any investor in the
applicant are not considered so long as the investor holds less than 25 percent of the applicant's passive equity.
For corporations, we shall use the term passive equity investors to mean investors who hold only non-voting stock
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts of voting stock that include no more than five percent of the voting interests. Where different classes of
stock are held, however, the total amount of equity must still be less than 25 percent to meet this requirement. For
partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the entity.
<FOOTCITE>134</FOOTCITE>
 The passive investor exception will be available, however, only so long as the applicant remains under the control
of one or more entities or individuals (defined as the ``control group'') and the control group holds at least 25 percent
of the applicant's equity and, in the case of corporate applicants, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>135</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must hold all the general partnership interests. Winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications the identity of the members of this control group
and the means of ensuring control (such as a voting trust agreement). The gross revenues, total assets and personal
net worth (if applicable) of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the
$125 million gross revenues/$500 million total assets thresholds or the individual $100 million personal net worth
standard, regardless of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant.

Applicants must be prepared to demonstrate that the limited partners do not have influence over the affairs of the

159. The attribution levels we have selected here are intended to balance the competing considerations that apply
in this particular context and may differ from those we have used in other circumstances. As a general matter, the 25
percent limitation on equity investment interests will serve as a safeguard that the very large entities who are excluded
from bidding in these blocks do not, through their investments in qualified firms, circumvent the gross revenue/total
asset caps. At the same time, it will afford qualified bidders a reasonable measure of flexibility in obtaining needed
financing from other entities, while ensuring that such entities do not acquire controlling interests in the eligible
bidders.
<FOOTCITE>136</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the five percent threshold for attributing revenues of investors with voting stock in corporate applicants
is designed to keep ineligible parties from exerting undue control over eligible firms.
<FOOTCITE>137</FOOTCITE>
 For all of these reasons, we also will attribute the gross revenues and total assets of entities, or the personal net
worth of individuals, that otherwise constitute ``affiliates'' of the applicant.

Qualified Woman and Minority-Owned ``Entrepreneurs''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, the record demonstrates that women and minorities have especially acute problems in obtaining
financing, due in part to discriminatory lending practices by private financial institutions. To address these
special problems and to afford women and minority-owned businesses more flexibility in attracting financing, it
is necessary to provide these entities with an alternative, somewhat more relaxed option regarding the attribution
of revenues of passive investors. Under this alternative standard, we will not attribute to the applicant the gross
revenues, assets, or net worth of any single investor in a minority or woman-owned applicant unless it holds more than
49.9 percent of the passive equity (which is defined to include as much as five percent of a corporation's voting stock).
To guard against abuses, however, the control group of applicants choosing this option would have to own at least 50.1
percent of the applicant's equity, as well as retain control and hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>139</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed above with regard to general eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, winning bidders must identify
on their long-form applications a control group (this time consisting entirely of minorities and/or women or entities
100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) and the gross revenues and net worth of each member of
the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $125 million gross revenue/$500 million
total asset thresholds or the individual $100 million personal net worth limitation, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant.

161. Relaxing the attribution standard somewhat in determining eligibility of women and minority-owned companies
to bid for licenses on frequency blocks C and F directly addresses what most commenters have stated to be the biggest
obstacle to entry for these designated entities: obtaining adequate financing. By this measure, women and minorities
who are eligible to bid in these blocks (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, who otherwise meet the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million total asset standard) will be required to maintain
control of their companies and, at the same time, will have flexibility to attract significant infusions of capital
from a single investor. The requirement that the minority and women principals hold 50.1 percent of the company's
equity mitigates substantially the danger that a well-capitalized investor with a substantial ownership stake
will be able to assume 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant. Because this step gives large companies, who are otherwise ineligible to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, a significant incentive to ``partner'' with minority and women-owned firms, it will enhance the likelihood
that these designated entities will be both successful in the auctions and become viable, long-term competitors
in the PCS industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
162. Of course, women and minority-owned firms, like any other applicant for a C or F block license, may sell a larger
portion of their companies' equity, provided that they also abide by the general eligibility requirements to bid
in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, the gross revenues, total assets and net worth of all investors holding
25 percent or more of the company's passive equity (as defined to include 5 percent or more of the voting stock) will
be attributed toward the $125 million/$500 million caps or the $100 million personal net worth standard. In this event,
the control group will be required to hold at least 25 percent of the company's equity and 50.1 percent of its voting
stock.

We also believe that these attribution rules may impose a particular hardship on publicly traded companies, which

for purposes of determining eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we adopt an exception from these rules
for publicly traded companies.
<FOOTCITE>140</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, we will not attribute the gross revenues or total assets of a shareholder in a publicly traded company
that owns up to 25 percent of the corporation's equity, even if that equity is represented by up to 15 percent of the voting
stock. To take advantage of this exception, however, the eligible control group of the applicant still must control
the corporation, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock, and at least 25 percent of the company's equity.

We note that this exception for publicly held companies is only applicable for purposes of assessing eligibility
to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks and for the general installment payment option. In the event that a publicly traded
company can demonstrate that the 15 percent threshold would impose a serious hardship, the Commission would entertain
a request to raise the threshold in individual cases. Companies seeking such relief must also demonstrate that raising
the threshold would not contravene the Commission's control objectives, as described in this Order. We do not believe,
however, that publicly traded corporations with individual shareholders owning up to 15 percent active equity require
additional special provisions such as bidding credits, ``enhanced'' installment payments, or tax certificates
to overcome capital access problems. Thus, we will not apply this exception with regard to the small business definition
or the definition of a woman or minority-owned business.

 control of the firms that are eligible for special treatment under the rules for broadband PCS. For this purpose, we
shall borrow from certain SBA rules that are used to determine when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of a small business.
<FOOTCITE>142</FOOTCITE>
 These SBA rules, which are codified in 13 CFR 121.401, provide several specific examples of instances in which an entity
might have control of a firm even though the entity has less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, and thus
provide a useful model for our rules. Through reference to circumstances such as those described in the SBA rules,
our rules will expressly alert designated entities that control of the applicant through ownership of 50.1 percent
of the firm's voting interests may be insufficient to ensure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant if, for example, the voting stock of the eligible control group is widely dispersed. In those
and other circumstances, ownership of 50.1 percent of the voting stock may be insufficient to assure control of the
applicant. Of course, apart from these structural issues relative to control, eligible entities must not, during
the license term, abandon control of their licenses through any other mechanism. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

To ensure that the control group has a substantial financial stake in the venture, we shall adopt certain additional
requirements, also borrowed from SBA rules. As noted previously, we shall require that at least 50.1 percent of each
class of voting stock and at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent for the alternative option for minority and women-owned
businesses) of the aggregate of all outstanding shares of stock to be unconditionally owned by the control group members.
In addition, 50.1 percent of the annual distribution of dividends paid on the voting stock of a corporate applicant
concern must be paid to these members. Also, in the event stock is sold, the control group members must be entitled to
receive 100 percent of the value of each share of stock in his or her possession. Similarly, in the event of dissolution
or liquidation of the corporation, the control group members must be entitled to receive at least 25 percent (or 50.1
percent, as the case may be) of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the value of each share of the stock
in his or her possession, subject, of course, to any applicable laws requiring that debt be paid before distribution
of equity.

Application of the Five-Year Holding Rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, we explain how these attribution rules apply with regard to the five-year holding and limited transfer period
for C and F block licensees. During this five-year period, a C or F block licensee must not sell more than 25 percent of
its passive equity to a single investor if the resulting attribution of that investor's gross revenues or total assets
would bring the company over the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million total assets thresholds, or if that investor's
personal net worth exceeds the $100 million personal net worth cap. Similarly, while individual members of the control
group may change (if it would not result in a transfer of control of the company), the control group must maintain control
and at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>144</FOOTCITE>
 A company will be permitted to grow beyond these gross revenues/total assets caps, however, through equity investment
by non-attributable (i.e. passive) investors, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development
or expanded service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial
license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals
exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks or otherwise
circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate cases,
issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress,
that women, minorities and small businesses be given an opportunity to participate in broadband PCS services, not
merely as fronts for other entities, but as active entrepreneurs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
169. The special provisions which we adopt for designated entities are based, in part, on our mandate to fulfill the
congressional goal that we disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants. 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(3)(B).
Therefore, in adopting the financial assistance measures set forth in this Report and Order, we are concerned about
the possibility, even if remote, that a few bidders will win a very large number of the licenses in the entrepreneurs'
blocks. As a consequence, the benefits that Congress intended for designated entities would be enjoyed, in disproportionate
measure, by only a few individuals or entities. Congress, in our view, did not intend that result. We shall therefore
take steps to ensure that the financial assistance provided through our rules is dispersed to a reasonable number
of applicants who win licenses in these blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170. To achieve a fair distribution of the benefits intended by Congress, we shall impose a reasonable limit on the
total number of licenses within the entrepreneurs' blocks that a single entity may win at auction. In setting this
limit, we shall take care not to impose a restriction that would prevent applicants from obtaining a sufficient number
of licenses to create large and efficient regional services. Specifically, we shall impose a limitation that no single
entity may win more than 10 percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs' blocks, or 98 licenses. These licenses
may all be in frequency block C or all in frequency block F, or in some combination of the two blocks. Such a limit will
ensure that at least ten winning bidders enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks. At the same time, it will
allow bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies that include large numbers of licenses and extensive geographic
coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
171. Further, this limitation will apply only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auctions in these blocks;
it is not an ownership cap that applies to licenses that might be obtained after the auctions. For purposes of implementing
this restriction, we shall consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant (or other entity) that controls,
or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to control another license won at the
auction.

definition upward to accommodate capital intensive telecommunications businesses.

The SBA has recently changed its net worth/net income standard as it applies to its Small Business Investment Company
(SBIC) Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
59 Fed. Reg. 16953, 16956 (April 8, 1994). The new standard for determining eligibility for small business concerns
applying for financial and/or management assistance under the SBIC program was increased to $18 million net worth
and $6 million after-tax net income. 15 CFR &sect;121.802(a)(3)(i). The change in this size standard was attributable
to an adjustment for inflation and changes in the SBIC program ``designed to strengthen and expand the capabilities
of SBICs to finance small businesses so that they can increase their contribution to economic growth and job creation.''
59 Fed. Reg. at 16955. However, Section 121.601, which was the SBA size standard cited in the Notice and the Second Report
and Order, has not been modified by the SBA. For purposes of our generic competitive bidding rules, in consultation
with the SBA, we will reexamine our $6 million net worth/$2 million annual profits definition in light of the SBA's
recent action.

173. Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argue that the SBA net worth/net revenue
definition is too restrictive and will exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the
competitive broadband PCS marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the Suite 12 Group advocate adoption
of a gross revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth.
The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy recommends that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together
with affiliates) have less than $40 million in gross revenue. Similarly, Suite 12 suggests a $75 million in annual
sales threshold.
<FOOTCITE>147</FOOTCITE>
 As another option, the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy suggests that the Commission consider a higher revenue ceiling

comments of SBA Associate Administrator for Procurement Assistance at 2, CFW Communications at 2, and Iowa Network

of this alternative SBA definition would open up a huge loophole in the designated entity eligibility criteria. Specifically,
they contend that telecommunications is a capital, rather than labor, intensive industry, and that an entity with
1,500 employees is likely to be extremely well capitalized and have no need for the special treatment mandated by Congress
in the Budget Act.

174. We expect broadband PCS to be a highly capital intensive business requiring bidders to expend tens of millions
of dollars to acquire a license and construct a system even in the smaller broadband PCS markets. Thus, we believe that
our current small business definition is overly restrictive because it would exclude most businesses possessing
the financial resources to compete successfully in the provision of broadband PCS services. Accordingly, we modify
our small business definition for broadband PCS auctions to ensure the participation of small businesses with the
financial resources to compete effectively in an auction and in the provision of broadband PCS services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
175. There is substantial support in the record for a $40 million gross revenue standard. For example, the SBA recommends
that for broadband PCS, a small business be defined as one whose average annual gross revenues for its past three years
do not exceed $40 million.
<FOOTCITE>149</FOOTCITE>
 It states that this definition isolates those companies that have significantly greater difficulty in obtaining
capital than large enterprises. At the same time, the SBA contends that a company with $40 million in revenue is sufficiently
large that it could survive in a competitive wireless communications market.
<FOOTCITE>150</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy asserts that a $40 million threshold will allow participation by firms
``of sufficient size to meet demands in almost all small markets and some medium-size markets without significant
outside financial assistance.''
<FOOTCITE>151</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of broadband PCS, we shall therefore define a small business as any firm, together with its attributable
investors and affiliates, with average gross revenues for the three preceding years not in excess of $40 million.
<FOOTCITE>152</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, an applicant will not qualify as a small business if any one attributable investor in, or affiliate of,
the entity has $40 million or more in personal net worth.

Unlike our eligibility criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we do not adopt a total assets standard here.

176. For purposes of determining whether an entity qualifies as a small business, we will follow the control group
and attribution rules set forth with regard to eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications a control group that holds at least 50.1 percent

member's affiliates will be counted toward the $40 million gross revenue threshold, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant. The $40 million personal net worth limitation will also apply to each member
of the control group. We will not consider the gross revenues or personal net worth of any other investor unless the
investor holds 25 percent or more of the outstanding passive equity in the applicant, which, as defined above, includes
as much as five percent of the voting stock in a corporate applicant.

177. We also adopt the more relaxed attribution standard set forth in the entrepreneurs' blocks section with regard
to investors in minority and female-owned applicants. Specifically, we will not consider the gross revenues or personal
net worth of a single passive investor in a minority or female-owned small business unless the investor holds in excess
of a 49.9 percent passive interest (which includes as much as five percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock),
provided the women or minority control group maintains at least 50.1 percent of the equity and, in the case of a corporate
applicant, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>154</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that such revenue attribution will ensure that only

small businesses are able to take advantage of the special provisions we have adopted, but will allow those businesses
to attract sufficient equity capital to be truly viable contenders in the PCS industry.

178. These financial eligibility rules will continue to apply throughout the license term. Thus, firms that received
bidding credits and ``enhanced'' installment payments based on their small business status will be subject to the
repayment penalties outlined above, if an investor subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25 percent or more of the firm's equity) and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million gross
revenues cap, or the personal net worth of the investor exceeds the $40 million personal net worth threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
179. Finally, we will allow a consortium of small businesses to qualify for any of the measures adopted in this order
applicable to individual small businesses. As used here, the term ``consortium'' means a conglomerate organization
formed as a joint venture among mutually-independent business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition
of a small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
180. Several commenters argue that a consortium should not qualify for special treatment unless the consortium itself
meets the established definitional criteria.
<FOOTCITE>155</FOOTCITE>
 They contend that the FCC should not allow consortia to be used as a means of circumventing the usual prerequisites
for these special provisions. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we concluded that consortia might be permitted to receive benefits based on participation in the consortium by one
or more designated entities, but believed such a consortium should not be entitled to qualify for measures designed
specifically for designated entities. As a general matter, we shall continue to adhere to that principle. We think,
however, that in the broadband PCS service, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner is necessary
to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate in auctions
and to become strong broadband PCS competitors. Because of the exceptionally large capital requirements in this
service, we agree with the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy that, so long as individual members of the consortium satisfy
the definition of a small business, the congressional objective of ensuring opportunities for small business will
be fully met. Individual small entities that join to form consortia, as distinguished from a single entity with gross
revenues in excess of $40 million, still are likely to encounter capital access problems and, thus, should qualify
for members aimed at small businesses. We do not believe however, that this congressional goal will be satisfied if
special measures are allowed for consortia that are ``predominantly'' or ``significantly'' owned and/or controlled
by small businesses, as recommended by several commenters.
<FOOTCITE>156</FOOTCITE>

and women-owned firms and thereby to ensure that these groups have the opportunity to participate and become strong
competitors in the broadband PCS service.
<FOOTCITE>157</FOOTCITE>
 We thus have adopted a tax certificate program for women and minorities to allow more sources of potential funding,
have relaxed the attribution standard used to determine eligibility to bid for licenses on frequency blocks C and
F, and have adopted special measures for installment payments and bidding credits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There, we found generally that to establish ownership by minorities and women, a strict eligibility standard should
be adopted that required minorities or women to have at least a 50.1 percent equity stake and a 50.1 percent controlling
interest in the designated entity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;277; 47 CFR &sect;1.2110(b)(2). For the broadband PCS auctions, we retain the requirement that minorities
and/or women control the applicant and hold at least 50.1 percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock. However,
to establish their eligibility for certain benefits, summarized below, we shall impose an additional requirement
that, even where minorities and women hold at least 50.1 percent of the applicant's equity, other investors in the
applicant may own only passive interests, which, for corporate applicants, is defined to include as much as five percent
of the voting stock. In addition, provided that certain restrictions are met, we shall also allow women and minority-owed
firms the option to reduce to 25 percent the 50.1 percent minimum equity amount that must be held.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
183. We emphasized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that we did not intend to restrict the use of various equity financing mechanisms and incentives to attract financing,
provided that the minority and women principals continued to own 50.1 percent of the equity, calculated on a fully-diluted
basis, and that their equity interest entitled them to a substantial stake in the profits and liquidation value of
the venture relative to the non-controlling principals. We noted, however, that different standards that meet the
same objectives may be appropriate in other contexts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;278. In view of the evidence of discriminatory lending experiences faced by minority and women entrepreneurs
and the exceptional great financial resources believed to be required by broadband PCS applicants, we conclude that
it is appropriate to allow more flexibility with regard to the 50.1 percent equity requirements for this service in
order to open doors to more sources of equity financing for women and minority-owned firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184. We shall therefore allow women and minority-owned firms the following options. First, they may satisfy the general
definition set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which requires the minority and/or female principles to control the applicant, own at least 50.1 percent of its equity
and, in the case of corporate applicants, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Under this option, other investors
may own as much as a 49.9 percent passive equity interest. As noted above regarding eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, passive equity in the corporate context means only non-voting stock may be held, or stock that includes no
more than five percent of the voting interests.
<FOOTCITE>158</FOOTCITE>
 For partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the
equity. In addition, as required in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
all investor interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis, meaning that agreements such as stock options,
warrants and convertible debentures generally will be considered to have a present effect and will be treated as if
the rights thereunder have been fully exercised.
<FOOTCITE>159</FOOTCITE>
 We recognize that the requirement that other investors own only passive interests is a departure from the definition
of a minority or women-owned business adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
but because of the very significant financial contribution that may be made by such other investors in designated
entities, we believe that the passive equity requirement is appropriate as an additional safeguard to ensure that
minorities and/or women retain control of the applicant.

For example, under this option, a corporate applicant with two classes of issued and outstanding stock, 100 shares
of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, could sell to a single non-eligible entity 49.9 percent of the applicant's
equity, consisting of 5 shares of the corporate's voting stock and 94 shares of its non-voting stock. Under this scenario,
eligible minorities or women, in order to retain at least 50.1 percent of the value of all outstanding shares of the
corporation's stock, must own all of the corporation's remaining shares of stock; that is, 95 shares of voting stock
and six shares of non-voting stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As also noted in the Second Report and Order, we will consider departing from the requirement that the equity of investors
in minority and women-owned businesses must be calculated on a fully-diluted basis only upon a demonstration, in
individual cases, that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority
and women principals of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated
equity.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
185. As a second option, women and minority-owned firms may sell up to 75 percent of the company's equity, provided
that no single investor may hold 25 percent or more of the firm's passive equity, which is defined in the same manner
as above. For example, a corporation with 100 shares of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, with the 200
shares representing the total outstanding shares of the company, could qualify as a minority or women-owned business
under the following circumstances. The minority or women principals would have to own at least 51 shares of voting
stock, which satisfies the requirement that they have voting control and, in this case, also meets the requirements
that they hold at least 25 percent of the equity. Two other investors could each own 44 shares of non-voting stock and
five shares of voting stock, which represents 24.5 percent of the company's equity for each of the shareholders. A
third investor could own the remaining 12 shares of non-voting stock and five shares of the voting stock, or 8.5 percent
of the equity. The remaining 34 shares of voting stock may be sold to other investors provided that no single investor
owns more than five shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
186. Whichever option is chosen, we will require establishment of a ``control group'' in much the same way we did for
purposes of eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, winning bidders, transferees or assignees
must identify on their long-form applications a control group (consisting entirely of minorities and/or women or
entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and women) that has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant and holds either at least 50.1 or 25 percent of the applicant's equity, depending upon which
option is elected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
187. We believe that a modification of our 50.1 percent equity requirement will best achieve Congress' objective
of providing effective and long-term economic opportunities for women and minority-owned firms in broadband PCS.
At the same time, we shall maintain strict enforcement of the requirement that actual control reside with the qualified
designated entities. Thus, to establish their eligibility for tax certificates, enhanced installment payments,
bidding credits and relaxed cellular attribution rules, women and minority-owned applicants electing to use the
25 percent equity option may not in any instance allow an individual investor who is not in the control group to own more
than a 25 percent passive equity interest. This restriction will apply even in circumstances in which allowing an
investor to exceed these limitations would not result in the applicant's exceeding the gross revenues and other financial
standards that apply to other bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks and other situations involving financial caps.
These structural safeguards, as well as the general requirement that other investors hold only passive interests
in women and minority-owned applicants, will help to ensure that control truly remains with the women and minority
designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
188. For example, a women or minority-owned firm electing to use the 25 percent option may have a non-eligible investor
with more than a 25 percent passive stake and still qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or for benefits that
apply to small businesses, as long as the attributable revenues of the investor do not cause the applicant to exceed
the gross revenues/total assets caps. In these contexts, no additional restrictions are necessary, because women
and minority-owned applicants, like other applicants, are eligible to bid in these blocks and to qualify as small
businesses so long as they comply with the same restrictions on financial eligibility that apply to other applicants.
Since the attribution rule itself operates to ensure compliance with size limitations, it is not necessary to impose
additional restrictions on the size of interests held by investors with attributable interests. This firm will not
qualify, however, for special measures applicable only to women and minority-owned businesses, such as ``enhanced''
installment payments or the 15 or 25 percent bidding credits, because it has a single non-eligible investor with more
than a 25 percent passive interest. In circumstances in which women and minorities are required to retain only 25 percent
of the firm's equity, this additional structural restriction is appropriate because the objective in this context
is to ensure not merely financial eligibility, but that women and minorities retain control of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
189. We set forth previously rules defining more explicitly the term ``control'' for purposes of determining whether
a ``control group'' maintains

de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of an applicant.
<FOOTCITE>160</FOOTCITE>
 Those rules apply equally to the minority and women principals of minority and women-owned applicants. Consistent
with our general policies with regard to women-owned applicants for purposes of our multiple ownership and cross-ownership
rules in this broadcast context, we shall not adopt, at this time, any special rules or presumptions to determine whether
women-owned applicants exercise independent control of their firms.

190. Our requirement that control rest with minorities and/or women and the clarifications above ensure that parties
do not attempt to evade the statutory requirement to provide economic opportunities and ensure participation by
businesses owned by these groups. We reaffirm our commitment to investigate all allegations of fronts, shams or other
methods used by those who try to obtain a benefit to which they are not lawfully entitled. In this vein, we again admonish
parties that we will conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure that applicants receiving these benefits
are

191. We also note here that we are departing from the provision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that bars publicly traded companies from qualifying as minority and woman-owned businesses for purposes of participating
in auctions. Most of the steps taken to assist these designated entities in this Order (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bidding credits and installment payments) are confined to winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks, where there
is a financial limit on the size of participants. Because of the expected large capital entry costs of broadband PCS,
we believe that even publicly traded companies owned by women and minorities that qualify to bid in blocks C and F require
additional measures, such as bidding credits and installment payments, to be able to participate successfully.
We emphasize, however, that the exception to the attribution rules for publicly traded companies to be eligible to
bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks does not apply here.
<FOOTCITE>161</FOOTCITE>
 To qualify for measures targeted exclusively to women and minority-owned businesses, a company must satisfy the
definition set forth in this section.

With regard to qualifying to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we stated that we would not attribute the revenues or
assets of an investor that owns up to 15 percent of a publicly traded applicant's voting stock. For privately held companies,
the voting stock threshold is five percent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
192. As noted above, applicants owned by women and minorities must meet the limitations on gross revenues, total assets
and personal net worth to qualify for entry into the entrepreneurs' blocks. The size limitations do not apply, however,
to all measures designed to assist applicants owned by minorities and/or women. The tax certificate policy applies
to all broadband PCS licenses and is not limited to licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Therefore, businesses
owned by minorities and women need not meet the gross revenue and other financial restrictions to qualify for tax certificates.
Similarly, the relaxed cellular attribution threshold for minority and women-owned firms adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is not limited to the entrepreneurs' blocks. Thus, minority and women-owned firms that do not meet the gross revenues,
total assets and net worth restrictions may nevertheless qualify for the 40 percent cellular attribution rule. But
minority and women-owned firms must satisfy the Commission's structural ownership requirements to receive the
benefits of tax certificates and the relaxed cellular attribution rule; that is, they are subject to the limitation
that interests held by investors who are not women and minorities must be passive.

 most of those responding to our tentative conclusion in the Notice concerning the definition of a rural telephone
company contended that the proposed definition, which was based on the standard contained in Section 63.58 of the
Commission's Rules, was too restrictive. A variety of more inclusive definitions were recommended.
<FOOTCITE>163</FOOTCITE>
 Some commenters advocated a definition in which a company would qualify if it satisfied either of two alternative
criteria based on population of communities served or number of access lines.
<FOOTCITE>164</FOOTCITE>
 Others advocated adoption of a definition focusing simply on the number of access lines provided.
<FOOTCITE>165</FOOTCITE>
 One commenter advocated a definition focusing exclusively on revenues rather than access lines, with the standard
for rural telephone company status at annual revenues under $100 million.
<FOOTCITE>166</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, some advocated a somewhat more restrictive definition.

195. Many commenters suggested limiting rural telephone eligibility to carriers serving communities with no more
than 10,000 inhabitants, asserting that such a standard better comports with common notions about which telephone
companies are ``rural.''
<FOOTCITE>168</FOOTCITE>
 A number of other commenters supported a definition of rural telephone company that would include a limitation on
the size of the company. OPASTCO, for example, asserted that such a limitation would comport with the statutory mandate
to ensure opportunity for rural telephone companies because ``the problem such companies face in the competitive
bidding arena'' is as much a function of their size as of the rural character of their service areas.''
<FOOTCITE>169</FOOTCITE>
 NTCA similarly contended that small companies have shown the interest and commitment needed to fulfill the explicit
statutory goal of ``rapid deployment of new *&blank;*&blank;* services for *&blank;*&blank;* those residing in
rural areas,'' citing as support a report on the deployment of digital switching by small LECs.
<FOOTCITE>170</FOOTCITE>
 Other parties suggested that we look to the unenacted antecedent of the Budget Act, S. 1134, in which a rural company
was defined as an entity that either (a) ``provides telephone exchange service by wire in a rural area'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a non-urbanized area containing no incorporated place with more than 10,000 inhabitants), (b) ``provides telephone
exchange service by wire to less than 10,000 subscribers,'' or (c) ``is a telephone utility whose income accrues to
a State or political subdivision thereof.''

Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted a definition of ``rural telephone company'' that includes independently owned and operated local exchange
carriers that (1) do not serve communities with more than 10,000 inhabitants in the licensed area, and (2) do not have
more than 50,000 access lines, including all affiliates. 47 CFR &sect;1.2110(b)(3). We stated our belief that a limitation
on the size of eligible rural telephone companies is appropriate because Congress did not intend for us to give special
treatment to large LECs that happen to serve small rural communities.

 argue that the definition adopted for rural telephone companies may be too restrictive given the capital intensive
nature of broadband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>171</FOOTCITE>
 We also note that NTCA argued in its comments in this proceeding that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to use
the same criteria to define rural telephone companies in rules pertaining to different services, technologies,
and industries.

 Likewise, in an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 letter, OPASTCO states that by defining rural telephone company for purposes of broadband PCS as a local exchange
carrier with less than $100 million in revenue, the Commission will properly capture in the defined class locally-owned
telephone companies who are truly interested in providing services to rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>173</FOOTCITE>
 OPASTCO notes that the ``same universe of companies'' that would fall under such a revenue threshold would be captured
by a definition that includes all telephone companies having 100,000 or fewer access lines.

198. Our challenge in establishing a definition of a rural telephone company for broadband PCS is to achieve the congressional
goal of promoting the rapid deployment of this new service in rural areas by targeting only those telephone companies
whose service territories are predominantly rural in nature, and who are thus likely to be able to use on their existing
wireline telephone networks to build broadband PCS infrastructures to serve rural America. For purposes of our rules
governing broadband PCS licenses, we believe that this goal can best be achieved if we define rural telephone companies
as those local exchange carriers having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. We agree with OPASTCO
that such a definition will include virtually all of the telephone companies who genuinely are interested in providing
services to rural areas. This definition will encourage participation by legitimate rural telephone companies
without providing special treatment to large LECs. Therefore, we will better achieve the congressional goal of providing
service rapidly to rural areas without giving benefits to large companies that do not require such assistance. Rural
telephone companies that satisfy this definition thus will be eligible for rural partitioning, as discussed above.

199. Anchorage Telephone Company argues in a petition for reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that our definition of a rural telephone company should include telephone companies that are owned by governmental
authorities. Anchorage contends that Congress meant to mandate special consideration not only for telephone carriers
serving rural areas but also for all municipally-owned telcos, even those with wholly or predominantly urban service
areas.
<FOOTCITE>176</FOOTCITE>
 This argument is based on its interpretation of the Senate bill that was antecedent to the enacted Budget Act. Anchorage
argues that the Senate bill containing the prototype of a mandate for special consideration for rural telephone companies
directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers and explicitly said that the
category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned telephone companies. Anchorage
further states that the report of the conference committee that drafted the Budget Act declares that the Senate's
``findings'' are incorporated by reference.
<FOOTCITE>177</FOOTCITE>
 Anchorage also asserts that without the aid of special assistance it and most other state-owned and municipal telcos
won't be able to purchase spectrum licenses at auction because it is politically infeasible for them to generate and
retain enough surplus revenue to fund such investments, due to popular aversion to increases in taxes or telephone
rates.

200. We find no merit in Anchorage's arguments. There is no specific evidence that Congress intended the term ``rural
telephone companies'' to include all state or municipally-owned telephone companies. To the contrary, the fact
that an antecedent bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential treatment of government-owned telephone
companies that was deleted from the enacted bill could just as easily be interpreted as an indication that Congress
rejected such a rule. Further, we disagree that state and municipal governments lack the means to participate successfully
in auctions. Such governments have substantial capabilities to raise funds through private financing, bond offerings
and taxation. Therefore, our definition of a rural telephone company will not encompass telephone companies that
are owned by government authorities.

201. Many of the eligibility criteria set forth above are based on the size of the entity applying for a broadband PCS
license and/or seeking special treatment under our designated entity policies. Each of these size standards ($125
million gross revenues/$500 million total assets/$100 million personal net worth, $40 million gross revenues/$40
million personal net worth, and 100,000 access lines) requires applicants to include, among other parties, ``affiliates''
when calculating their attributable gross revenues, total assets, net worth or access lines. This affiliation requirement
is intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet these size standards from receiving
benefits targeted to smaller entities.
<FOOTCITE>179</FOOTCITE>
 We adopt specific affiliation rules for purposes of applying these eligibility criteria based in part on the Small
Business Administration's affiliation rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we referenced the SBA's affiliation rules for purposes of defining generally whether an entity qualifies as a small
business and gave examples of how the affiliation rules would be applied. We continue to believe that the SBA's affiliation
rules provide a solid foundation on which to build our own affiliation rules for purposes of the small business definition
for broadband PCS and for the other size standards adopted in this order.
<FOOTCITE>181</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, for purposes of these eligibility restrictions, we will again borrow from the SBA's rules for outside
affiliations. In addition, to ensure that applicants have clear guidance concerning these matters, we shall include
in our rules more detailed information concerning the circumstances in which an entity will be deemed an affiliate
of the applicant.

203. Like the eligibility rules we have adopted here governing size limitations for broadband PCS, the SBA's rules
provide that size determinations shall include the applicant and all of its ``affiliates.''
<FOOTCITE>182</FOOTCITE>
 At the outset, before considering in more detail all the types of affiliations that might exist when guided by the SBA
rules, we review briefly our own rules described above, concerning attributable interests. Those rules provide
that, so long as a control group is established, the gross revenues, assets or net worth of an investor in a PCS applicant
or licensee will be attributed to the applicant or licensee only if the investor holds more than 25 percent of the applicant's
passive equity or is part of a control group that controls the applicant. Therefore, only where an investor has such
attributable interests in the broadband PCS applicant or licensee do we need to examine whether the investor has a
relationship with other persons or outside entities that rises to the level of an affiliation with the PCS applicant,
and if so, whether the affiliate's revenues or net worth, when aggregated with the applicant's, exceed our size eligibility
thresholds.

General Principles of Affiliation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When such an attributable interest exists, an affiliation under the SBA rules would arise, first, from ``control''
of an entity or the ``power to control it.'' Thus, under the SBA rules, entities are affiliates of each other when either
directly or indirectly (i) one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or (ii) a third party or parties
controls or has the power to control both. 13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2)(i), (ii). In determining control, the SBA's
rules provide generally that every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly
control or have the power to control it. The rules, in addition, provide specific examples of where control resides
under various scenarios, such as through stock ownership or occupancy of director, officer or management positions.
The rules also articulate general principles of control, and note, for example, that control may be affirmative or
negative and that it is immaterial whether control is exercised so long as the power to control exists. 13 CFR &sect;121.401(c)(1).
Second, an affiliation, under SBA rules, may also arise out of an ``identity of interest'' between or among parties.
13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2)(iii), (d). We shall adopt these same general provisions in our affiliation rules for
broadband PCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
205. In adopting these affiliation rules, we emphasize that these rules will not be applied in a manner that defeats
the objectives of our attribution rules. Our attribution rules expressly permit applicants to disregard the gross
revenues, total assets and net worth of passive investors, provided that an eligible control group has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant. Our attribution rules are designed to preserve control of the applicant by eligible entities,
yet allow investment in the applicant by entities that do not meet the size restrictions in our rules. Therefore, so
long as the requirements of our attribution rules are met, the affiliation rules will not be used to defeat the underlying
policy objectives of allowing such passive investors. More specifically, if a control group has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant, we shall not construe the affiliation rules in a manner that causes the interests of passive
investors to be attributed to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
206. Applying these SBA affiliation rules, and affiliation would arise, for example, where an entity with an attributable
interest in a broadband PCS applicant is under the control of another entity. An affiliation would also arise where
an entity with an attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant controls, or has the power to control, another
entity. For example, if a 10 percent voting shareholder of a PCS applicant is also a shareholder in a large Corporation
X, when should Corporation X be deemed an affiliate of the PCS applicant as a result of the shareholder's ownership
interest in both entities? Under the SBA rules and the rules we adopt here, Corporation X would be deemed an affiliate
of the applicant if the shareholder controlled or had the power to control Corporation X, in which case, Corporation
X's gross revenues must be included in determining the applicant's gross revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
207. For purposes of determining control, ownership interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. Thus,
for example, stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle)
will generally be considered to have a present effect on the power to control or own an interest in either an outside
entity or the PCS applicant or licensee.
<FOOTCITE>183</FOOTCITE>
 We will treat such options, debentures, and agreements generally as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised.
<FOOTCITE>184</FOOTCITE>
 However, an affiliate cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over or relationship
with another concern before it actually does so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 1. If company ``A'' holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company ``B,'' the situation is treated
as though company ``A'' had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling interest in company ``B.'' The
[annual revenues] of both concerns must be taken into account in determining size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 2. If company ``A'' has entered into an agreement to merge with company ``B'' in the future, the situation is
treated as though the merger has taken place. [A and B are affiliates of each other].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
. SBA's rules provide this example:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If large company ``A'' holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company ``B'' and gives a third
party an option to purchase 66 of the 70 shares owned by company ``A,'' company ``B'' will be deemed to be an affiliate
of company ``A'' until the third party actually exercises its option to purchase such shares. In order to prevent large
company ``A'' from circumventing the intent of the regulation which [gives] present effect to stock options, the
option is not considered to have present effect in this case.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Voting and Other Trusts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a similar vein, we also borrow from the SBA's rules and our own rules in other services to find affiliation under certain
voting trusts in order to prevent a circumvention of eligibility rules. The SBA's rules provide that a voting trust,
or similar agreement, cannot be used to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock for the purpose
of shifting control of or the power to control an outside concern, if the primary purpose of the trust is to meet size
eligibility rules.
<FOOTCITE>186</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, under the Commission's broadcast multiple ownership rules, stock interests held in trust may be attributed
to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, has the sole power to sell such stock, has the right to revoke
the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will.
<FOOTCITE>187</FOOTCITE>
 Also, under the broadcast rules, if a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the
grantor or the beneficiary of a trust, the stock interests held in trust will be considered assets of the grantor or
beneficiary, as appropriate.
<FOOTCITE>188</FOOTCITE>
 Because we believe the broadcast rules provide more definitive guidance in this particular area, we shall use them
as a model for the affiliation rules adopted here. Thus, for example, if an investor with an attributable interest
in a PCS applicant holds a beneficial interest in stock of another firm that amounts to a controlling interest in that
other firm, depending on the identity of the trustee, the other firm may be considered an affiliate and its assets and
gross revenues may be attributed to the PCS applicant.

Officers, Directors and Key Employees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the SBA's affiliation rules, affiliations also generally arise where persons serve as the officers, directors
or key employees of another concern and they represent a majority or controlling element of that other concern's board
of directors and/or management of the outside entity.
<FOOTCITE>189</FOOTCITE>
 We shall adopt an identical rule. Thus, if a person with an attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant, through
his or her other key employment positions or positions on the board of another firm, controls that other firm, then
the other firm will be considered an affiliate of the applicant. Such affiliations may or may not result in the applicant's
exceeding our size limitations. As this rule reflects, for purposes of attributing the financial position of an outside
entity in this context, officers and directors of an outside concern are not foreclosed entirely from holding attributable
or non-attributable interests in a PCS applicant. Whether or not such persons control the outside entity, we also
do not want to prohibit these persons, who may be experienced in the telecommunications, finance, or communications
and equipment industries, from assisting start-up companies in PCS by serving as officers or directors of the applicant.
Thus, under our general attribution rule, if such persons serving as officers or directors of the applicant do not
control the applicant or otherwise have an attributable interest in the applicant, their outside affiliations (even
if controlling) will not be considered at all for purposes of determining the applicant's eligibility under our rules.

SBA's size standard affiliation rules also provide that affiliations can arise in a variety of other scenarios, such
as where one concern is dependent upon another for contracts and business, where firms share joint facilities, or
have joint venture of franchise license agreements. To the extent we believe these rules may have general applicability
in the context of our policies for broadband PCS, we shall codify them in our affiliate rules. We caution parties that
issues relating to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant (or parties with attributable interests in the applicant) could also arise under arrangements
not expressly codified in the rules.

Affiliation Through Identity of Interest: Family and Spousal Relationships. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As expressed in the SBA's rules, an affiliation may arise not only through control, but out of an ``identity of interest''
between or among parties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2)(iii). For example, affiliation can arise between or among members of the same family
or persons with common investments in more than one concern. In determining who controls or has the power to control
an entity, persons with an identity of interests may be treated as though they were one person. 13 CFR &sect;121.401(d).
For example, if two shareholders in Corporation X are both attributable shareholders in the PCS applicant, to the
extent that together they have the power to control Corporation X, Corporation X may be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211. Similarly, as under the SBA rules, we must consider spousal and other family relationships in determining whether
an affiliation exists. Under the SBA rules for determining small business status, for example, members of the same
family may be treated as though they were one person because they have an ``identity of interest.'' 13 CFR &sect;121.401(d).
Likewise, in order to determine whether individuals are economically disadvantaged, the SBA rules governing eligibility
for participation in the government's ``section 8(a)'' program for socially and economically disadvantaged small
businesses have special provisions for attributing spousal interests. The latter rules provide generally that
half of the jointly-owned interests of an applicant and his or her spouse must be attributed to the applicant for purposes
of determining the applicant's net worth. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13 CFR &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i)(A)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
212. In the context of the auction eligibility rules at issue here, we begin by clarifying that our reason for considering
spousal and kinship relationships is not to determine whether the spouse or other kin of a woman-owned applicant actually
is controlling the applicant, thereby violating our eligibility rules for woman-owned businesses. As discussed
above, our rules do not embody any presumptions concerning spousal control in that context.
<FOOTCITE>191</FOOTCITE>
 Rather, our objective here is to ensure both that entities permitted to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks are actually
in need of special financial assistance and that otherwise ineligible entities do not circumvent the rules prohibiting
entry by funding family members that purport to be eligible applicants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
213. In formulating these rules, we need to consider also that, as a practical matter, it will not be possible for us
prior to the auctions to resolve all questions that pertain to the individual circumstances of particular applicants.
Furthermore, if we determine subsequent to an auction that a winning bidder in fact was ineligible to bid because of
spousal or kinship relationships, not only will authorization of service be delayed but, as discussed above, disqualified
applicants may be subject to substantial penalties. In these circumstances, we think that the public interest requires
that we endeavor, insofar as possible, to establish brightline tests for determining when the financial interests
of spouses and other kin should be attributed to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
214. We have decided that, for purposes of determining whether the financial limitations in our eligibility rules
have been met, we will in every instance attribute the financial interests of an applicant's spouse to the applicant.
This will resolve any concern that an applicant might transfer his or her assets to a spouse in order to satisfy the personal
net worth or control restrictions that apply to eligible entities. For example, an applicant could not transfer stock
or other assets to his or her spouse and thereby dispose of interests that, if held by the applicant, would render the
applicant ineligible. Just as importantly, this approach will resolve any concern that an applicant might participate
in bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks by using the personal assets of an ineligible spouse, which would defeat entirely
the objective of excluding very large entities from bidding in these blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
215. In adopting this rule, we fully recognize that instances could arise in which, if all factors were considered,
attributing a spouse's financial interests to the applicant could lead to harsh results. As a general matter, however,
we think it provides a workable bright-line standard that resolves fully our policy concerns and avoids undesirable
ambiguity concerning the nature of our requirements. As in the SBA rules, however, one exception is clearly warranted;
this affiliation standard would not apply if the applicant and his or her spouse are subject to a legal separation recognized
by a court of competent jurisdiction. In calculating their personal net worth, investors in the applicant who are
legally separated must, of course, still include their share of interests in community property held with a spouse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
216. As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to
evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same
potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests''
that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when
kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied
by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests
between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that
the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related
in business matters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 933 F.2d 261 (5th Cir. 1990). For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition
that is identical to the definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR &sect;124.100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
217. In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with
relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the
relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the
auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility
rules. Our holding period rule, which, as discussed above, requires that winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks
maintain an ownership structure meeting our eligibility requirements for five years, will serve as an additional
safeguard against possible abuses arising from kinship relationships.

218. In fashioning rules for competitive bidding for broadband PCS licenses, we seek to promote the public policy
goals set forth for us by Congress. We believe that the rules adopted in this Fifth Report and Order satisfy this objective.
These rules should facilitate the rapid implementation of new broadband communications services through advanced
technologies and efficient spectrum use, thus advancing the public interest by providing consumers with competitive
and innovative wireless voice and data services and also fostering economic growth. The rules will allow for the public
to recover a portion of the value of the public spectrum, and will promote access to broadband PCS services by consumers,
producers and new entrants by ensuring that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by
minorities and women will have genuine opportunities to participate in the auctions and in the provision of service.
We expect that the advent of PCS will benefit consumers by raising the overall level of competition in many already
competitive segments of the telecommunications industry and providing competition in others for the first time,
promote job creation in the communications and information sector of the domestic economy, and enhance productivity
and efficiency in industry as a whole.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need for and purpose of the action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended. The
rules adopted herein will carry out Congress's intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for broadband
PCS licenses. The rules adopted herein also will carry out Congress's intent to ensure that small businesses, rural
telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in
the provision of spectrum-based services.

Broadband PCS subject to competitive bidding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide broadband PCS service are subject to competitive bidding procedures.
The general competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q will apply unless otherwise provided
in this part.

&sect;24.702 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Competitive bidding design for Broadband PCS licensing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive
initial applications to provide broadband PCS service: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sequential auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The Commission will announce by Public Notice before
each auction the competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount or percentage. Combinatorial
bidding may be used with any type of auction design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;24.703

Competitive bidding mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sequencing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will establish and may vary the sequence in which broadband PCS licenses will be auctioned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Grouping. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial
bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reservation Price. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject
to auction will not be awarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Bid Increments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage
terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stopping Rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an auction
within a reasonable time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Activity Rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder
will be entitled to request and will be automatically granted one waiver of such rule during each auction stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Suggested Minimum Bid. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission may establish suggested minimum bids on each license. Bids below the suggested minimum bid would count
as activity under the activity rule only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;24.702(a)(1), the Commission
will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, who default on payments due
after an auction closes, or who are disqualified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty equal to the difference
between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal
penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted
from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder was deposited with the Commission.

Default or disqualification after close of auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject
to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent
winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will
be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments
or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When the Commission conducts sequential oral auctions pursuant to &sect;24.702(a)(2), the Commission may modify
the penalties set forth in subsection (a) above to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification;
provided, however, that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal
penalty will be assessed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the penalty
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An applicant; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nature of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
control 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in determining affiliation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity.
Affiliation exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons,
are in control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power to control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that
no effective control can be established.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with
an identity of interest, such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. In determining if the
applicant controls or has the power to control a concern, persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though
they were one person.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS applilcation. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in Interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by either of them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the United States. In calculating their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their share of
interests in property held jointly with a spouse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control
interests owned or controlled by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means
father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law,
brother- or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother
or sister. This presumption may be rebutted by showing that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The family members are estranged,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The family ties are remote, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The family members are not closely involved with each other in business matters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Affiliation through stock ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of
a concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible
debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally considered to have a present
effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures,
and agreements are generally treated as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate
cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over another concern before it actually
does so.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its option
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the
merger has taken place.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Affiliation under voting trusts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Stock interests held in trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the power to vote such
stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at
will or to replace the trustee at will.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary,
the stock interests held in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership
of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern in order that such concern or
another concern may meet the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally arises where officers, directors, or key employees
serve as the majority or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or the management of another
entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally arises where one concern shares office space
and/or employees and/or other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns are in the same
or related industry or field of operations, or where such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation generally arises where one concern is dependent
upon another concern for contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or potential control,
of the other concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests
in any degree or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, specific business
venture for joint profit for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but
not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The determination whether an entity is
a joint venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business operation may be designated
by the parties involved. An agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the business operation is a joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated with each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Requests for waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A waiver of these rules may be granted upon application or by the Commission on its own motion. Requests for waivers
shall contain a statement of reason sufficient to justify a waiver. Waivers will not be granted except upon an affirmative
showing:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or would be frustrated, by its application in a particular
case, and that grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case render application of the rule inequitable, unduly
burdensome or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the lack of a reasonable alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference
to the specific filing where it may be found.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. If a waiver is not granted, the application will be dismissed as
defective unless the applicant has also provided an alternative proposal which complies with the Commission's rules
(including any required showings).

authority to install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may be submitted as an informal application
in the manner set forth in &sect;24.805 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed operation including all
facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the public interest therein. No such request will
be considered unless the request is received by the Commission at least 10 days prior to the date of proposed construction
or operation or, where an extension is sought, at least 10 days prior to the expiration date of the existing temporary
authorization. The Commission may accept a late-filed request upon due showing of sufficient reasons for the delay
in submitting such request.

(1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no application for regular operation is contemplated
to be filed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending the filing of an application for such regular operation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide
substantially the same service as previously authorized; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the
public interest and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may be granted under the standards of Section 309(f)
of the Communications Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the temporary authorization
for a period of 180 days each may also be granted, but the applicant bears a heavy burden to show that extraordinary circumstances
warrant such an extension.

otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be
feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal licensing procedure,
the Commission will grant radio station authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof,
during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special
temporary licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without the filing of formal applications.

(a) All applications for the initial provision of broadband PCS must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S.
Mutually exclusive initial applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services are subject to competitive
bidding. FCC Form 401 (``Application for New or Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted
by each winning bidder for each broadband PCS license for which application was made on FCC Form 175. In the event that
mutual exclusivity does not exist between applicants for a broadband PCS license that have filed FCC Form 175, the
sole applicant will be required to file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175&hyph;S, and 401 are subject
to the provisions of 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'') and Subpart H of this Part. Blanket
licenses are granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual sites are not needed and will not
be accepted.

(b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The assignment of a file number to an application is merely
for administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the application for filing and processing.
Such assignment of a file number will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found
to be not in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness.

date of a public notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing; provided,
however, that the Commission will not grant an application filed on Form 401 filed either by a winning bidder or by an

(a) Except as provided under &sect;24.829, any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right
if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to designation for hearing or, in the case of applications filed on Forms
175 and 175&hyph;S, prior to auction. An applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been accepted
for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of
their applications may be subject to penalties contained in &sect;1.2104 of this Chapter. Requests for dismissal
shall comply with the provisions of &sect;24.829 as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be considered after designation for hearing only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is properly served upon all parties of record, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The petition complies with the provisions of &sect;24.829 (whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within
a specified time period to official correspondence or requests for additional information. Dismissal shall be without
prejudice if made prior to designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made with prejudice for
unsatisfactory compliance with &sect;24.829 or after designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified
that it is the winning bidder under the auction process.

Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending
applications who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding.
This section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which &sect;&sect;24.823(c) and 24.823(g) apply or which would
cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under &sect;24.709, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application amendment, petition
or other pleading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of either pleadings or applications shall at the time of filing notify the Commission that such filing is the result
of an agreement or understanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The provisions of &sect;22.927 of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of the filing of petitions to deny
or other pleadings or informal objections filed against broadband PCS applications. The provisions of &sect;22.928
of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of dismissal of broadband PCS applications. The provisions of &sect;22.929
of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of threats to file petitions to deny or other pleadings or informal

 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain Cessna Citation Model 500/501, 550/551, S550, 552, and 560 series airplanes. That action would have required
modification of the landing light electrical circuit to eliminate failures of the left and right landing light switches
due to heavy current at the switch contacts. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
has received additional data that confirm that failure of the subject switches does not pose an unsafe condition.
Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add a new airworthiness directive
(AD), applicable to certain Cessna Citation Model 500/501, 550/551, S550, 552, and 560 series airplanes, was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 12, 1993 (58 FR 19069). That action was prompted by a report of failures of the left and right landing light switches
due to heavy current at the switch contacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have required modification of the landing light electrical circuit. The intent of the modification
was to preclude the possibility of failure of the landing light switches, which could lead to smoke and an electrical
fire in the cockpit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received additional data gathered from an analysis that was conducted
of the switch failure scenarios and the landing light switch design itself. These data indicate that the switch can
adequately carry the current associated with either incandescent or halogen landing light installations. Apparently,
the landing light switches that were involved in the reported incidents were of poor quality and were produced in only
a small limited batch. The failure scenario analysis indicates that the switches shorted internally, allowing an
odor and a trace of smoke to be released in the cockpit. In each case, however, the amount of smoke that was produced neither
created a hazard nor interfered in any way with the safe operation of the aircraft. Further, contrary to what was previously
reported, no fire occurred during any of the incidents as a result of the switch failure; the only identified discrepancy
in some of the incidents was the discoloration of the switch cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, further investigation of one of the reported incidents revealed that a wire connected to one of the
failed switches had discolored due to overheating caused by an undersized wire splice. (The undersized wire splice
may have been installed as a result of questionable maintenance.) This parictular problem is considered to be an isolated
incident and independent of the switch problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been no further failures of these switches since the original incidents that were reported (in 1992). As
the limited number of suspect switches have appeared to have been purged from aircraft service by attrition, no recent
failures have occurred. In addition, the FAA has not received any recent Malfunction or Defect Reports concerning
these switches. This reduction in such reports supports the premise that poor quality switches are no longer found
in the operators' inventories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the recent analysis data and other evidence presented, the FAA concludes that the switch failures are internal
to the switch itself and do not cause sufficient smoke or arcing in the cockpit to create a hazardous condition. The
FAA has determined that failure of the subject switches does not present an unsafe condition. Accordingly, the proposed
rule is hereby withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, that currently requires inspection of the wing rear spar lower cap aft
tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill to detect fatigue cracking, and repair, if necessary. This
action would require installation of a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap, and follow-on
inspections. This proposal is prompted by reports of additional cracking found in the current inspection area. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent propagation of cracks in the subject area, which could
compromise the structural integrity of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 25, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;8052 (56 FR 50650, October 8, 1991),
which is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive
inspections to detect fatigue cracking of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and the wing trailing edge access door
sill, and repair of any cracking found. That action was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the wing rear
spar lower cap aft tang on four Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes. This cracking was found during an inspection conducted
in accordance with the Supplemental Inspection Document (SID) program; that program was required to be implemented
by AD 89&hyph;22&hyph;10, amendment 39&hyph;6330 (54 FR 42291, October 16, 1989). The requirements of AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05
are intended to prevent fatigue cracking in the subject area. Such cracking, if not detected and corrected in a timely
manner, could compromise the structural integrity of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, there have been 10 additional reports of fatigue cracks found in the wing rear spar lower
cap aft tang. Such cracking presents the same unsafe condition as addressed by the existing AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the issuance of that AD, the manufacturer has developed a crack preventative modification of
the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and wing trailing edge access door sill that is intended to minimize the possibility
of cracking in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57&hyph;123, Revision 1, dated June
8, 1993, which contains procedures for conducting various inspections to detect fatigue cracking of the wing rear
spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill, and procedures for repairing any cracking
found. This revised service bulletin is essentially identical to the original version, which was referenced in AD
91&hyph;21&hyph;05 as the appropriate source of service information. The only relevant changes are a revised listing
of current operators of affected airplanes, and the inclusion of additional repair options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has also reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 57&hyph;123, dated June 8, 1993, that describes
procedures for installing a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and wing trailing
edge access door sill. This modification entails replacing Taper-Lok fasteners with straight titanium fasteners,
and cold working the holes in the wing rear spar lower cap forward and aft tangs between stations X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
ors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
=410.000. Accomplishment of this modification will minimize the possibility of fatigue cracking in the subject
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05 to continue to require repetitive inspections of
the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill to detect fatigue cracking,
and repair of any cracking found. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with either the
original or revised version of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57&hyph;123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed AD would also require the eventual installation of the crack preventative modification. Once this
modification is accomplished, repetitive post-modification inspections would be required after the accumulation
of a certain number of landings. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with McDonnell Douglas
Service Bulletin 57&hyph;123.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 282 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 175 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The currently required inspections take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the current inspection requirements of this
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,000, or $440 per airplane, per inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modification would take approximately 12 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per
work hour. Required parts would cost between $3,730 and $6,730 per airplane, depending upon the airplane model. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be between $4,390 and $7,390 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed post-modification inspections would take approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed post-modification
inspection requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $115,500, or $660 per airplane, per inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
current or proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is proposing amendments to its rule governing ethics training
for registrants to provide additional guidance relative to ethics training providers. The proposed amendments
would: allow a person to provide ethics training if he certifies to a registered futures association that he is not
subject to statutory disqualification from registration under the Commodity Exchange Act (Act), barred from service
on self-regulatory organization (SRO) governing boards or committees, or subject to a pending proceeding or investigation
with respect to possible violations of the Act or rules or orders promulgated thereunder; prohibit certain representations
with respect to a person's status as an ethics training provider; prohibit an ethics training provider from using
that fact to qualify as an expert witness in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission or from proffering evidence
of that fact to qualify as an expert witness in any adjudicatory proceeding to which the Commission is a party; allow
wider use of ethics training presentation by interactive means and videotape; and require ethics training providers
to furnish records of attendees to a registered futures association upon request.

This provision of the Act is codified at 7 U.S.C. 6p(b) (Supp. IV 1992) and states that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission shall issue regulations to require new registrants, within 6 months after receiving such registration,
to attend a training session, and all other registrants to attend periodic training sessions, to ensure that registrants
understand their responsibilities to the public under this Act, including responsibilities to observe just and
equitable principles of trade, any rule or regulation of the Commission, any rule of any appropriate contract market,
registered futures association, or other self-regulatory organization, or any other applicable Federal or state
law, rule or regulation.

The Commission has reviewed several applications from persons seeking to provide ethics training to registrants
and several other applications are currently pending with the Commission. In light of this experience, the Commission
is now proposing amendments to Rule 3.34 regarding ethics training providers in an effort to enhance the operation
of this program. Those provisions of the rule that relate to what must be covered in ethics training and specific requirements
concerning attendance at such training by registrants would remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Certification by Ethics Training Provider

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presently, there are three categories of persons that may provide ethics training to registrants under the Act: (1)
an SRO, such as an exchange which may have a program for its member floor brokers (FBs) and floor traders (FTs); (2) an
entity accredited to conduct continuing education programs by a state professional licensing authority in the fields
of law, finance, accounting or economics; or (3) any other person ``if its program is approved by the Commission for
this purpose.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposals set forth herein would maintain SROs and state-accredited continuing education programs as ethics
providers. The Commission is also proposing, however, to permit any other person to provide ethics training if the
person files a notice with a registered futures association certifying that the person, any principals thereof (as
defined in Commission Rule 3.1(a))
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and any individuals, on behalf of such person, who conduct in-person ethics training or who prepare ethics training
videotape or electronic presentations, are not subject to: (1) statutory disqualification from registration under
Sections 8a (2) or (3) or the Act;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (2) a bar from service on SRO governing boards or committees based on disciplinary histories, pursuant to Commission
Rule 1.63
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or any SRO rule adopted thereunder;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) a pending adjudicatory proceeding under Sections 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 8a or 9 of the Act or Commission Rules 3.55,
3.56 or 3.60;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

3.12(d)(1)(iv), and 3.12(i)(1)(iv) (1993)), to bar a person from serving as a sponsor or special supervisor of a conditioned

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Congressional mandate for ethics training is intended ``to ensure that registrants understand their responsibilities
to the public under [the] Act, including responsibilities to observe just and equitable principles of trade, any
rule or regulation of the Commission, any rules of any appropriate contract market, registered futures association,
or other self-regulatory organization or any other applicable Federal or State law, rule or regulation.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that it would be anomalous, inconsistent with the Congressional mandate and contrary to
the public interest for a person to teach others about their responsibilities under those laws and rules if such person
has a disciplinary history that would disqualify him from registration under the Act or service on SRO governing broads
or committees, or is involved in an adjudicatory proceeding or the subject of an investigation pertaining to violations
of such laws and rules. The Commission is also proposing that the certification requirement be a continuous one so
that if circumstances change and the certification becomes inaccurate, the person must so inform the registered
futures association, which shall then refuse to include such person on, or remove such person from, the list of ethics
training providers.

The items discussed above would apply to a certification from any ethics training provider. If the ethics training
provider will offer training via videotape or electronic presentation, the provider's certification would also
be required to include a statement with respect to verification of the registrant's attendance. This is discussed
below under Heading C, Videotape or Electronic Presentation.

However, if a firm is subject to a pending adjudicatory proceeding or investigation as described above, the Commission
believes that it could submit a certification to a registered futures association with an explanation describing
the circumstances of the proceeding or investigation, particularly with respect to the scope and nature of the proceeding
or investigation in relation to the size of the firm. For example, an investigation limited to a single branch office
of a firm that does not involve fraud or failure to supervise might be treated differently than a proceeding involving
such allegations against the top management of a firm. The Commission would expect the registered futures association
to consult the Commission as to any particular certification submitted or in cases where a firm on the list becomes
subject to a proceeding or investigation.

The purpose of this amendment is to permit National Futures Association (NFA), currently the only registered futures
association, to maintain the list of eligible ethics training providers for purposes of Commission Rule 3.34 and
to clarify that the specific content of an ethics training program is not being approved by the Commission or by NFA,
as discussed more fully below. The Commission would delegate authority to NFA to establish guidance as to the required
experience of ethics training providers and permit NFA to receive and evaluate complaints concerning such providers
and make other appropriate review of providers' operations, subject to Commission oversight. NFA would also be delegated
authority to develop appropriate procedures to verify certifications filed by a potential ethics training provider,
for having such certifications updated periodically and for refusing to include persons on the list of ethics training
providers.

When the Commission has granted applications to provide ethics training, it has stated in letters to the applicants,
among other things, that it has not approved the specific content of the ethics training program proposed and expresses
no opinion as to the program's quality or accuracy. Indeed, it would be impossible for the Commission to do so since
it has normally been presented with only an outline of the training course from those who filed applications.

 The Commission therefore believes that it is appropriate to clarify the effect of the blanket reference in Rule 3.34

registered futures association's listing of other persons providing such training.

Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to provide in new paragraph (b)(5)(i) that no SRO, state-accredited continuing
education entity or other person included on a list of ethics training providers ``may represent or imply in any manner
whatsoever that such person has been sponsored, recommended or approved, or that such person's abilities or qualifications,
the content, quality or accuracy of his training program, or the positions taken in the course of resolving any actual
or hypothetical situations presenting ethical issues, have in any respect been passed upon or endorsed, by the Commission
or a registered futures association.'' Proposed new paragraph (b)(5)(i) would further provide that any promotional
or instructional material used in connection with ethics training ``must prominently state that the Commission
and any registered futures association have not reviewed or approved the specific content of the training program
and do not recommend the provider of such training.''

Proposed paragraph (b)(5)(i) would also contain a proviso that it ``shall not be construed to prohibit a statement
that a person is included on a list of ethics training providers maintained by a registered futures association if
such statement is true in fact and if the effect of such a listing is not misrepresented.'' The effect of this statement
is intended to be that such person is not precluded from providing ethics training by reason of ``unfitness'' as defined
by the Act and the Commission's rules on statutory disqualification.

The Commission believes that these clarifications with respect to representations that may be made as to the effect
of providing ethics training, whether pursuant to self-executing provisions of the rule or to inclusion on a list
maintained by a registered futures association, are appropriate, particularly in light of existing limitations
upon the representations that may be made by registered commodity trading advisors (CTAs), commodity pool operators
(CPOs) or associated persons (APs) of CTAs and CPOs as to the effect of registration under the Act, which encompasses
a greater level of review than pertains to ethics providers.

The Commission similarly believes that it is appropriate to limit the use an ethics training provider may make of that
fact in certain adjudicatory proceedings. An ethics training provider should not be able to use that fact to qualify
as an expert witness or to present expert testimony in an adjudicatory proceeding before the Commission under Sections
6(c), 6(d), 8a or 14 of the Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 or Commission Rules 3.55, 3.56 or 3.60.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nor should an ethics training provider proffer evidence of that fact in order to demonstrate experience, competence
or knowledge that would qualify the provider as an expert witness in any adjudicatory proceeding to which the Commission
is a party, for example, a civil injunctive action brought by the Commission under Section 6c of the Act (7 U.S.C. 13c
(Supp. IV 1992)). The Commission is therefore proposing new paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(5)(iii) to so provide.
The Commission believes that because the rule amendments proposed herein provide for a person to be included on a list
of ethics providers based on a self-certification process, it would be inappropriate for any person included on such
a list to use that fact to demonstrate credentials as an expert witness. The Commission would not consider evidence
of a person's status as an ethics provider in any administrative proceeding before it, and would object to any such
proffer in any adjudicatory proceeding to which it is a party.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Commission adopted Rule 3.34, it provided in paragraph (b)(3) that a program of ethics training could include
a videotape or electronic presentation. The Commission stated that such training would be acceptable if the provider
could substantiate the registrant's completion of the program. The Commission further stated that such substantiation
contemplates, for example, an interactive computerized training program that requires and records the registrant's
participation and return of such computer disk to the ethics training provider for verification of such participation
and the provider's issuance of a certificate to that effect to the registrant.

The Commission had originally proposed allowing the use of videotape or electronic presentation in recognition
of the fact that it could be difficult for registrants located substantial distances from major metropolitan areas
to attend in-person training sessions without incurring significant expense or business disruption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One contract market commenter on the Commission's proposal stated that all registrants should have the opportunity
to use an interactive computer program. Since all of the contract markets are located in major metropolitan areas,
the Commission responded by expressing its belief that FTs and FBs will generally attend in-person training sessions
sponsored by a contract market. The Commission also indicated, however, that it ``may consider in its review of proposed
ethics training courses whether a particular proposal that includes an interactive computer program would be appropriate
for those whom attendance at an in-person session would not be unduly burdensome.''

Most of the persons authorized to provide ethics training to date currently do so by means of in-person presentation.
Originally, a firm authorized to provide such training by means of videotape or electronic presentation was required
to represent that videotape or electronic training would be limited to registrants who live in locations outside
those metropolitan areas where in-person training will be given and for those registrants that can provide a valid
excuse for their inability to attend sessions in those cities. The firm was further required to represent that it would
review all excuses given by registrants for being unable to attend an in-person program in their metropolitan areas
and would assure that each such registrant is unable to attend due to illness, vacation, business trips or other commitments
that genuinely precluded his presence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, the Commission's staff received several inquiries, both from existing ethics training providers
and potential new providers, concerning the offering of interactive training in lieu of in-person training where
locational or other factors rendering in-person training less feasible did not exist. The Commission has reviewed
this issue and believes that the previously required representations may be difficult to interpret and may prevent
the most economic means of compliance for firms with multiple, dispersed branches. Given the numbers of registrants,
it may also be more efficient and cost-effective to permit greater use of videotaped and interactive training, without
sacrificing the usefulness of such training, subject to the verification procedures described below. Accordingly,
the Commission is now of the view that any registrant may meet his ethics training requirement through in-person or
through videotaped or electronic presentations.

The Commission also wishes to make clear, however, that if videotaped or electronic training is offered, the provider
must be able to verify that the video has been viewed or the training completed by the registrant before the provider
issues a certificate of attendance to the registrant. Accordingly, if a provider will conduct training via videotape
or electronic presentation, either exclusively or in addition to in-person training, the Commission is proposing
that the provider's certification referred to above be supplemented to include a representation that the provider
will maintain documentation reasonably designed to verify that registrants have properly completed ethics training
for the minimum time required (one, two or four hours). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission envisages that an appropriate verification regime for a provider would include procedures such as
the following. The provider would maintain a list of the computer-based ethics program purchasers and match each
completed program with a record of purchase. Registrants would be required to enter identifying information, such
as name, firm's name, business address, telephone number, date of birth, NFA and/or Social Security number, on the
control diskette and return a signed statement with the completed computer diskette certifying that he did in fact
complete the ethics training course in the manner set out in the instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the fulfillment of the minimum time requirements and verification of the registrants' participation
in the program, the ethics training provider could use a computer-based test to assure that the registrant has attained
a minimum level of understanding of the materials covered, drawing upon matters covered in video and written materials,
as well as the computer program, to the extent applicable. Registrants would be required to pass each section of the
test prior to answering questions in later sections of the test to assure that each section of the program is completed.
While those who fail the test would be required to retake it until it is successfully completed, only the time spent
on the first test could be credited toward the ethics training time required by Rule 3.34. Registrants answering quickly
would be given additional questions to answer, and the program would cease recording elapsed time for those slow to
answer questions. Thus, registrants would be monitored both as to time spent and material covered.

If an ethics training provider develops a computer-based ethics training program for use by a particular registered
firm and its APs that in addition to the required subject matter also includes material tailored to that firm, such
as the firm's specific professional conduct policies, the ethics training provider could verify completion by the
APs by relying on the registered firm's representation as to its APs' attendance if the firm can verify the identity
of participants through the firm's in-house computer communication system or through monitoring by the firm's supervisory
or managerial staff. The ethics training provider should require registered firms using a tailored ethics training
program to furnish periodic reports of specified identifying information for each AP accessing the training program.

The Commission contemplates that an ethics training provider would be able to document that a registrant had undertaken

Rule 3.34(b)(4) governs recordkeeping by an ethics training provider. The Commission is proposing to add a provision
to the current recordkeeping requirements that would require providers of ethics training to furnish records of
attendees at such training to a registered futures association in such format as the registered futures association
may request. When the Commission adopted Rule 3.34, it required that providers of ethics training maintain records
of attendees at such training in accordance with Commission Rule 1.31, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for a five-year period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

ethics training attendance and may reconsider the issue at a later date if appropriate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission understands that NFA is willing to compile information on ethics training attendance for inclusion
in the registration database and believes that ethics training providers should cooperate with NFA requests for
the information which providers are already required to maintain. This will allow for a central repository of such
information which should benefit all registrants and facilitate oversight of compliance with the ethics training
requirement. To facilitate NFA's incorporation of this data in the registration database, ethics training providers
should include appropriate identifiers of registrants, such as NFA ID number, and follow other format conventions
requested by NFA.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules,
consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. The proposed rule amendments discussed herein will affect
ethics training providers, which include SROs, entities accredited to conduct continuing education programs by
a state professional licensing authority in the fields of law, finance, accounting or economics, and any other person
who complies with the requirements to be included on a list of ethics training providers. The SROs offering ethics
training to their members are the contract markets and the Commission has previously determined that contract markets
are not small entities under the RFA.

ethics training, the Commission believes that such impact will be minimal. The procedure for becoming an ethics training
provider would be simplified. The permissible representations by ethics training providers which the Commission
is proposing to codify are consistent with the statements set forth in Commission letters issued to date to ethics
training providers. Finally, since ethics training providers are already required to maintain records of attendees,
furnishing such information to NFA upon request should not cause an undue burden.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed regulations relating to the method of reporting for trusts which are treated as owned
by grantors or other persons under the provisions of subpart E (section 671 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter
1 of the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed regulations are intended to reduce the current filing burden on trustees,
to provide necessary information to grantors or other persons treated as the owners of trusts, to reduce any cases
of duplicate filing, and to provide more meaningful information to the IRS. The proposed regulations would affect
grantors and trustees of trusts that are treated as owned by grantors or other persons, as well as persons who are required
to file information returns with respect to payments to these trusts.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document proposes amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 671 and 6012 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code), and to the Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 6109 of
the Code. The proposed amendments are to be issued under the authority of section 7805 of the Code.

Reporting Requirements Under the Current Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In general, every fiduciary (which includes a trustee of a trust) must make a return of income on Form 1041. Under the
current regulations, items of income, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to any portion of a trust which is
treated as owned by the grantor or another person generally must be shown by the trustee on a separate statement attached
to a Form 1041, rather than on the form itself. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception applies when
the same individual is both grantor and trustee (or co-trustee) of the trust, and that individual is treated for the
taxable year as the owner of the entire trust under section 676 of the Code. The second exception applies when a husband

Section 301.6109&hyph;1(a)(2) of the current Regulations on Procedure and Administration provides that a grantor
trust reporting under one of these two exceptions shall not obtain an employer identification number until such time
as the reporting exceptions no longer apply to the trust. Instead, the grantor of such a trust must furnish his or her
social security number (or, when applicable, his or her employer identification number) to payors of income, and
payors must report income as if paid to the grantor, not the trust.

Reporting Requirements Under the Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulations will reduce the reporting burden on certain trustees by expanding the current exceptions
to the requirement of filing a Form 1041 to other trusts all of which are treated as owned by one or more grantors or other
persons. Thus, considerably more trustees will not be required to file a Form 1041.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations retain the general rule of the current regulations that items of income, deduction, and
credit attributable to any portion of a trust which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person must be reported
by the trustee on a separate statement attached to a Form 1041.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations, however, provide alternative methods of reporting for a trust 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, including a trust treated as owned by a person other
than an individual and a trust with a third-party trustee. Under these alternative methods, the trustee does not file
a Form 1041 with an attached statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the trust is treated as owned by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
one 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
grantor or other person, the trustee may choose between two alternative methods of reporting. The trustee must furnish
to all payors of income and proceeds during the taxable year either: (i) the name and taxpayer identification number
(TIN) of the grantor or other person, and the address of the trust; or (ii) the name, TIN, and address of the trust. If
the trust is treated as owned by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
more than one
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grantor or other person, the trustee must furnish the name, TIN, and address of the trust to all payors of income and
proceeds during the taxable year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the trustee furnishes the name and TIN of the grantor or other person and the address of the trust to all payors, the
trustee is not required to file any type of return with the IRS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the trustee furnishes the name, TIN, and address of the trust to all payors, the trustee must file with the IRS appropriate
Forms 1099 which: (1) report each type of income and each item of gross proceeds paid to the trust; (2) show the trust
as the payor; and (3) show each grantor or other person treated as an owner of the trust as the payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under all of the alternative methods of reporting, unless the trustee or co-trustee is also the only grantor or other
person treated as an owner of the trust, the trustee must furnish each grantor or other person with a statement that:
(1) shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust attributable to the grantor or other person for the
taxable year; (2) provides the grantor or other person with the information necessary to take the items into account
in computing the grantor's or other person's taxable income; and (3) states that all items of income or gross proceeds
that are required to be reported to the IRS have been included on the statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statement furnished by the trustee is not subject to the requirements set forth in Internal Revenue Service Publication
1179 (Specifications for Paper Document Reporting and Paper Substitutes for Forms 1096, 1098, 1099 Series, 5498,
and W&hyph;2G) for furnishing substitute statements to form recipients. When these proposed regulations are issued
as final, a conforming change will be made to Publication 1179.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of which TIN the trustee furnishes to payors, the payors will furnish statements to recipients to the trustee
of the trust, and not to the grantors or other persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes to the current regulations under sections 6012 and 6109 of the Code are also proposed.

Effective Date and Transition Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations are effective for taxable years beginning on or after the first day of the first calendar
year after the date of publication of the final regulations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, subject to a requirement that certain trustees file a final Form 1041 before adopting one of the alternative methods
of reporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed regulations provide that, for taxable years beginning prior to the effective date of the
proposed regulations, the IRS will not challenge the manner of reporting of certain trustees of trusts all of which
are treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons who did not report in accordance with &sect;1.671&hyph;4(a)
of the current regulations.

Special Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration for comment on their impact on small businesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday, September 21, 1994, at 1 p.m., in the IRS Auditorium, 7th floor,
1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond
the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts.

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
G creates an irrevocable trust which provides that the ordinary income is to be payable to him for life and that on his
death the corpus shall be distributed to B, an unrelated person. Except for the right to receive income, G retains no
right or power which would cause him to be treated as an owner under sections 671 through 677. Under the applicable local
law, capital gains must be added to corpus. Since G has a right to receive income, he is treated as an owner of a portion
of the trust under section 677. The tax consequences of any items of capital gain of the trust are governed by the provisions
of subparts A, B, C, and D (section 641 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Because not all of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor, the trustee may not report by the methods described in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

(i)(A) On January 1, 1995, G, a United States citizen, creates a revocable trust all of which is treated as owned by G.
The trustee of the trust is T. During the 1995 taxable year the trust has the following items of income and gross proceeds:

to the trust are A ($3,200) and B ($5). The payor of the gross proceeds from the sale of B stock is S ($2,000). The B stock
was purchased by T for $1,500 on January 2, 1995, and sold by T on November 30, 1995. T furnishes the name, TIN, and address
of the trust to X, Y, Z, A, B, and S. T timely files a Form 1099&hyph;INT with the Internal Revenue Service on which T reports
interest attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,500; a Form 1099&hyph;DIV on which T reports dividends
attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $3,205; and a Form 1099&hyph;B on which T reports proceeds from the sale
of B stock attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,000. On or before the date specified in section 6034A(a),
T furnishes a statement to G which lists the following items of income and information necessary for G to take the items
into account in computing G's taxable income:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Obtaining an employer identification number.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the trustee furnishes the name and taxpayer identification number of the grantor or other person and the address
of the trust to all payors pursuant to &sect;1.671- 4(b)(1)(i)(A) of this chapter, the trustee need not obtain an employer
identification number for the trust until the first taxable year of the trust in which the trust is no longer described
in &sect;1.671&hyph;4(b) of this chapter. If the trustee furnishes the name, taxpayer identification number, and
address of the trust to all payors pursuant to &sect;1.671&hyph;4 (b)(1)(i)(B) or (b)(2)(i) of this chapter, and
the trustee has not already obtained a taxpayer identification number for the trust, the trustee must obtain an employer

Any payors of income or proceeds that are required to file an information return with respect to payments of income
or proceeds to a trust must show the name and taxpayer identification number that the trustee has furnished to the payor
on the return. Regardless of whether the trustee furnishes to the payor the name and taxpayer identification number
of the grantor or other person, or the name and taxpayer identification number of the trust, the payor must furnish
a statement to recipients to the trustee of the trust, rather than to the grantor or other person. Under these circumstances,
the payor is considered to have satisfied any obligation to show the name and taxpayer identification number of the
payee on the information return and to furnish to the person whose taxpayer identification number is required to be
shown on the form a statement to recipients.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of South Dakota has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank program under Subtitle I of
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the South
Dakota application and has made the tentative decision that South Dakota's underground storage tank program satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. EPA intends to grant final approval to the State to
operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. The State of South Dakota's application for final approval is available
for public review and comment. EPA has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient
number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing to EPA or calling the contact within 30 days
of the date of publication of this notice, EPA will hold a hearing on the date given below in the ``DATES'' section. EPA
will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition, anyone who
wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the ``Contacts'' section below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state underground storage
tank programs to operate in the State in lieu of the Federal underground storage tank (UST) program. Program approval
is granted by EPA if the Agency finds that the State program: (1) is ``no less stringent'' than the Federal program in
all seven elements, and includes notification requirements of section 9004(a)(8), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2)
provides for adequate enforcement of compliance with UST standards (Section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)).

B. State of South Dakota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of South Dakota established authority through South Dakota Codified Law 34A&hyph;2&hyph;98 and 34A&hyph;2&hyph;99
to implement an underground storage tank program. The State developed and approved rules in the Administrative Rules
of South Dakota that became effective November 30, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 9, 1992, South Dakota submitted an official application for final approval. EPA reviewed and commented on
the application and requested additional information to be included in the final application. Prior to its submission,
South Dakota provided an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage
tank program as required under &sect;281.50(b). EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application, and has tentatively
determined that the State's program meets all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final approval to South Dakota to operate its program in lieu of the Federal program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative determination to approve the South Dakota UST program does not extend to ``Indian Country,'' as defined
in 18 U.S.C. Section 1151, including the following ``existing or former'' Indian reservations in the State of South
Dakota:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before EPA would be able to approve the State of South Dakota UST program for any portion of ``Indian Country,'' the
State would have to provide an appropriate analysis of the State's jurisdiction to enforce in these areas. In order
for a state to satisfy this requirement, it must demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that it had authority either
pursuant to explicit Congressional authorization or applicable principles of Federal Indian Law to enforce its
laws against existing and potential pollution sources within any geographical area for which it seeks program approval.
EPA has reason to believe that disagreement exists with regard to the State's jurisdiction over ``Indian Country,''
and EPA is not satisfied that South Dakota has, at this time, made the requisite showing of its authority with respect
to such lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In withholding program approval for these areas, EPA is not making a determination that the State either has adequate
jurisdiction or lacks such jurisdiction. Should the State of South Dakota choose to submit analysis with regard to
its jurisdiction over all or part of ``Indian Country'' in the State, it may do so without prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's future evaluation of whether to approve the South Dakota program for ``Indian Country,'' to include Indian
reservation lands, will be governed by EPA's judgment as to whether the State has demonstrated adequate authority
to justify such approval, based upon its understanding of the relevant principles of Federal Indian law and sound
administrative practice. The State may wish to consider EPA's discussion of the related issue of tribal jurisdiction
found in the preamble to the Indian Water Quality Standards Regulation (see 56 FR 64876, December 12, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 2, 1994, the State of South Dakota submitted to EPA an amendment to its UST program application. The amendment
requests that South Dakota UST program approval be expanded to include UST activities on non-Indian lands for the
former lands of the Yankton Sioux, Lake Traverse (Sisseton-Wahpeton) and parts of the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations.
This amendment is presently being reviewed by EPA and will be treated as a revision to the South Dakota UST program proposed
for approval today. A notice of the proposed EPA decision on this amendment will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Section 9004 of RCRA 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR 281.50(e), the Agency will accept written comments
on EPA's tentative determination until August 21, 1994. Copies of South Dakota's application are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the

EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period.
Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to South Dakota. EPA expects to
make a final decision on whether or not to approve South Dakota's program by October 20, 1994 and will give notice of
it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. At this time, EPA and the State will enter into a memorandum of agreement to set forth the manner in which the State and
EPA will coordinate the State's administration of the State program. The notice will include a summary of the reasons
for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of South Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners
and operators of underground storage tanks in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility
analysis.

This document gives notice of the proposed revision of the DOL's regulations governing administrative claims submitted
to DOL pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act
(MPCECA), and for payment of claims arising out of the operation of the Job Corps. These regulations are being revised
to reflect previous delegations of authority to the Counsel for Claims and to the Regional Solicitors and Associate
Regional Solicitors to issue determinations on claims under the statutes covered by these regulations, to clarify
the manner in which organizational units of the Department provide administrative assistance to the Office of the
Solicitor in regard to claims and litigation under these statutes and to clarify and provide further examples of the
manner in which MPCECA claims are submitted and determined. The regulations are also being amended to reflect a change
in statutory authority for payment of claims arising out of operation of the Job Corps.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) surrenders the sovereign immunity of the United States for the negligent or wrongful
act or omission of a Government employee acting within the scope of his or her employment. The Military Personnel and
Civilian Employees' Claims Act (MPCECA) authorizes payment of claims of employees of the Government for loss of,
or damage to, property incident to Government service. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) authorizes payment
of claims arising out of the operation of the Job Corps that are not cognizable under the FTCA. Part 15 of title 29 of the
Code of Federal Regulations currently contains regulations implementing these three claims authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A of part 15 sets forth regulations for claims under the FTCA. It is being revised to reflect previous delegations
of authority to the Counsel for Claims to issue determinations of claims seeking damages in amounts exceeding $25,000
and to the Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors to issue determinations of claims that arose within
their jurisdictions seeking damages in amounts up to $25,000. Subpart A is also being amended to provide that all FTCA
claims for amounts up to $25,000 should be filed with the official duty station of the employee whose act or omission
forms the basis of the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A is also being amended to clarify and provide specific directions concerning the manner in which organizational
units of the Department provide assistance to the Office of the Solicitor in regard to FTCA claims and litigation.
A number of non-substantive editorial changes are also being made to the language of these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B of part 15 sets forth regulations for claims under the MPCECA. It is being revised to reflect previous delegations
of authority to the Counsel for Claims and to the Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors. It is also
being revised to reflect an amendment to the MPCECA increasing the maximum amount payable on a claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B is being amended to clarify the manner in which claims are submitted and calculated and to provide further
illustrations of allowable claims and those not allowable under the MPCECA. Thus, provisions are being added clarifying
that both filing of a claim and determination of a claim must be in writing and that a claim is not required to contain
a demand for a specific sum of money. Each MPCECA claimant will be required to provide a statement from his or her immediate
supervisor that possession of the property in question was reasonable, useful or proper and its loss or damage was
incident to service. Additional examples of property for which reimbursement is not available are being added such
as intangible property, real property and commercial property. A provision is also being added to recognize that
claimants may be reimbursed for any sales tax incurred in connection with the repair of an item.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B is being revised to exclude payment for loss of, or damage to, cellular telephones, fax machines, computers
and related hardware and software, unless the loss is incident to fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster
or by theft from authorized quarters (as limited by &sect;15.13(c)(1)) or unless it is being shipped as part of a change
in duty station paid for by the Department. Subpart B is also being revised to provide that an alternative work location
at which an employee is performing duties pursuant to an approved Flexiplace agreement shall be considered an official
duty station for purposes of this subtitle. The minimum amount of loss necessary to have a claim allowed is being raised
from $10 to $25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B is also being amended to provide that at the discretion of the official involved, a claimant may be required
to turn over to the United States an item alleged to have been damaged beyond economical repair and to provide that current
replacement cost and depreciated value are to be determined by use of publicly available adjustment rates or through
use of other reasonable methods at the discretion of the deciding official. A number of non-substantive editorial
changes are also being made to the language of subpart B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart C is being revised to reflect a change in the statutory authority for claims arising out of the operation of
the Job Corps from the Comprehensive Training and Employment Act of 1973 to the JTPA. It also is being revised to reflect
previous delegations of authority to the Regional Solicitors and Associate Regional Solicitors and to clarify the
manner in which a claim is submitted. Subpart C is also being revised to provide that the determination of a claim shall
be provided to the claimant in writing. A number of non-substantive editorial changes are also being made to the language
of subpart C.

Claims involving carriers or insurers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event the property which is the subject of the claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a commercial
carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the
owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled
the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the
terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Whenever property is damaged, lost or destroyed incident to the claimant's service and is insured in whole or in
part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under the terms and conditions
of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the claim against the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights
available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result
in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from
the carrier or insurer had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where
the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution,
or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit his
claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final
approval or denial of the claim is made by the carrier or insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Upon submitting his or her claim, the claimant shall certify in his claim that he or she has or has not gained any recovery
from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If final action has not been taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim, the claimant shall immediately notify
them to address all correspondence in regard to the claim to the appropriate Office of the Solicitor of Labor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claimant shall advise the appropriate Office of the Solicitor of any action taken by the carrier or insurer
on the claim and, upon request, shall furnish all correspondence, documents, and other evidence pertinent to the
matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The claimant shall assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment on the claim accepted by him or her, all
rights, title and interest in any claim he or she may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of
the incident on which the claim against the United States is based. After payment of the claim by the United States,
the claimant shall, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the
extent of the payment received by him or her from the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Where a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before his or her claim under this subpart is settled,
the amount or recovery shall be applied to the claim as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's
total loss as determined under this part, no compensation is allowable under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery
from the amount of such total loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For this purpose, the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the maximum payment limitations
set forth in &sect;15.11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds the maximum payment limitations, the claimant
shall be allowed only the maximum amount set forth in &sect;15.11.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes changes to the systems and equipment airworthiness standards for normal, utility, acrobatic,
and commuter category airplanes. These proposals arise from the joint effort of the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) to harmonize the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and
the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) for airplanes that will be certificated in these categories. The proposed
changes would provide nearly uniform systems and equipment airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated
in the United States under 14 CFR part 23 (part 23) and in the JAA countries under Joint Aviation Requirements 23 (JAR
23), thereby simplifying airworthiness approval for import and export purposes.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At the June 1990 meeting of the JAA Council (consisting of JAA members from European countries) and the FAA, the FAA
Administrator committed the FAA to support the harmonization of the FAR with the JAR being developed for use by the
European authorities who are members of the JAA. In response to this commitment, the FAA Small Airplane Directorate
established an FAA Harmonization Task Force to work with the JAR 23 Study Group to harmonize part 23 and the proposed
JAR 23. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) also established a JAR 23/part 23 Committee to provide
technical assistance in this effort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the first draft of proposed JAR 23, members of the FAA Harmonization Task Force and the GAMA Committee
met in Brussels, Belgium for the October 1990 meeting of the JAR 23 Study Group. Representatives from the Association
Europeene des Constructeures de Material Aerospatial (AECMA), an organization of European airframe manufacturers,
also attended. The main agenda item for this meeting was the establishment of procedures to accomplish harmonization
of the airworthiness standards for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes. The JAA had decided that its
initial rulemaking effort should be limited to these three categories and that commuter category airworthiness
standards should be addressed separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After that meeting, technical representatives from each of the four organizations (GAMA, AECMA, FAA and JAA) met
to resolve differences between the proposed JAR and part 23. This portion of the harmonization effort involved a number
of separate meetings of specialists in the flight, airframe, powerplant, and systems disciplines. These meetings
showed that harmonization would require revisions to both part 23 and the proposed JAR 23.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Near the end of the effort to harmonize the normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplane airworthiness standards,
the JAA requested and received recommendations from its member countries on proposed airworthiness standards for
commuter category airplanes. The JAA and the FAA held specialist and study group meetings to discuss these recommendations,
which resulted in proposals to revise portions of the part 23 commuter category airworthiness standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the European rules, where commuter category airworthiness standards are separate, for U.S. rulemaking,
it is advantageous to adopt normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airworthiness standards simultaneously,
since commuter category airworthiness standards are already contained in part 23. Accordingly, this NPRM proposes
to revise the systems and equipment airworthiness standards for all part 23 airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the part 23 harmonization effort, the FAA established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991), which held its first meeting on May 23, 1991. The ARAC on General Aviation and Business Airplane
(GABA) Issues was established at that meeting to provide advice and recommendations to the Director, Aircraft Certification
Service, FAA, regarding the airworthiness standards in part 23 as well as related provisions of parts 91 and 135 of
the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA announced, on June 2&hyph;5, 1992, at the JAA/FAA Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the JAR and the FAR. Coinciding
with that announcement, the FAA assigned the ARAC on GABA Issues those rulemaking projects related to JAR/part 23
harmonization that were in final coordination between the JAA and the FAA. The harmonization process included the
intention to present the results of JAA/FAA coordination to the public as NPRM's. Subsequently, the ARAC on GABA Issues
established an ARAC&hyph;JAR 23 Study Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JAR 23 Study Group made recommendations to the ARAC on GABA Issues concerning the FAA disposition of the rulemaking
issues coordinated between the JAA and the FAA. The draft NPRMs previously prepared by the FAA harmonization team
were made available to the harmonization working group to assist them in their effort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of the formation of the JAR 23 Harmonization Working Group was published on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56626).
The group held its first meeting on February 2, 1993. These efforts resulted in the proposals for systems and equipment
airworthiness standards contained in this notice. The ARAC on GABA Issues agreed with these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received unsolicited comments from the JAA dated January 20, 1994, concerning issues that were left unresolved
with the JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group did not address some of the unresolved issues
because the JAA had not yet reached positions on those issues. Unresolved issues will be dealt with at future FAR/JAR
Harmonization meetings. With respect to other issues unresolved by the JAR 23 Study Group, the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization
Working Group recommendations did not reflect harmonization, but reflected the technical discussion of the merits
of each issue that had been thoroughly debated at the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization meetings. (The Working Group Chairperson
had been present at the Harmonization meetings.) The JAA comments have been placed in the docket for this proposal,
and will be considered along with those received during the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following completion of these harmonization efforts, the FAA determined that the proposed revisions to part 23 were
too numerous for a single NPRM. The FAA decided to simplify the issues by issuing four NPRM's. These NPRM's address
the airworthiness standards in the specific areas of systems and equipment, powerplant, flight, and airframe. These
NPRM's propose changes in all seven subparts of part 23. Since there is some overlap, interested persons are advised
to review all four NPRM's to identify all proposed changes to a particular section.

Section 23.677&blank;Trim Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed revised &sect;23.677(a) would clarify the need to mark the lateral and directional trim indicators with
the neutral trim position. Since trim indicators on most airplanes are currently marked with the neutral position
of the trimming device, this proposal would standardize the cockpit markings for all airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised paragraph (a) would also add a requirement for the pitch trim indicator to be marked with the proper pitch trim
range for the takeoff of the airplane. Some takeoff accidents, including some involving fatalities, have occurred
because the pitch trim was not set to the proper range needed for the airplane takeoff. Because of this accident experience,
most of the current airplane manufacturers mark the pitch trim indicator with the pitch trim range for takeoff. Therefore,
the proposed marking requirement would not have a significant impact on future airplane designs and would ensure
that the markings needed for a safe takeoff are provided for the pilots' use.

Section 23.691&blank;Artificial Stall Barrier System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed new section would provide standards for stall barrier systems if a stall barrier is necessary to show
compliance with &sect;23.201(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of &sect;23.201(c) provide criteria for the in-flight demonstration of wings level stall. The
requirements also specify the means of identifying when a stall has occurred. Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 (58 FR 42136,
August 6, 1993) revised &sect;23.201(c) by adding the activation of an artificial stall barrier as an acceptable
means of identifying when a stall has occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the technology of airplane designs improved and engines with increased power became available, airplanes were
developed that did not meet the older wings level stall requirement of &sect;23.201. Consequently, these airplanes
were equipped with an artificial stall barrier that moved the airplane elevator controls and caused a nose down pitching
motion similar to the pitching motion of airplanes that meet the wings level stall requirement of &sect;23.201. The
manufacturer selected the airspeed where this pitching motion occurred and flight testing established compliance
with the other flight regulations at airspeeds above the speed selected for the push. These stall barrier systems
are commonly called ``stick pushers.'' Such systems have been accepted for compliance with &sect;23.201 under the
equivalent safety provisions of &sect;21.21(b)(1), since they provide a pitch motion that is equivalent to that
experienced during stalls of airplanes that meet the stall requirements of &sect;23.201. Appropriate compliance
with other applicable requirements of part 23 has been established by other design characteristics of the stall barrier
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of the proposed new section are based on system design characteristics necessary to ensure the safe
operation of previously approved stall barrier systems. The proposed section also requires such systems to include
provisions to prevent unwanted activation of the stall barrier systems. This is necessary to ensure that such systems
do not cause downward pitching motions at higher airspeeds when such pitching could be unsafe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed sections would basically codify those provisions that have been found necessary for approving stick
pusher systems under the equivalent safety requirements of &sect;21.21(b)(1). Therefore, in effect, no new requirements
would be added by this proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new section would be applicable only to airplanes with flight characteristics that need an artificial
stall barrier system to ensure safe operation of that airplane. Including provision for the installation of an optional
stick pusher system would relieve the manufacturer of the financial burden that would be needed to redesign the airplane
so that it would meet the wings level stall requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.697(c) would provide safety standards for the wing flap control lever designs installed in
airplanes that use wing flap settings other than fully retracted when showing compliance with &sect;23.145. This
revision is needed to ensure that the flap settings, which establish the safe operation of the airplane, can be positively
selected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to clarify the requirements for flap systems installed on part 23
airplanes. Following the revision of &sect;23.701, as adopted by Amendment No. 23&hyph;42 (56 FR 353, January 3,
1991), the FAA discovered that the new requirements could be interpreted in a way that was not intended and that this
interpretation could result in approval of airplanes with unsafe flight characteristics in the event of flap failure.
To clarify the intent of the requirements, the FAA issued on March 14, 1991, a policy letter to all aircraft certification
offices that provided guidance for the correct application of the requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since then, the FAA has reexamined the requirements and determined that &sect;23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) need to be
revised to ensure that a failure of the flap system would not create an asymmetric flap configuration that could result
in an unsafe flight condition. Therefore, &sect;23.701 (a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to clarify that one of the
following would apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The moveable flap surfaces must be synchronized by a mechanical interconnection or by an approved equivalent
means, that is independent of the flap drive system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The wing flap system must be designed so that any failures of the flap system that would result in an unsafe flight
characteristic of the airplane, such as flap asymmetry, is extremely improbable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revisions would ensure that a failure of the flap drive systems will not result in a flap asymmetry configuration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed new section would require a takeoff warning system on some commuter category airplanes. The requirement
would be applicable if the flight evaluation showed that an unsafe takeoff condition would result if lift devices
or longitudinal trim devices are set to any position outside the approved takeoff range. If the evaluation shows that
no unsafe condition would result at any setting of these devices, a takeoff warning system would not be required. For
those airplanes on which a warning system must be installed, the proposal would provide requirements for the installation
of the system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.729(e) to clarify that a landing gear indicator is required for each gear. The
last sentence of current &sect;23.729(e) would also be removed. This sentence, which states that the switches may
be located where they are operated by the actual landing gear locking latch or device, is advisory material and should
not be included in the requirements. If future guidance is needed to identify acceptable switch locations, Advisory
Circular 23.701&hyph;1 will be revised to include that information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would also add a new &sect;23.729(g) requiring that if the landing gear bay is used as the location for
equipment other than landing gear, the equipment must be designed and installed to minimize damage. On larger airplanes,
such as the commuter category, a primary cause of damage to such equipment would be tire burst. In addition, service
history has shown that rocks, water, and slush enter the landing gear bay and cause damage. The equipment on any size
airplane should be protected from damage by such external sources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.735(a) would be revised to state plainly that wheel brakes must be provided. A proposed new &sect;23.735(c)
would require the brake system to be designed so that the brake manufacturer's specified brake pressures are not exceeded
during the landing distance determination required by &sect;23.75.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.735(e), applicable to commuter category airplanes, would require establishing the minimum
rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly. Section 23.45 provides
that the determination of the accelerate-stop distance for commuter category airplanes be made in accordance with
the applicant's procedures for operation in service. The proposed requirement is needed to ensure that the brakes
will perform safely under accelerate-stop conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.745 would provide requirements that apply if nose/tail-wheel steering is installed. Advanced
airplane design technology, along with the need to safely control the airplane when it is being operated on increasingly
congested airports, has resulted in several small airplanes being equipped with systems for ground steering only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new section would not require the installation of a system for ground steering, but it would add requirements
to define how such a system should function if one is installed. It would also require the steering system to be designed
so that it will not interfere with any installed landing gear retraction and extension system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.775(a) would be revised to state that internal glass panels of windshields and windows must be constructed
of a nonsplintering material, such as nonsplintering glass. Currently &sect;23.775(a) requires nonsplintering
safety glass only. A nonsplintering material must be used to protect pilots from injury. While nonsplintering glass
is an acceptable standard, other nonsplintering materials would be allowed under the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.775(c) would be revised to clarify that it applies to pressurized airplanes if certification for operation
up to and including 25,000 feet is requested. This would not be a substantive change. It has always applied to such airplanes
but is not as directly stated in the current rule as it would be in the proposed rule. Current &sect;23.775(e), which
is being redesignated as &sect;23.775(d) by this notice without change, provides requirements for airplanes that
are certified for operations above 25,000 feet. This revision of paragraph (c) and redesignation of paragraph (e)
will clarify the requirements that are applicable to airplanes approved for operations at different altitudes.
Redesignated paragraph (e) is revised to remove the masculine gender by rephrasing ``when he is seated'' to read ``when
the pilot is seated.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.775(h), introductory text, and paragraph (h)(1) would be added to require windshield panes of commuter
category airplanes that are directly in front of the pilots to withstand the impact of a two pound bird. This requirement
is based on a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation to add windshield bird strike protection for commuter category
airplanes. Following receipt of the recommendations, the FAA obtained and reviewed the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) data on bird strikes that occurred on airplanes of 19,000 pounds or less from 1981 through 1989.
These data show that approximately 550 strikes occurred and that one out of seven strikes hit the windshield. The bird
strike reports, which include information on the type of bird, the airplane altitude and/or airspeed, show the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. More than one-half of the strikes (51.8 percent) occurred between the ground and 100 feet above the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Another one-fourth of the strikes (26.7 percent) occurred between 101 and 1000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The airplane airspeed at the time of most of the strikes (85 percent) was 150 knots or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Where bird types were reported, 27.6 percent involved small birds and 58.6 involved medium size birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Incidents where the airplane was damaged showed that 16.9 percent resulted from small bird strikes and 64 percent
resulted from strikes involving medium size birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation of these data indicate that most bird strikes occur at takeoff and landing altitudes and airspeeds, and
that medium or small birds, many weighing two pounds or less, are most often struck. Although only a few fatalities
and injuries have resulted from these reported bird strikes, the data indicates a high probability of bird strikes
during landings and takeoffs and the potential hazards of such strikes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed new paragraph would require that the windshield panes directly in front of the pilots of commuter category
airplanes, and the supportive structure for these panes, must withstand the impact of a two-pound bird at an airplane's
maximum approach flap speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.775(h)(2) would require the panels of the windshield to be arranged so that, if one is damaged,
other panels will remain that will provide visibility for continuous safe flight and landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By requiring full protection against the strike of a two-pound bird at approach speeds, some protection will also
be provided if the airplane strikes a larger bird or strikes a bird at a higher speed.

other items, such as hot deicer surfaces or sharp objects on the airplane structure, are also hazards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 23.787 would be revised by extending the present requirements for cargo compartments to baggage compartments.
As proposed, future baggage compartments on all airplane categories would be required to: Be placarded for their
maximum weight capacity; have a means to prevent the baggage from shifting; and have a means to protect controls, wiring,
lines, and equipment or accessories that are located in the compartment and whose damage or failure would affect safe
operation of the airplane. These standards have been applicable to cargo compartment designs for some time and should
be applied to baggage compartments since the same safety factors are involved. Because manufacturers recognize
the need for these standards, many of these provisions have been included in the current design of baggage compartments
and, therefore, the proposed requirements are not expected to create a significant burden. With this revision the
commuter category requirements of &sect;23.787(g) would be redundant and that requirement is being removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed revisions to this section would also move the substance of paragraphs (d) and (f) to a proposed new &sect;23.855,
which will address cargo and baggage compartment fire protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (c) of this section would require flight crew emergency exits on all cargo configured airplanes
to meet the requirements of &sect;23.807. This requirement would provide increased assurance that flight crews
of all cargo airplanes will have ready access to an emergency exit.

door. (See discussion for proposed &sect;23.783 in this notice.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision of &sect;23.807(b) would provide that the inside handles of emergency exits that open outward
must be protected against inadvertent operation. Currently this protection is required by applying the general
safety provisions of this subchapter. The addition of the specific requirement in &sect;23.807(b) would clarify
the need for this protection by providing a requirement that addresses outward opening emergency exits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;23.807(b)(5) and new &sect;23.807(b)(6) would apply to acrobatic and utility category
airplanes that are approved for maneuvers, such a spinning. The proposed rule would require that emergency exits
for these category airplanes allow the occupants to abandon the airplane at certain speeds related to such maneuvers.
These emergency exits need to function under different environmental conditions than the emergency exits on normal
category airplanes. The revision of the text in paragraph (b)(5) would provide the same terminology that is used in
added new paragraph (b)(6).

feet. Current 14 CFR part 25, JAR 25, and proposed JAR 23 include the same requirement as this proposal. This proposed
requirement is intended to protect the airplane occupants from harm if a malfunction occurs at altitudes where symptoms
of hypoxia occur, usually above 25,000 feet. Due to the increasing use of turbine powered engines, more part 23 airplanes
will be approved for operations above 25,000 feet, thus exposing an increasing number or occupants, who may have some
breathing difficulties, to these altitudes. The occupants should have the same protection provided by the airworthiness
standards of part 25 and JAR 25.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed new paragraph (c) would add new fire protection requirements for cargo and baggage compartments for commuter
category airplanes. The proposed rule would require on of the following alternatives: (1) Either the compartment
must be located where pilots seated at their duty station would easily discover the fire or the compartment must be
equipped with a smoke or fire detector system to warn the pilot's station. The compartment must also provide access
to the compartment with a fire extinguisher. (2) The compartment may be inaccessible, but must be equipped with a fire
detector system that warns the pilot station, and the compartment must have ceiling and sidewall floor panels constructed
of materials that have been subjected to and meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F of this part.
(3) The compartment must be constructed and sealed to contain any fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new section is necessary for several reasons. The proposals for additional requirements for commuter
category airplane cargo and baggage compartments were developed after an examination of reported incidents of inflight
fires and their causes. Although most of these incidents of inflight fires occurred on transport category airplanes,
the reported sources of the fires showed that the fires originate from sources, such as matches in the pockets of clothing,
that are as likely to be found on part 23 airplanes as on transport category airplanes. The same potential for inflight
fires exists on commuter category airplanes and adequate protection should be provided.

The potential for inflight fires also showed a need to examine the flame resistant requirements of current &sect;23.787(d)
and to consider requirements that would improve the fire protection on other categories of airplanes. As a part of
this consideration, fire protection was discussed with certain airframe manufacturing representatives. Information
provided in these discussions showed that materials that meet self-extinguishing flame requirements are available
at about the same cost as materials that meet flame resistance requirements. Based on a review of the fire incidents
and the information on availability of improved materials, the proposal for &sect;23.855(b), which would replace
current &sect;23.787(d), would require self-extinguishing materials to be used in the cargo and baggage compartments
of all part 23 airplanes.

The lead in for &sect;23.1303(a) would be revised to clarify that the instruments required by this section are the
minimum ones required. Also, &sect;23.1303(d) would add a requirement for those airplanes whose performance must
be based on weight, altitude, and temperature to be equipped with a free air temperature indicator. A new sentence
added to &sect;23.1303(e)(2) would state that nuisance overspeed warnings should not occur at lower speeds where
pilots might ignore the warning. A new paragraph (f) would propose requirements for attitude instruments that include
a means for flightcrew members to adjust the reference symbol. Finally, it would add a new paragraph (g) to define certain
specific instruments required for a commuter category airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal for &sect;23.1303(e)(2) was developed following a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation that the

, but that the design changes needed to ensure that the warning occurred between the presently required upper limit
and the recommended lower limit would be very expensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA notes that no known safety problem justifies that cost of these design changes. However, the FAA is also aware
that if warnings of any type occur when the pilots know that no particular problem exists, such warnings may become
a nuisance. If warnings become a nuisance, a pilot may disregard a warning when the airplane is approaching a flight
speed where an unsafe flight condition may occur. Regulatory action is therefore needed to ensure that the warning
will occur within appropriate speed limits. Proposed &sect;23.1303(e)(2) would require manufacturers to establish
a lower speed limit so that nuisance overspeed warnings will not occur. The manufacturer would be required to show
that this limit is appropriate for the airplane design but would not be required to set this lower limit at one specific
speed, such as V

A new &sect;23.1303(f) is proposed because attitude instruments are available that provide a means accessible to
the flightcrew members, for adjusting the reference symbol through ranges that could result in unsafe pitch angles
in small airplanes. These instruments were developed for airplanes that use high pitch angles for approved climb
or descent gradients. By permitting these airplanes to use instruments that can be adjusted for these higher pitch
angles, pilots are able to maintain the design gradients using an instrument that provides a normal indication at
that pitch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such attitude instruments are installed in small airplanes, pilots could adjust the reference symbol to ranges
that could result in unsafe pitch angles. The recommendation showed that some instruments can be adjusted to result
in pitch angles that are nearly the same as the pitch angle that many small airplanes achieve before stalling. To preclude
potential cases of unwanted pitch adjustments of attitude instruments installed in small airplanes, &sect;23.1303(f)
proposes to limit the adjustment range to that limit that is needed for parallax correction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1303(g) would identify specific instruments, and limits of those instruments, required
for commuter category airplanes. When the JAA initiated their consideration of commuter category airplanes, one
of the proposals they received recommended adding the instrument requirements of &sect;25.1303 to part 23 for commuter
category airplanes. In considering this recommendation, a review of the requirements showed that many instruments
required under &sect;25.1303 are presently required by the operating rules. In addition, &sect;23.1583(h) requires
a list of the equipment that must be installed for the kinds of operation for which the airplane is approved. Based on
the review, it was determined that many of the requirements in &sect;25.1303 would be redundant, and the recommendation
was not accepted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering a portion of the recommendation to require a third attitude instrument, the FAA noted that &sect;91.531(a)(3)
requires a commuter category airplane of ten or more passengers to be operated with a second-in-command and that &sect;23.1321
requires flight and navigation instruments for each required pilot. Accordingly, two attitude instruments are
required for a ten passenger, IFR approved commuter category airplane. Service experience has shown that failures
of an attitude instrument system can occur where there will be a time period in which the indicator appears to be working
but is providing incorrect information. During such a failure of one instrument in an airplane equipped with only
two instruments, the pilots may have difficulty determining which instrument to follow, and hazardous flight attitudes
may result. A third attitude instrument would allow the crew to retain reliable attitude information at all times,
and thus the proposed rule would require a third attitude instrument for commuter airplanes operated by two pilots.

Proposed new &sect;23.1309(a)(4) would correct an inadvertent omission that occurred when the FAA issued Amendment

a portion of &sect;23.1309(d) and read: ``In addition, for commuter category airplanes, system and installations
must be designed to safeguard against hazards to the airplane in the event of their malfunction or failure.'' (52 FR
1833, January 15, 1987.) To correct this oversight, and to continue the single fault provision of this paragraph,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.1311 to remove redundant requirements and to clarify which secondary instruments
are required and the visibility requirements for these instruments. When &sect;23.1311 was adopted by Amendment
No. 23&hyph;41 (55 FR 43306, October 26, 1990), several nonsubstantive changes were made to the proposals in Notice
No. 89&hyph;6 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) to remove the redundancy included in the notice. In the process certain provisions,
such as the one that permitted the installation of mechanical secondary instruments, were inadvertently omitted
from the final rule. Since the final rule, discussions with airplane manufacturer representatives have shown that
the requirements defining the instrument panel location where secondary instruments may be installed are also not
clear. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing to revise this section to correct and clarify these portions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1311(a), which requires electronic display indicator installations that are independent to
each pilot station, would be deleted because it is redundant with &sect;23.1321(a). Section 23.1321(a) requires
that each flight, navigation, and powerplant instrument for use by any required pilot shall be located so that any
pilot seated at the controls can monitor the instruments with minimum head and eye movement. As stated in the preamble
of Notice No. 89&hyph;6 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) regarding the proposed revision to &sect;23.1321, ``This revision
also clarifies the rule relative to instrumentation that must be provided for each pilot required for type certification
or by the applicable operating rules. If a pilot is required by any applicable requirement, then that pilot must be
provided all instrumentation required for any operations for which the airplane is approved.'' Accordingly, the
requirements of current &sect;23.1311(a) would be removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In place of current paragraph (a), proposed &sect;23.1311(a) would be a revision of current paragraph (c) that would
clarify what instruments are required and the visibility of those instruments. Proposed new &sect;23.1311(a)(1)
would require electronic display instrument installations to meet the arrangement and visibility requirements
of &sect;23.1321(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1311(a) (2), (3), and (4) would be redesignated with no changes from current &sect;23.1311(c)
(1), (2), and (3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) would continue the requirement of &sect;23.1303(c) for a magnetic direction indicator
and, in addition, would require either an independent secondary mechanical altimeter, airspeed indicator, and
attitude indicator or individual electronic display indicators for the altimeter, airspeed, and attitude that
are independent from the airplane's primary electrical power. These secondary instruments may be installed in panel
positions other than the primary location as long as the selected location allows the pilot to properly monitor the
instruments and control the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substance of proposed paragraph (a)(5) is both a substantive change and a combination of the current &sect;23.1311(b),
which states that certain electronic display indicators must be independent of the airplane's electrical power
system, and current &sect;23.1311(c)(4) which requires independent secondary attitude and rate-of-turn instruments
and specifies the location of those instruments. Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) would delete the requirement for
a rate-of-turn instrument (in current &sect;23.1311(c)(4)) and specify that the required secondary instruments
are those that provide altitude, airspeed, magnetic direction, and attitude. The information that would be provided
by a secondary rate-of-turn instrument would not appreciably add to the safe operations of the airplane if the pilot
has the information provided by the secondary attitude instrument.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1311(b) requires that electronic display indicators required by &sect;23.1303 (a), (b), and
(c) be independent of the airplane's electrical power system. The original intent of the requirement for secondary
instruments, as stated in Notice No. 89&hyph;6, was to require the installation of either mechanical instruments
or independent electronic display indicators powered by a source independent of the airplane's electrical system.
However, the current rule does not clearly state this and does not address the installation of mechanical instruments.
Proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5), would allow either secondary electronic display indicators or mechanical instruments
to provide a crew with information essential for continued flight and landing in the event of failure in the airplane's
electrical power system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed new &sect;23.1323(c) would add a requirement that each airspeed indicating system design and installation
should provide positive drainage of moisture from the system. This proposal is consistent with the provisions required
for a static system by &sect;23.1325(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If moisture enters, or accumulates in, an airspeed indicating system, that moisture could cause erroneous airspeed
indications or the complete loss of airspeed information. The resulting loss of accurate airspeed information would
be hazardous to the operation of the airplane; therefore, to assure the safety of the airplane, the FAA would need to
apply the more general airworthiness requirements of &sect;&sect;23.1301 and 23.1309 to such a system and require
provisions for drainage of moisture. Accordingly, this proposed revision of the airspeed indicating systems requirements
only clarifies the criteria that must be applied to airspeed indicating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To better organize the requirements that are applicable to the airspeed systems on all airplane categories and those
that would be additional requirements for the airspeed systems of commuter category airplanes, the FAA proposes
to redesignate existing paragraphs (c) and (e), respectively, as paragraphs (e) and (d). By this redesignation,
paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) would apply to all airplanes, and paragraphs (e) and (f) would include additional
requirements applicable to commuter category airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal for redesignated paragraph (e) would also remove the words ``in flight and'' from the first sentence
of that paragraph. This would remove the requirement for the airspeed indicating system to be calibrated in flight.
The requirement for an in flight calibration is provided in paragraph (b). Proposed redesignated paragraph (e) would
apply to the calibration needed to determine the system error during the accelerate-takeoff ground run.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As identified in the background section of this notice, the FAA is issuing additional notices that address proposed
changes to the requirements for powerplant, flight, and airframe. Proposed revisions to subpart G in the flight NPRM
include placing all of the requirements for what must appear in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) in that subpart. With
the proposals to revise the AFM requirements, the flight NPRM also proposes that the requirement in existing &sect;23.1323(d)
(to show the relationship between IAS and CAS in the AFM) be added to &sect;23.1587 as proposed new paragraph (d)(10).
Because the AFM requirement would be added to &sect;23.1587, it no longer needs to appear in &sect;23.1323. Accordingly,
this notice proposes to remove the text of existing &sect;23.1323(d).

Current &sect;23.1325(b)(3) establishes certain static pressure system requirements for airplanes that encounter
icy conditions. Current &sect;23.1325(g) exempts from the requirements of (b)(3) airplanes that are prohibited
from flight in instrument meteorological conditions in accordance with &sect;23.1559(b). After the adoption of
&sect;23.1325(g), it came to the FAA's attention that there are conditions other than instrument meteorological
conditions where icing may be encountered and, therefore, that this paragraph should also exempt from the provisions
of &sect;23.1325(b)(3) airplanes that are prohibited from flight in icing conditions. Accordingly, &sect;23.1325(g)
would be revised to read, ``For airplanes prohibited from flight in instrument meteorological or icing conditions.''

Proposed new &sect;23.1326 would require the installation of a pitot tube heat indicating system on those airplanes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to advancements in technology, many part 23 airplane installations now utilize equipment whose data sources
are critical to the accurate and dependable operation of that equipment. The heated pitot tube is one such data source.
The pitot heat indicating system will advise the pilots of any inoperative heating element in the pitot tube and that
subsequent inaccuracies may result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 23 airplanes certificated for flight under instrument flight rules or for flight in icing conditions are required
by current &sect;23.1323(e) to have a heated pitot system or an equivalent means of preventing an airspeed indicating
system malfunction due to ice accumulation. This proposal would require such airplanes equipped with a heated pitot
tube to be equipped with a pitot tube heat indicating system. This requirement will provide greater assurance that
the pilots will not be dangerously misled by faulty flight instrument indications caused by pitot tube icing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When pitot tube heat indicating system requirements were added to part 25, the FAA noted the occurrence of at least
one accident and several incidents in which an airspeed indicating error occurred that might have been avoided if
a pitot tube heat indicating system had been installed. Part 23 airplanes operate at lower airspeeds and over shorter
distances that do part 25 airplanes; therefore, their exposure to moisture and temperature conditions where icing
may occur is higher than it is for transport category airplanes. Because of this environmental exposure, the potential
for an inoperative heated pitot tube becoming a hazard to part 23 airplanes is greater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed requirement also responds to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation A&hyph;92&hyph;85,
which recommends requiring a modification to certain part 23 airplanes to provide for a pitot heat operating light
similar to the light required by &sect;25.1326 for transport category airplanes. NTSB issued the safety recommendation,
among others, as a result of a special investigation and analysis of a series of fatal accidents that occurred from
May 31, 1989, through March 17, 1991.

Section 23.1337(b) would also be revised by adding the word ``usable'' to the first sentence of this section. This
revision is consistent with the requirements of &sect;23.1337(b)(1), which requires the fuel quantity indicator
to be calibrated to read ``zero'' when the fuel in the tank is equal to the unusable fuel determined under &sect;23.959.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1337(b)(4) would require a ``means to indicate'' the amount of usable fuel in each tank when
the airplane is on the ground. This requirement would ensure that a reliable means is provided for the pilot to determine
before takeoff that the amount of fuel that is in the airplane is adequate for the intended flight. The ability to make
this preflight determination will help reduce the number of accidents that have resulted from fuel starvation. This
proposal, which is patterned after &sect;23.1337 (d) and (d)(1), would not require a separate fuel indicating system.
The means to determine the amount of fuel while on the ground may be provided by a calibrated dipstick, separate markings
on the inflight fuel indicator, or any other acceptable means selected by the manufacturer. Accordingly, this proposal
would contribute to the safe operation of the airplane and would not appreciably add to the cost of the airplane design.

Section 23.1351&blank;General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise current &sect;23.1351 by removing portions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) and by removing
all of paragraph (b)(4). The removed requirements are applicable to alternators that depend upon the battery for
initial excitation or for stabilization. This revision responds to a Joint Aviation Authority recommendation to
remove the provisions that allow a battery failure to result in the loss of the alternator. Information in this recommendation
showed that self-excited alternators are now available for installation on newly certificated airplanes. The FAA
has verified that self-excited alternators are now available; therefore, there is no longer a need for the regulations
to address alternators that depend upon a battery for initial excitation and stabilization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;23.1351(c)(3) would require an automatic means for reverse current protection. Reverse current
protection is accomplished by means that automatically detect changes in the current. The proposed revised wording
would more accurately define this function and the equipment that would accomplish the protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;23.1351(f) would be revised by adding a requirement that would require the ground power receptacle
to be located where its use will not result in a hazard to the airplane or to people on the ground using the receptacle.

Section 23.1353&blank;Storage Battery Design and Installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1353(h) would require that, in the event of a complete loss of the primary electrical power
generating system, airplane battery capacity must be sufficient to supply at least 30 minutes of electrical power
to those loads essential to the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal is not limited to airplanes that are approved for any particular type of operation. Although the battery
capacity needed for an airplane approved for day visual flight rules (VFR) operations would be much less than the capacity
for an airplane approved for day/night instrument flight rules (IFR) operations, the same level of safety should
be provided for all airplanes. While this proposal would add an additional requirement to part 23 for normal, utility,
acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes, in practice this requirement to provide a battery capacity sufficient
to supply at least 30 minutes of electrical power is not new to many airplane manufacturers. Certain other countries
in which part 23 airplanes have been certificated have requirements for such a 30-minute battery capacity. Manufacturers'
experience with these requirements has shown that the only design impact that results from complying with these requirements
is the need to install a battery with greater capacity than might otherwise be installed. Experience has also shown
that a load shedding procedure may be necessary for certain airplanes. No other airplane design changes would be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the above referenced experience record, this requirement would be new to some manufacturers and they may
have questions on how it would be applied. For that reason, this notice discusses compliance considerations that
have emerged from experience based on substantively equivalent requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This compliance experience has shown that the rating of the battery selected for the airplane should be sufficient
to cover the loss of capacity that would occur with battery age and the reduced capacity that results from a realistic
state of charge, which may be less than a full charge. Using a design battery capacity that is only 75 percent of the battery
nameplate rating would be an acceptable way of accounting for these losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to determining the battery rating that would be needed, the manufacturer would also need to determine
the functions that would be necessary for 30 minutes of safe flight and the landing of the airplane. Again, experience
has identified several functions. For a day VFR approved airplane, no functions may require battery power; however,
it may be necessary to supply power for certain communication capacities or, if the airplane has electrically powered
retractable landing gear, power may be required to lower the gear. Providing a secondary means for lowering the gear
would be an acceptable alternative to providing electrical power or battery power for this function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other types of operating approvals, providing power for the following functions and equipment should be considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Any required flight and navigation instruments. Air driven instruments that would function over the required
period can also be accepted for this function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cockpit and instrument lighting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For IFR and icing approvals, power for the heated pitot tube.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For radio communication, usually one VHF communication system with power for three to five minutes of transmission
would be acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Functions needed for safe night flight and night landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Electronic engine ignition systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Any functions that cannot be readily shed following the loss of generator power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Engine inlet heat or deicing protection required for normal operation of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although power for the listed functions may provide for the safe operation and landing of most airplanes, individual
airplane designs may require the consideration of additional functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying these rules it may be assumed that airframe and engine icing protection equipment would not be operating
at the time of the generator system failure. Power for icing protection would not be required if the icing protection
equipment is not required for the normal operation of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would require additional battery capacity and would not alter or supersede any other requirements
in this part for separate or dedicated emergency power supplies. When requirements such as those in current &sect;23.1331(a)
or in proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5) are applicable to the airplane design, these power supplies are required to provide
a needed level of safety for that function; therefore, that power source must be supplied.

Section 23.1359&blank;Electrical System Fire Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1359 would require smoke and fire protection for electrical system installations. The provisions
of &sect;23.1359(a) of this proposal state that electrical systems must meet the applicable requirements of &sect;&sect;23.863
and 23.1182.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1359(b) would require that the electrical systems components installed in designated fire zones
and used during emergency procedures be fire resistant. This provision is needed to clarify the requirements for
electrical system components that may be installed in the designated fire zones identified in &sect;23.1181.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;23.1359(c) provides burn criteria for electrical wire and cables. A proposed revision to appendix
F of part 23 that would add appropriate wire testing criteria is included in this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed burn criteria for wire is necessary because of the increased use of electrical systems in the design
of part 23 airplanes and the resulting increase in the amount of electrical wire being installed. This increased use
results in the need to ensure that wire insulating material does not become the source of an in-flight fire and/or that
it does not propagate a fire from another source. The electrical wire burn requirements in this proposal, along with
the testing identified in revised appendix F, would ensure that installed electrical wire has insulating material
that reduces the possibility of hazardous in-flight fires.

Section 23.1365&blank;Electrical Cables and Equipment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.1365(b) and would add three new paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.1365(b) would be revised in relation to proposed new &sect;23.1359(c), which would require self-extinguishing
insulated electrical wires and cables. Current &sect;23.1365(b) requires that cable and associated equipment
that would overheat in the event of circuit overload or fault must be flame resistant and may not emit dangerous quantities
of toxic fumes. The proposed revisions to &sect;23.1365(b) would remove the reference to electrical cables from
the flame resistance requirement since the cables would be required to have self-extinguishing insulation under
&sect;23.1359(c). The requirement for electrical cables and the associated equipment that would overheat to not
emit dangerous quantities of toxic fumes has been retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of &sect;23.1365(b) that includes the words ``at least flame resistant '' would also be revised by removing
the words ``at least''. The removed words implied that there were burn requirements, other than the ones in this section,
that must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three paragraphs that would be added by this proposal would require: (1) The identification of electrical cables,
terminals, and connectors; (2) the protection of electrical cables from damage by external sources; and (3) installation
criteria for cables that cannot be protected by a circuit protection device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As identified in the discussion of proposed &sect;23.1359, there is an increasing use of electrical systems in part
23 airplanes. The resulting increase in the number of electrical wires used in part 23 airplanes makes proper installation
difficult. The proposal for electrical cable identification would provide better assurance that the cables will
be correctly installed initially and correctly reinstalled when airplane maintenance or modifications are accomplished.
The other proposed new requirements would provide installation criteria that will ensure the protection of cables
under circumstances that can be expected from the increased use of electrical systems.

Section 23.1383&blank;Taxi and Landing Lights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The landing light requirements of &sect;23.1383 would be revised by adding taxi lights to this section. When the landing
light requirements were included in the normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category requirements, the same
lights were used for both night landing and taxiing of the airplane. Due to availability of different types of lights,
separate lights are now frequently installed for landing and for taxiing. Including the word ``taxi'' in the heading
would clarify that the requirements cover both kinds of lights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1383(a), which requires the lights to be acceptable, would be deleted because it is unnecessary
to state this. All lights that are found to meet the requirements of this section and other directly related airworthiness
requirements are acceptable. The paragraphs would be redesignated accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.1383(b)(3) requires that a landing light must be installed to provide enough light for a night landing.
Proposed &sect;23.1383(c) would revise ``night landing'' to ``night operation'' since the requirements would
also cover taxiing and parking. Proposed new paragraph (d) would require the lights to be installed so that they do
not cause a fire hazard. This clarifies the need for such an evaluation.

Section 23.1401&blank;Anticollision Light System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise &sect;23.1401 to require the installation of an anticollision light system on all part
23 airplanes. Current &sect;23.1401 requires an anticollision light system only if certification for night operations
is requested. When the requirements for anticollision lights were first added to the Civil Air Regulations (CAR),
part 3, in 1957, those requirements were needed to increase the conspicuity of the airplanes during night operations
because of the increasing air traffic density and the newer airplanes' capability to attain higher speeds. At the
time, the operating conditions did not show a need for such lights for daylight operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of airplanes that have been added to the fleet and the increasing speeds resulting from improved technology,
especially the increasing use of turbine engines, now necessitates the conspicuity provided by anticollision lights
for day operations as well. The FAA Accident and Incident data for the period 1984 through 1990 shows that 269 aircraft
were involved in midair collisions in which 108 fatalities occurred. A review of this data shows that 234 of these aircraft
were involved in accidents or incidents that occurred during VFR conditions and that 224 were involved in accidents
or incidents during day operations. The other 10 were involved in operations at night or dusk. The reports on 35 aircraft
did not identify the type of condition that existed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the types of aircraft identified by the reports in this data, 60 were balloons, gliders, or other aircraft that were
not certificated under part 23 and whose level of safety would not be changed by this proposal. When the data is revised
by removing those reports, it shows that 209 small, part 23 airplanes operated under VFR conditions were involved
in midair accidents or incidents and that at least 167 of these airplanes were being operated in day VFR conditions.
Because the occupant capacity of all the aircraft in the data ranged from one to ten, it can be assumed that the fatality
rate of .401 per aircraft (108 fatalities/269 aircraft) would be nearly the same for the 167 small airplanes operating
in day VFR conditions as it was for the 269 aircraft. Based on this assumption, there would have been approximately
67 fatalities that occurred in these 167 small airplane accidents and incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reports do not show if the airplanes involved were equipped with or were using anticollision lights. They do show
that a need exists to reduce the number of accidents. Requiring the installation of anticollision lights on all newly
certificated airplanes and, as proposed by revised &sect;91.209 in this notice, requiring operation of anticollision
lights during day operations would increase the airplane's conspicuity and contribute to a reduction in the number
of accidents. Even if such action is only 25 percent effective, a review of the 6-year service history indicates that
approximately 17 fatalities could be avoided in a similar 6-year period. Many manufacturers have realized the additional
safety that can be provided by the increased airplane conspicuity of using anticollision lights and have elected
to install an anticollision light system on all of the airplanes they produce. Therefore, most airplanes are now being
manufactured with an installed anticollision light system, and the FAA expects that this proposal would not result
in an economic burden on the aviation community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would add three new paragraphs to &sect;23.1431. Proposed new paragraph (c) would require that airplanes
required to be operated by more than one flightcrew member must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members
can converse without difficulty when they are seated at their duty stations. Accident investigations have shown
that, in some instances, conversation between the flightcrew members was severely hindered by the noise level in
the cockpit and that the inability to communicate contributed to the accident. If the required evaluation shows that
the noise level does not impair conversation, no further action is required. However, if the evaluation shows that
conversation will be difficult, an intercommunication system would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (d) would require that if installed communication equipment includes any means of switching
from receive to transmit, the equipment must use ``off-on'' transmitter switching that will ensure that the transmitter
is turned off when it is not being used. Transmitting equipment that remains in the transmit mode when not being used
blocks the frequency being used and can create an unsafe condition by preventing other needed communication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (e) would require that if provisions for the use of communications headsets are provided,
it must be demonstrated that flightcrew members can hear aural warnings when a headset is being used. Aural warnings
are required to warn the pilot of a condition that necessitates the pilot's taking action; therefore, it is necessary
to ensure that such warnings would be effective even when headsets are being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the proposed new requirements in paragraphs (c) and (e), the FAA considered proposing a
requirement that compliance demonstrations should be conducted under actual cockpit noise conditions when the
airplane is being operated. The FAA, however, ultimately determined that such a requirement could result in demonstrations
conducted under more severe noise conditions than needed. Accordingly, no such requirement is being proposed. If
the FAA determines in the future that noise conditions for demonstrations need to be specified, the FAA will define
these conditions in advisory material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1447(a)(4) would require that if radio equipment is installed in an airplane, flightcrew
oxygen dispensing units must be designed to allow the use of communication equipment when oxygen is being used. If
radio equipment is installed, that equipment cannot perform its intended function if the flightcrew is not provided
the proper means for its utilization under all operating conditions, including operations when oxygen is being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would not require all flightcrew oxygen dispensing units to be equipped with communication equipment.
Since an airplane may be operated in uncontrolled airspace, where two-way radio communication is not required and,
at the same time, be at altitudes where oxygen is required for the flightcrew members, some airplanes have a crew oxygen
system but no radio equipment. It would be inappropriate to require the flightcrew dispensing units of those airplanes
to be equipped with communication equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to &sect;23.1447(d) would require the flightcrew oxygen dispensing units to be automatically
presented before the cabin pressure altitude exceeds 15,000 feet or be the quick-donning type if the airplane is certificated
for operation above 25,000 feet. The requirement in paragraph (e) for the passenger dispensing units to be automatically
presented if the airplane is approved for operation above 30,000 feet has not been revised. The revision to paragraph
(d) would provide the flightcrew and the airplane passengers the same level of safety as provided by other airworthiness
standards. This proposed revision is also consistent with the proposed revision of &sect;23.841 in this notice.

This proposed new section would specify that fire protection is needed for oxygen equipment installations. Section

and require that oxygen system components be protected from the heat from designated fire zones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1451(c) would require oxygen equipment and lines to be separated from other equipment or to be
protected in a manner that would prevent escaping oxygen from striking grease, fluids, or vapors. The impingement
of pure oxygen on certain materials will lower their combustion point to a value where ignition will occur in ambient
conditions thereby creating a potential source for an airplane fire. In one instance, an airplane was destroyed by
fire that resulted when escaping oxygen impinged on lubricating material during maintenance of the airplane. The
proposed new section would ensure that oxygen systems are protected to prevent fire hazards that can result from escaping
oxygen.

Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that would justify its costs and is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not ``significant'' as defined in DOT's Policies and
Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute
a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.

This section summarizes the costs and benefits of each provision of the proposed rule. Many of the provisions would
impose either no cost or a negligible cost. Such provisions are typically administrative, editorial, clarifying,
relieving, or conforming in nature. In addition, the FAA holds that certain provisions have a potential safety benefit
that can be achieved with no incremental cost, due primarily to the fact that this rule would apply to future certificated

Evaluation of Provisions With Non-Negligible Projected Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes and evaluates those provisions of the proposed rule that are expected to impose costs that
are not negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23.697&blank;Wing Flap Controls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.697(c) would provide safety standards for the wing flap control lever designs installed in
airplanes that use wing flap settings other than fully retracted when showing compliance with &sect;23.145. The
FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could design the flap control lever to meet the proposed requirement in 8
hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $480 per certification. The control lever itself would impose an
incremental cost, including installation, of approximately $100 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nominal benefits of this provision would derive from the increased safety afforded the pilot in positively selecting
the proper flap setting to maintain longitudinal control. In fact, if a flap position other than fully retracted were
needed to maintain longitudinal control: (1) That position would be necessary to prevent an unsafe condition, (2)
the airplane would not be certificated under that design, and (3) the airplane would have to be redesigned so that intermediate
flap positions would not be needed for control. Proposed paragraph (c) would allow the identification of an intermediate
flap position and the positive means of selecting that position. This alternative would rectify the unsafe condition
without requiring the manufacturer to redesign the airplane.

Section 23.703&blank;Takeoff Warning System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would require a takeoff warning system on some commuter category airplanes. The requirement
would be applicable if the flight evaluation shows that an unsafe takeoff condition would result if lift devices or
longitudinal trim devices are set to any position outside the approved takeoff range. If the evaluation shows that
no unsafe condition would result at any setting of these devices, a takeoff warning system would not be required. For
those airplanes on which a warning system must be installed, the proposed rule would provide requirements for the
installation of the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that an evaluation to determine whether a takeoff warning system would be needed would cost $240
(4 hours of engineering at a burdened rate of $60 per hour). Where needed, the integration design of a warning system
would cost $2,400 (40 hours at $60 per hour). In addition, an incremental 4 hours of flight testing at a cost of $2,720
($500 per hour for two test pilots and $180 per hour for fuel) would be needed to demonstrate the system's performance.
The FAA estimates that the system, including acquisition, wiring, micro switches, and labor, would add approximately
$1,000 to the cost of each airplane required to have one. Maintenance of such a system would cost approximately $100
per year. The FAA solicits comments from interested parties concerning the expected certifications that would require
a takeoff warning system and the concomitant costs to acquire, install, and maintain them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nominal benefits of this proposal would derive from the increased safety provided by the takeoff warning system
that would activate whenever lift or longitudinal trim devices are not set within their approved takeoff ranges.
In fact, if an evaluation showed that positions of the lift or longitudinal trim devices could create an unsafe condition
on takeoff, the manufacturer would be required, under existing regulations, to redesign the devices so that the unsafe
positions could not be obtained. The proposed section would provide relief by allowing the applicant to install a
warning system rather than redesigning the trim device(s).

Section 23.735&blank;Brakes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.735(e), applicable to commuter category airplanes, would require establishing the minimum
rejected takeoff brake kinetic energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly. Section 23.45 provides
that the determination of the accelerate-stop distance for commuter category airplanes be made in accordance with
the applicant's procedures for operation in service. This proposed requirement is needed to ensure that the brakes
will perform safely under accelerate-stop conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, manufacturers of commuter airplanes could determine the kinetic energy absorption requirements
either through a conservative rational analysis of the sequence of events expected during a rejected takeoff or by
using a formula presented in proposed new &sect;23.735(e)(2). It is projected that the necessary determination
would cost $240 based on four hours of engineering at a burdened rate of $60 per hour. The potential benefits of the proposal
would derive from the added safety that would be provided by establishing beforehand the minimum necessary kinetic
energy capacity rating of each main wheel brake assembly under rejected-takeoff conditions.

Section 23.775&blank;Windshields and Windows
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Introductory text and paragraph (h)(1) would be added to require that commuter category windshield panes that are
directly in front of the pilots be able to withstand the impact of a two pound bird at maximum approach flap speed. By
requiring full protection against the strike of a two-pound bird at approach speed, additional protection would
also be provided if the airplane strikes a larger bird or strikes a bird at a higher speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.775(h)(2) would further require the panels of the windshield to be so arranged that, if one is damaged,
other panels would remain to provide visibility for continuous safe flight and landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs of proposed &sect;23.775(h) would vary depending on the circumstances of the affected manufacturer.
Industry sources estimate that the total nonrecurring cost per model would range from $250,000 to $350,000, consisting
of: (1) Up to $200,000 for a bird strike test article (``bird gun'') if the manufacturer does not have one; and (2) up
to $150,000 of time and materials costs for the actual testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer that has a bird strike test article would not incur additional capital test costs. Most manufacturers
would incur up to $150,000 in time and materials costs for the actual testing, but even these costs would be mitigated
by the existing need of most manufacturers to perform such tests for export sales to JAA member countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that there would be no identifiable increment in design or tooling costs since the windshield
would be an integral part of the initial design. Similarly, little or no recurring costs per airplane (incremental
materials, installation, or weight) are projected since it is reasonable to assume that the pressure load, as compared
to bird strike resistance, would be the controlling factor in the windshield design strength.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefit of the proposed rule is the incremental protection against bird strikes that would be afforded to commuter
category airplanes. The FAA has reviewed International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data on bird strikes
that occurred on member-country airplanes of 19,000 pounds or less than 1981 through 1989. These data show that approximately
550 strikes occurred and that one out of seven strikes hit the windshield. The data show that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Almost 52 percent of the strikes occurred at altitudes of less than 100 feet, and 26.7 percent occurred between 101
and 1000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Eighty-five percent of the strikes occurred at airspeeds of 150 knots or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Where bird types were reported, 27.6 percent of the strikes involved small birds and 58.6 involved medium size birds
(2 pounds or less).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Incidents where the airplane was damaged showed that 16.9 percent resulted from small bird strikes and 64 percent
resulted from medium size bird strikes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These data show that most bird strikes occur at takeoff and landing altitudes and airspeeds, and that birds weighing
two pounds or less are struck most often. The standards of the proposed provision are based on these statistics. Few
fatalities and injuries resulted from the bird strikes reported in the ICAO data. Similarly, a review of NTSB accident
records between 1982 and 1992 revealed no U.S. accidents resulting from bird strikes to the windshields of commuter
category airplanes. As a result, the FAA is not able to illustrate the justification of this provision on the basis
of historical accidents. Instead, the standards are being proposed based on the expert recommendations of the ARAC.
It is also noted that this standard will be applied in JAA member countries and that U.S. manufacturers wishing to export
to those countries would be required to meet the standard in any event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that this provision cannot be quantitatively supported on the basis of past accidents alone, the FAA expressly
requests public input and comments on its expected costs and potential benefits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new paragraph (f) would require that the locks on lavatory doors, if installed, be designed so that they would
not trap occupants. Lavatory door locks used in transport category airplanes (see &sect;25.783) meet the requirements
of this proposed rule. The FAA estimates that the incremental cost of this provision would be no more than $25 per lock.
The proposal would reduce the likelihood that occupants would be trapped in a locked lavatory, both in emergency and
non-emergency situations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would extend to normal, utility, and acrobatic airplanes the existing commuter requirement to
prevent baggage from hazardous shifting. The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer would be required for 1 hour,
at a burdened cost of $60 per hour, to analyze the subject loads that would need to be constrained. Tiedowns would cost
approximately $50 per baggage compartment, or no more than $100 per airplane. These additional costs would apply
only to normal, utility, or acrobatic airplanes since commuter category airplanes are already subject to the requirement
under the existing rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential benefits of the proposed provision include the reduced likelihood: (1) That baggage compartments
would be overloaded, (2) that stowed baggage would shift dangerously, and (3) that essential co-located equipment
or wiring would be damaged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would require at least one illuminated sign notifying all passengers when seat belts should
be fastened. The requirement would apply only to airplanes where flightcrew members could not observe occupant seats
or where the flightcrew compartment is separated from the passenger compartment. The signs would have to be legible
to all seated passengers and be operable from a crewmember station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could design the required sign(s) in 1 hour, at a burdened rate of $60 per
hour. The sign would cost approximately $200 per airplane, including parts and installation costs. Maintenance
costs for bulb replacement would be negligible. The weight penalty associated with the light system would also be
minor (no more than 2 pounds).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety benefits of the proposed change would derive from the increased likelihood that passengers would know
when their seat belts should be fastened.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.807(a)(4) would provide the same hazard protection for a person using an emergency exit as
that provided by proposed &sect;23.783(b) for a person who uses a passenger door. Emergency exits could not be located
with respect to a propeller disk or any other hazard in a manner that would endanger persons using that exit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA holds that no incremental cost would be incurred to meet the standards of the proposed provision for newly certificated
airplanes. However, this notice specifically requests that interested parties submit comments on the potential
costs and methods of compliance that manufacturers would choose to comply with this proposed requirement.

The proposed revision to &sect;23.807(b)(5) would editorially revise the current egress requirements for acrobatic
airplanes. New &sect;23.807(b)(6) would establish similar egress standards for utility category airplanes that
are certificated for spinning. Industry sources estimate that an aerobatic, quick-release door would cost an incremental
$10,000 in engineering design per affected airplane model and an additional $500 per production airplane. Little
or no additional weight is expected. These costs would apply only in cases where the manufacturer determines that
the marketplace return of a combination type certificate would outweigh the additional costs of design and production.

Section 23.841&blank;Pressurized Cabins
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision to &sect;23.841(a) would extend the cabin pressure requirements of current paragraph (a),
which now apply to airplanes certificated for operation above 31,000 feet, to airplanes certificated for operation
above 25,000 feet. Current part 25, JAR 25, and proposed JAR 23 include the same requirement proposed here. This proposed
requirement is intended to protect airplane occupants from harm if a malfunction occurs at altitudes where symptoms
of hypoxia occur, usually above 25,000 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For airplanes that will be certificated for maximum altitude operation between 25,000 feet and 31,000 feet, the proposal
would necessitate two additional pressure altitude regulators and associated plumbing. Industry sources estimate
that the proposed requirement would cost an incremental $1,000 in engineering design per affected airplane model
and $2,000 per production airplane. Any additional weight would be negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of the proposal would derive from the incremental protection against hypoxia afforded to occupants
of airplanes certificated for maximum altitude between 25,000 and 31,000 feet. Due to the increasing use of turbine
engines, more part 23 airplanes are likely to be approved for operation above 25,000 feet. In the absence of this proposed
rule, an increasing number of occupants would be exposed to the potential for harm in the event of a failure or malfunction
of the pressure system on these airplanes.

Section 23.855&blank;Cargo and Baggage Compartment Fire Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) would require all sources of heat within each cargo and baggage compartment that are capable
of igniting the compartment contents to be shielded and insulated to prevent such ignition. Existing &sect;23.787(f)
requires that cargo compartment lamps be installed so as to prevent contact between the lamp bulb and cargo. The proposal
would clarify and extend this provision to include all sources of heat for baggage as well as cargo compartments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lights and (rarely) heaters for pets are typically the only sources of heat located in a baggage or cargo compartment.
A wire cage, costing no more than $20, around the heat source would meet these requirements. The FAA estimates that
the cost of compliance per airplane would be no more than $40 in those rare cases where such protection would not have
been provided anyway. The benefit of the proposed provision is a reduction in the possibility of fire caused by the
ignition of compartment contents by lights or heaters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) would require cargo and baggage compartments to be constructed of materials that meet the
appropriate provisions of &sect;23.853(d)(3). Currently these requirements apply to commuter category airplanes
and to the materials used in the compartments of these airplanes. The proposed new requirement would expand this applicability
to the cargo and baggage compartments of all part 23 airplanes. In effect, the proposed new requirement would require
materials that are self-extinguishing rather than flame resistant as currently required under &sect;23.787(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information provided by manufacturers shows that materials that meet self-extinguishing flame requirements are
available at a slightly higher cost than materials that meet flame resistant requirements. The FAA conservatively
estimates that the incremental costs of complying with proposed &sect;23.855(b) would be less than $200 per airplane.
The safety benefits of this provision would be an increase in cargo and baggage compartment fire protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (c) would add new fire protection requirements for cargo and baggage compartments for commuter
category airplanes. The proposed rule would require one of the following three alternatives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The compartment just be located where pilots seated at their duty station would easily discover the fire or the
compartment must be equipped with a smoke or fire detector system to warn the pilot's station. The compartment must
also be accessible for fire extinguisher application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The compartment may be inaccessible, but must be equipped with a fire detector system that warns the pilot station,
and the compartment must have ceiling and sidewall floor panels constructed of materials that have been subjected
to and meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F to part 23. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The compartment must be constructed and sealed to contain any fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA cannot predict the designs of cargo and baggage compartment for future airplanes. If manufacturers choose
to use smoke detectors, however, no more than 2 smoke detectors would be required per airplane. An aerospace engineer
could determine the most appropriate location and design the smoke detector system in approximately 30 hours at a
burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $1,800 per certification. Two detectors, including wiring and installation,
are estimated to cost about $4,550. Maintenance costs for the smoke detectors would cost approximately $100 per year.
Materials that would meet the vertical self-extinguishing tests of appendix F (see option 2 in the discussion above)
would result in incremental costs of less than $200 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it would cost $500 to construct a sealed compartment, or a total of $1,000 for 2 compartments,
if the manufacturer chooses that method of complying with the proposed requirement (see option 3 in the discussion
above).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irrespective of the individual compliance method, the benefits of the proposed provision would come from the increased
likelihood that a cargo or baggage compartment fire would either be extinguished or contained.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revised &sect;23.1303(d) would add the requirement for a free air temperature indicator for those airplanes whose
performance must be based on weight, altitude, and temperature. This requirement already applies to turbine powered
airplanes. The proposal would extend the requirement to reciprocating engine powered airplanes of more than 6,000
pounds. Industry sources estimate that the proposed requirement would cost an incremental $500 in engineering design
per affected airplane model and $350 per production airplane. Any additional weight would be negligible. The potential
benefits of the proposal would accrue from the requirement that the information necessary to determine the performance
envelope of the airplane be available to the pilot.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1303(g) would identify specific instruments, and limits of those instruments, required for
commuter category airplanes. Proposed &sect;23.1303(g)(1) states that if airspeed limitations vary with altitude,
the airspeed indicators must show the variation of the maximum operating limit speed (V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) with altitude. Industry sources indicate that an airspeed indicator with V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``pointer'' would cost $1,000 more than one without. Two airspeed indicators are required on commuter airplanes,
therefore, the incremental cost of this requirement would be $2,000 per commuter category airplane produced. The
potential safety benefit of the proposal would derive from the requirement that the information necessary to determine
the maximum operating limit speed be available at all altitudes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1303(g)(3) would require (for commuter category IFR-approved airplanes with passenger seating
configurations of 10 more) a third, independent, attitude indicator (AI). Industry sources estimate that an aerospace
engineer could design and document a third attitude instrument system in 100 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour,
totalling $6,000 per certification. It is estimated that an AI would cost approximately $8,000, including a standby
battery, and that the installation would cost $2,200 for 40 hours of a mechanic's time at a burdened rate of $55 per hour.
However, proposed &sect;23.1311(a)(5), discussed below, would delete the requirement for a rate-of-turn indicator
when an independent attitude indicator is installed. The costs associated with a rate-of-turn indicator include:
40 hours of design and documentation costs, $1,000 per indicator, and 40 hours of installation. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
incremental 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cost for an IFR-approved airplane with a passenger seating capacity of 10 or more would be $3,600 for 60 hours of engineering
(100 hours for the AI, minus 40 hours for the rate-of-turn indicator); $7,000 for the instrument ($8,000 for the AI,
minus $1,000 for the rate-of-turn indicator); and no additional cost for the installation (40 hours for the AI, minus
40 hours for the rate-of-turn indicator). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential safety benefits of a third, independent attitude indicator would derive from the reduced potential
for erroneous attitude information. Currently, two attitude instruments are required for a ten passenger, IFR approved
commuter category airplane. Service experience has shown that a failure can occur whereby an attitude indicator
can appear to be working when it is actually providing incorrect information. During such a failure, pilots may have
difficulty determining which instrument to follow, and hazardous flight attitudes may result. A third attitude
indicator would allow the crew to retain reliable attitude information even in cases where one instrument is not operating
correctly.

Section 23. 1326&blank;Pitot Heat Indication System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new G23.1326 would require the installation of a pitot tube heat indicating system on those airplanes required
to be equipped with a heated pitot tube. Heated pitot tubes ensure that moisture will not freeze in the tube and block
or partially block the airspeed system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pitot heat indicating system, including an in-line current sensor, panel light, and associated wiring, would cost
approximately $500. According to industry sources, an aerospace engineer could design and document such a system
in 20 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, totalling $1,200. A mechanic could install the system in 20 hours at a burden
rate of $55 per hour, totalling $1,100. The estimated non-recurring cost per certification, therefore, would total
$2,800 ($1,200 for design, $500 for the certification airplane's indicator, and $1,100 for installation of that
indicator). The estimated cost per production airplane would be $1,600 ($500 for the system and $1,100 for installation).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated a series of single model accidents that occurred between
May 1989 and March 1991. During that period, five fatal accidents and a near fatal incident occurred in the United States.
Two additional fatal accidents involving the same airplane model occurred in foreign countries. The NTSB's analysis
indicated that four of the five U.S. accidents probably involved ice blockage of the pitot tubes because the pilots
failed to activate pitot heat before flying into freezing instrument meteorological conditions. The Board recommended
(A&hyph;92&hyph;86) that the FAA consider requiring a pitot heat operating light on small airplanes certificated
to operate in icing conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pitot heat indicating system would advise the pilots of any inoperative heating element in the pitot tube and that
subsequent inaccuracies could result. The proposed provision would reduce the likelihood that pilots would rely
on inaccurate airspeed information resulting from a blocked or partially blocked pitot tube.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.1353(h) would require that, in the event of a complete loss of the primary electrical power
generating system, airplane battery capacity must be sufficient to supply at least 30 minutes of electrical power
to those loads essential to the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, manufacturers may need to install larger batteries with greater capacities to comply with the proposed
requirements. The FAA estimates that the size and capacity of a larger battery would add no more than a few pounds (incremental
operating costs of less than $10 per year) and $20 to $30 of additional cost for the battery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On some airplanes, a ``load shedding'' procedure, where the pilot would sequentially turn off certain equipment,
could be required either in place of or in addition to a larger battery. The procedure would be provided in the pilot's
operating handbook (POH). The FAA estimates that an aerospace engineer could establish a load shedding procedure
in 10 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $600 per affected certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irrespective of the method of compliance, the proposal would increase the likelihood that sufficient electrical
power would be available to safely land the airplane in the event of an electrical generating system failure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;23.1359(c) would provide burn criteria for electrical wire and cables. A proposed revision to appendix
F to part 23 would add appropriate wire testing criteria. Demonstrating and documenting that electrical wires and
cables meet the requirements of this provision would take an aerospace engineer approximately 4 hours at a burdened
rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $240 per certification. The requirement and testing criteria would increase the
likelihood that necessary wires and cables would continue to function in the event of a fire.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;23.1365(d) would add a requirement for the identification of electrical cables, terminals, and
connectors. Different colored wires and/or tags could be used in conjunction with a wiring diagram to identify the
cables, terminals, and connectors. The FAA estimates that a draftsman could design and document this identification
system in 80 hours at a burdened rate of $55 per hour, a total of $4,400 per certification. Incremental installation
costs would be approximately $100 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increasing use of electrical systems in part 23 airplanes has added to the difficultly of wiring installation.
The proposed requirement for cable identification would increase the likelihood that cables would be correctly
installed initially and would be correctly reinstalled as part of later maintenance or modification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise &sect;23.1401 to require the installation of an anticollision light system on all part
23 airplanes. Current &sect;23.1401 requires an anticollision light system only if certification for night operations
is requested. Many manufacturers currently install anticollision light systems on all airplanes they produce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that an aerospace engineer could design and document an anticollision light system in
40 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $2,400 per affected certification. The system would cost $500
and would take a mechanic approximately 20 hours to install at a burdened rate of $55 per hour, a total of $1,600 per affected
airplane ($500 + (20 hours &times; $55 per hour) = $1,600). The weight penalty would be negligible. Only those future
models that would not otherwise have anticollision light systems would actually incur incremental costs as a result
of this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of airplanes that have been added to the small airplane fleet and the increasing speeds resulting from improved
technology, especially turbine engines, warrant the use of anticollision lights for day operations as well as night.
The FAA Accident and Incident data for the period 1984 through 1990 show that 269 aircraft were involved in midair collisions
in which 108 fatalities occurred. When the data were filtered (to account for night operations, IFR conditions, and
aircraft not affected by this proposal), it shows that at least 167 airplanes were involved in accidents or incidents
that occurred in day VFR conditions. The reports do not reveal whether the airplanes were using anticollision lights
at the time of the accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA holds that requiring the installation of anticollision lights on all newly certificated airplanes, and requiring
their operation during day operations (as proposed by revised &sect;91.209 and discussed later in this evaluation),
would reduce the number of daylight, midair accidents. Even if the proposed requirement were only 25 percent effective,
the 6-year accident history indicates that approximately 17 fatalities could be avoided during a similar 6-year
period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would add three new paragraphs to &sect;23.1431. Proposed new paragraph (c) would require that airplanes
required to be operated by more than one flightcrew member must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members
can converse without difficulty when they are seated at their duty stations. If the required evaluation shows that
the noise level does not impair conversation, no further action would be required. If the evaluation shows that conversation
would be difficult, however, an intercommunication system would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that an evaluation of cockpit noise could be conducted in conjunction with other certification
testing, therefore, no incremental costs are associated with the evaluation. An aerospace engineer could design
an intercom system in 20 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $1,200 per affected certification. The
FAA estimates that the addition of an intercom system would cost approximately $500 per airplane. A mechanic could
install the system in approximately 20 hours at a burdened rate or $55 per hour. The total incremental production cost
for an affected airplane, therefore, would be $1,600 ($500 + 20 hours &times; $55 per hour)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (d) would require that if the communication equipment that is installed includes any means
of switching from the receive mode to the transmit mode, the equipment must use ``off-on'' transmitter switching
that turns the transmitter off when it is not being used. The cost of this feature is included in the $500 cost of the intercom,
described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB investigation of at least two commuter accidents determined that excessive cockpit noise levels probably adversely
affected the ability of the flight crews to communicate (Bar Harbor Airlines, Flight 1808, August 25, 1985, 8 fatalities;
and Henson Airlines, Flight 1517, September 23, 1985, 14 fatalities.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Board recommended (A&hyph;86&hyph;113) that the FAA require the installation and use of crew interphone
systems in the cockpit of airplanes operating under part 135. The benefit of the proposed requirement would derive
from the increased likelihood that flightcrew members would be able to converse without difficulty and that the safety
hazard of miscommunication would be reduced.

Proposed new &sect;23.1447(a)(4) would require that if radio equipment is installed in an airplane, flightcrew
oxygen dispensing units must be designed to allow use of the communication equipment when oxygen is being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that an oxygen mask with an integral microphone costs $1,000 more than an oxygen mask without
a microphone. The costs per affected airplane, therefore, would be $2,000 for two masks. The benefit of the proposed
requirement is that it would allow flightcrew communication under all operating conditions, including operations
when oxygen is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed new section would clarify the rupture protection needed for oxygen system installation. Rupture protection
for oxygen systems is currently required by the application of the structures load requirements of part 23. The addition
of &sect;23.1453(a) would clarify the application of these load requirements and would identify the need to consider
maximum temperatures and pressures that may be present. Section 23.1453(b) would identify the protection to be provided
for high pressure oxygen sources and the high pressure lines that connect these sources to the oxygen system shutoff
valves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry sources estimate that an aerospace engineer could analyze and document the loads on each element of the oxygen
system in 16 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $960. The routing of oxygen pressure sources
and lines to protect them from unsafe temperatures and crash landings would be part of an airplane's basic design and
would not impose incremental costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;91.209(b) would require airplanes equipped with an anticollision light system to operate those
lights during all operations, including daytime VFR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incremental cost of this provision would be incurred for light bulb replacement. The FAA estimates that a light
bulb for an anticollision light system costs approximately $50 and that this provision would necessitate an incremental
bulb replacement every two years. Accordingly, the cost is projected to equal $25 per year, per affected operating
airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Regulator Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
if a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number
of small entities. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes threshold cost
values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. The
proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The proposed rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to revise the airworthiness standards to provide systems and equipment standards for normal, utility,
acrobatic, and commuter airplanes that are the same as the standards that will be proposed for the same category airplanes
by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe. If adopted, the proposed revision would reduce the regulatory burden
on the United States and European airplane manufacturers by relieving them on the need to show compliance with different
standards each time they seek certification approval of an airplane in a different country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation, the FAA has determined
that this proposed regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation
of the proposal has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

must be selected for the activation of the downward pitching control that provides a safe margin above any airspeed
at which any unsatisfactory stall characteristics occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition to the stall warning required by &sect;23.207, a warning that is clearly distinguishable to the pilot
under all expected flight conditions without requiring the pilot's attention, must be provided for faults that would
prevent the system from providing the required pitching motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each system must be designed so that the artificial stall barrier can be quickly and positively disengaged by the
pilots to prevent unwanted downward pitching of the airplane by a quick release (emergency) control that meets the
requirements of &sect;23.1329(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The pitch servo for that system may be used to provide the stall downward pitching motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In showing compliance with &sect;23.1309, the system must be evaluated to determine the effect that any announced
or unannounced failure may have on the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane or the ability of the crew to
cope with any adverse conditions that may result from such failures. This evaluation must consider the hazards that
would result from the airplane's flight characteristics if the system was not provided, and the hazard that may result
from unwanted downward pitching motion, which could result from failures at airspeeds above the selected stall speed.

Specimen configuration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided for materials used in electrical wire and cable insulation and in small parts, materials must be
tested either as a section cut from a fabricated part as installed in the airplane or as a specimen simulating a cut section,
such as: a specimen cut from a flat sheet of the material or a model of the fabricated part. The specimen may be cut from
any location in a fabricated part; however, fabricated units, such as sandwich panels, may not be separated for a test.
The specimen thickness must be no thicker than the minimum thickness to be qualified for use in the airplane, except
that: (1) Thick foam parts, such as seat cushions, must be tested in 1/2-inch thickness; (2) when showing compliance
with &sect;23.853(d)(3)(v) for materials used in small parts that must be tested, the materials must be tested in
no more than 1/8-inch thickness; (3) when showing compliance with &sect;23.1359(c) for materials used in electrical
wire and cable insulation, the wire and cable specimens must be the same size as used in the airplane. In the case of fabrics,
both the warp and fill direction of the weave must be tested to determine the most critical flammability conditions.
When performing the tests prescribed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this appendix, the specimen must be mounted in a metal
frame so that (1) in the vertical tests of paragraph (d) of this appendix, the two long edges and the upper edge are held
securely; (2) in the horizontal test of paragraph (e) of this appendix, the two long edges and the edge away from the
flame are held securely; (3) the exposed area of the specimen is at least 2 inches wide and 12 inches long, unless the
actual size used in the airplane is smaller; and (4) the edge to which the burner flame is applied must not consist of
the finished or protected edge of the specimen but must be representative of the actual cross section of the material
or part installed in the airplane. When performing the test prescribed in paragraph (f) of this appendix, the specimen
must be mounted in a metal frame so that all four edges are held securely and the exposed area of the specimen is at least
8 inches by 8 inches.

Forty-five degree test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A minimum of three specimens must be tested and the results averaged. The specimens must be supported at an angle of
45 degrees to a horizontal surface. The exposed surface when installed in the aircraft must be face down for the test.
The specimens must be exposed to a Bunsen or Tirrill burner with a nominal 3/8-inch I.D. tube adjusted to give a flame
of 11/2 inches in height. The minimum flame temperature measured by a calibrated thermocouple pyrometer in the center
of the flame must be 1550 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. Suitable precautions must be taken to avoid drafts. The flame must be applied for 30 seconds with one-third
contacting the material at the center of the specimen and then removed. Flame time, glow time, and whether the flame
penetrates (passes through) the specimen must be recorded.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sixty-degree test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A minimum of three specimens of each wire specification (make and size) must be tested. The specimen of wire or cable
(including insulation) must be placed at an angle of 60 degrees with the horizontal in the cabinet specified in paragraph
(c) of this appendix, with the cabinet door open during the test or placed within a chamber approximately 2 feet high
x 1 foot x 1 foot, open at the top and at one vertical side (front), that allows sufficient flow of air for complete combustion
but is free from drafts. The specimen must be parallel to and approximately 6 inches from the front of the chamber. The
lower end of the specimen must be held rigidly clamped. The upper end of the specimen must pass over a pulley or rod and
must have an appropriate weight attached to it so that the specimen is held tautly throughout the flammability test.
The test specimen span between lower clamp and upper pulley or rod must be 24 inches and must be marked 8 inches from the
lower end to indicate the central point for flame application. A flame from a Bunsen or Tirrill burner must be applied
for 30 seconds at the test mark. The burner must be mounted underneath the test mark on the specimen, perpendicular
to the specimen and at an angle of 30 degrees to the vertical plane of the specimen. The burner must have a nominal bore
of three-eighths inch, and must be adjusted to provide a three-inch-high flame with an inner cone approximately one-third
of the flame height. The minimum temperature of the hottest portion of the flame, as measured with a calibrated thermocouple
pyrometer, may not be less than 1,750 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The burner must be positioned so that the hottest portion of the flame is applied to the test mark on the wire.
Flame time, burn length, and flaming time of drippings, if any, must be recorded. The burn length determined in accordance
with paragraph (h) of this appendix must be measured to the nearest one-tenth inch. Breaking of the wire specimen is
not considered a failure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Forest Service (FS) is proposing to establish a new system of records in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974
(5 U.S.C. 552a). This system of records, entitled Electronic Corpsmember Information System (ELCID), USDA/FS&hyph;51,
is necessary to monitor individual Job Corps Enrollees' educational progress as well as to provide cumulative results
of training programs at each individual Forest Service Job Corps Center. The data could be used to counsel enrollees
as well as to adjust a Center's training program to more effectively meet enrollee needs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, USDA is proposing to create a new system of records to be maintained by FS.
The purpose of the system of records, entitled ELCID, would be to track administrative information on Job Corps students
so that training for the students may be presented in a most efficient and effective manner. The information compiled
on Job Corps students would include: Name, social security number, address, phone number, date of birth, date of entry,
race, legal guardian, recruiter, test scores from the Test of Adult Basic Education, educational progress, vocational
progress, Job Corps Center progress, behavioral reports, leave record, dormitory assignment, and pay status. The
Forest Service Job Corps Center frequently require such data to be updated and reviewed to train Job Corps students
more effectively. Some of this information (name, address, social security number, date of birth, date of entry,
test scores, educational progress, vocational progress, overall program progress, and pay status) also would be
shared with the Department of Labor's Student Pay Allowance and Management Information System (SPAMIS) date base,
which is located in San Marcos, Texas, at Gary Job Corps Center. SPAMIS is the system that provides the students with
their monthly living allowance. The information that ELCID will compile is currently recorded in the administrative
record of each enrollee. Currently, these records must be reviewed manually for the purpose of discerning trends
in educational progress of enrollees or in the effectiveness of a particular training course. Data would originate
and be maintained at each individual Center.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that 17 environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests.

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement
List.

 The New York Futures Exchange (NYFE) has submitted proposed rule amendments to its NYSE Composite Index (Index) futures
contract to base the final settlement price on the closing level of the Index on the third Friday of the contract month,
rather than on the special opening quotation on the third Friday, and change the last day of trading in the Index futures
and futures option contracts to the third Friday of the contract month from the day preceding the third Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In April 1987, the Commission approved rule amendments to the NYFE's NYSE Composite Index futures contract providing
that the final settlement price of the futures contract would be based on the special opening quotation of the Index,
rather than on the closing level of the Index, on the third Friday of the contract month. These amendments first went
into effect for the June 1987 contract month.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the implementation plan, during the transition period from June 1987 through March 1988 the NYFE listed concurrently
in each contract month two NYSE Composite Index futures contracts. The final settlement price for one contract was
based on the closing level of the Index while the final settlement price for the other contract was based on the special
opening quotation of the Index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effect of the proposed amendments would be that the final settlement price determination and last trading day
provisions would be identical to the previous rules of the subject contracts, as noted above. Current rules would
continue to apply to contracts expiring prior to June

1995.

The NYFE informed its members of the proposed amendments prior to listing the June 1995 contract month.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its submission, the NYFE noted that the use of the special opening quotation as a basis of cash settlement has caused
confusion among public customers. The level of the Index is disseminated based on the last transaction price of each
of the over 2,400 component stocks. However, the special opening quotation is calculated based on the opening price
of each component stock. Such opening stock prices typically are not determined contemporaneously. Thus, the level
of the special opening quotation may vary from the range of the cash Index level on the expiration Friday. The NYFE noted
such variations have resulted in numerous complaints from public customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that the final settlement prices for certain other broad-based stock index futures contracts
also are based on the closing levels of the relevant indices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Further, the final settlement prices for certain broad-based stock index option contracts traded on national securities
exchanges also are based on the closing levels of the relevant indices.

For example, the final settlement prices of the Value Line Average Stock Index futures contract of the Kansas City
Board of Trade and the Major Market Index futures contract of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are based on the closing
level of those indices.

In support of its proposed change, the NYFE noted its belief that the proposed amendments would have no detrimental
impact on the underlying market. According to NYFE staff, there is not significant futures trading volume associated
with direct arbitrage between the subject futures contract and the equities comprising the Index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is requesting comment on the proposed amendments, considering the appropriateness of the revised
procedures relative to the requirements of Commission Guideline No. 1. for cash settled futures contracts. Also,
the Commission requests comment as to whether there are any issues, in addition to the relative extent of cash/futures
arbitrage in this Index, that should be considered by the Commission in its review of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the proposed rule amendments can be obtained
through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254&hyph;6314. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In July 1993, in response to a tasking by Major General Raymund E. O'Mara, U.S. Air Force, the Director, DEFENSE MAPPING
AGENCY (DMA), 8613 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031&hyph;2137, and following the disruption to DMA's operations in
the St. Louis, MO area as a result of the floods, a Study Team was established to consider the future of DMA's printing
and distribution operations. On 4 January 1994, the Study Team reported to the Director, DMA, and made certain recommendations
calling for the streamlining of those operations to the end of improving customer service, making better use of resources,
and realizing recurring cost savings. Among other things, the Study Team recommended that a plan to consolidate the
management of the DMA printing and distribution operations and a detailed action plan for the collocation of DMA's
printing and distribution operations in a new facility to be built in the St. Louis, MO area by 1998 be developed. In
an announcement made 7 January 1994, the Director approved the Study Team's recommendations, including the recommendations
to develop a plan to consolidate the DMA printing and distribution operations and to develop an action plan for the
collocation of those operations in St. Louis, MO. As part of that action plan, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas
City District, acting on behalf of the DMA, contracted for an Environmental Assessment of the DMA proposal to consolidate
and collocate printing and distribution. The Environmental Assessment was prepared to evaluate the relocation
of a new site in the St. Louis metropolitan area of certain elements of the DMA Aerospace Center's printing operations
conducted at 8900 South Broadway, St. Louis, MO prior to the flooding and the consolidation to this proposed new St.
Louis location of current DMA printing and distribution activities located at Philadelphia, PA, Bethesda, MD, and
Riverdale, MD.

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Council
on Environmental Quality Guidelines (40 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 1500) and Department of Defense
Regulation ``Environmental Effects in the United States of DoD Actions'' (32 C.F.R. Part 188) that an Environmental
Impact Statement is not being prepared for the proposed consolidation of the DMA printing and distribution operations
and their collocation in the St. Louis, MO area at the Richardson Road site located near I&hyph;55 in northeast Jefferson
County, MO. The Environmental Assessment of this proposed action indicates that the proposed action will not create
any significant adverse impact on the physical environment and that no significant controversy related to the natural
environment is associated therewith. As a result of these findings, the Chief, Safety and Health Division, Human
Resources Directorate, DMA, has determined that the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required
in this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that approximately 250 positions Agency-wide will be reduced as a result of this proposed action.
Retraining, relocation and retirement incentives will be used to minimize the impact of this consolidation; however,
pending a final agency decision, the specifics of any such incentives have yet to be developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) has identified and resolved a potential conflict of interest
situation related to its contractor, Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis. This Notice satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 1706.8(e)
with respect to publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the Board's Organizational and Consultant Conflict of Interests Regulations, 10 CFR Part 1706 (OCI Regulations),
an organizational or consultant conflict of interest (OCI) means that because of other past, present, or future planned
activities or relationships, a contractor or consultant is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance
or advice to the Board, or the objectivity of such offeror or contractor in performing work for the Board is or might
be otherwise impaired, or such offeror or contractor has or would have an unfair competitive advantage. While the
OCI Regulations provide that contracts shall generally not be awarded to an organization where the Board has determined
that an actual or potential OCI exists and cannot be avoided, the Board may waive this requirement in certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's mission is to provide advice and recommendations to the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding public health
and safety matters related to DOE's defense nuclear facilities. This includes the review and evaluation of the content
and implementation of health and safety standards including DOE orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating
to the design, construction, operation and decommissioning of DOE defense nuclear facilities. In late 1991, Congress
amended the Board's enabling Act, broadening the Board's jurisdiction over defense nuclear facilities to include
the assembly, disassembly, and the testing of nuclear weapons. With this increase in responsibility, the Board revised
its priorities to include reviews of additional facilities, including, principally the Pantex Plant (Pantex),
Nevada Test Site (NTS), and additional facilities at Oak Ridge Y&hyph;12 Plant. The Board also recognized the need
to direct its attention to the activities of the weapons design laboratories such as Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Sandia National Laboratory (Sandia).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two matters of immediate concern to the Board are the safety of ongoing weapons disassembly operations and maintenance
of the capability to safely conduct nuclear testing operations. While the DOE had been engaged in these activities
for decades, significant changes in the national security posture resulted in shifts in emphasis within DOE. Unprecedented
numbers of simultaneous nuclear weapon retirements strained DOE's capabilities to develop and implement safe and
well-engineered procedures. A Congressionally-mandated and Presidentially-extended nuclear testing moratorium
removed the primary mechanism (i.e., an active, ongoing testing program) by which the capability to execute tests
safely was exercised and ensured. At the same time, the weapons programs at the nuclear weapons laboratories were
losing skilled and experienced personnel due to retirement, downsizing, and reassignments. This combination of
issues required the Board to increase its attention, and with it the number of associated reviews, at both Pantex and
the NTS. Further, the Board recognized that it needed individuals with expertise in multiple technical disciplines,
not previously required, to effectively meet the challenges and responsibilities of its new authority. These technical
disciplines included conventional and nuclear explosive technology and safety, nuclear materials handling and
storage, criticality safety, and nuclear weapons assembly, disassembly, storage and testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Board initiated an employee recruitment effort for individuals with formal training and experience in
weapons related disciplines, it also recognized a need for technical assistance from outside experts who have direct
relevant experience in this area. The Board identified Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis as an individual with the requisite
knowledge and experience needed to provide the Board with immediate assistance in the weapons area and entered into
an agreement with him for support services. Under this arrangement, Mr. Armenis provides technical expertise with
respect to the design of nuclear weapons currently being returned to Pantex for dismantlement, including historical
insight related to specific design and test details of the weapons systems. In particular, his expertise related
to the mechanical aspects of weapons physics packages is being utilized to ensure the safe disassembly, handling,
and storage of these nuclear weapons systems. Through the Board's direction, he has participated in reviews of various
weapon dismantlement procedures, observed the complete dismantlement of selected weapons, and provided valuable
insight into DOE developed operating and inspection standards for these activities. The Board believes that its
activities, supported by Mr. Armenis, have contributed to the following achievements at Pantex; institution of
a practice whereby the responsible DOE laboratories (LANL, LLNL, Sandia) review procedures for disassembly of nuclear
weapons for identification of potential safety questions; and improved conduct of operations in disassembly of
nuclear weapons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has subsequently learned that Mr. Armenis is providing consulting services to LANL that may create a potential
conflict of interest with his work for the Board. Specifically, Mr. Armenis assists the LANL staff in compiling complete
development reports for weapons that are presently in the stockpile and in preparing final documentation for NTS
tests that have been executed since none of the weapons have been thoroughly documented and final NTS device data has
not been compiled. His efforts involve working with LANL engineers in the proper compilation of data to assure consistency
in methods and to prevent the exclusion of critical details of this historical reconstruction of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board reviewed this situation and concluded that, even if the circumstances could give rise to a potential conflict
of interest situation, it is nonetheless in the best interest of the Government to have Mr. Armenis continue to provide
support to the Board for the reasons described below. Mr. Armenis possesses a comprehensive understanding of nuclear
weapons assembly and dismantlement procedures based on his approximately forty years of direct involvement in these
activities. He spent thirty years working at LANL as a design engineer and supervisor involved in the design and assembly
of nuclear devices from 1948 through 1977. He also assisted in the technical management and administration of a LANL
unit which was responsible for nuclear design, nuclear device assembly, production specifications liaison with
DOE contractors, and feasibility studies for various weapon programs. Further, since his departure from LANL, Mr.
Armenis has worked as a consultant for his former employer in this technical area. His efforts included reviews of
NTS test device records to determine document retention issues and the research of weapon development records. This
research has resulted in written histories of the development of various stockpile weapons. Therefore, Mr. Armenis's
unparalleled blend of hands-on expertise in the development of assembly and disassembly procedures of nuclear weapons,
coupled with his more recent work in research and recreation of these activities, makes him uniquely qualified to
assist the Board in its health and safety reviews of current DOE weapons disassembly efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also examined Mr. Armenis's current financial relationship with LANL, which includes a vested pension
program and approximately twelve weeks a year of the consulting work described above, and considered the potential
effect it may have on his objectivity in performing the Board's work. Based on this review, the Board determined that
these relationships should not interfere with his work for the Board since the pension, and any future increases,
is calculated according to fixed formulas and prior contributions, and the relative value of his LANL consulting
effort is low compared to the number of hours actually worked by Mr. Armenis each year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the continued use of Mr. Armenis by the Board is consistent with the spirit and intent of Board Recommendation
93&hyph;6 to the Secretary of Energy dated December 10, 1993. This recommendation highlights the need for DOE to retain
access to capability and capture the unique knowledge of individuals who have been engaged for many years in certain
critical defense nuclear activities in order to avoid future safety problems in these and related areas. The Board's
concern is that while documentation essential to DOE's current weapons dismantlement program exists on the design
and safety aspects of nuclear weapons, it is also important, for safety reasons, to involve individuals from the design
laboratories of LANL, LLNL, and Sandia. These individuals should participate in reviews of detailed dismantlement
procedures and specialized procedures and should respond to problems encountered in the course of weapon dismantlement.
The design individuals from the laboratories most needed in connection with dismantlement of a specific weapon are
those who had been active in the original design of that weapon.These individuals are believed to possess information
not recorded in documentation, such as reasons for specific design features and personal knowledge of any problems
that have arisen during design, fabrication, and stockpile life. Therefore, while the Board believes that DOE must
retain and utilize certain expertise in the weapons area, it also recognizes the value of acquiring specialized technical
support from Mr. Armenis in the fulfillment of its health and safety responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also recognized that it is unlikely that the work being performed by Mr. Armenis could be satisfactorily
performed by anyone else whose experience and affiliations would not give rise to a conflict of interest question.
That is because the individuals who have the requisite expertise in this area could only have obtained such expertise
through previous or current employment or consulting relationship with one or more of the weapons design laboratories.
The pertinent experience of other qualified individuals would therefore likely raise similar conflicting questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as the Board is required under its OCI Regulations, where reasonably possible, to initiate measures which
attempt to mitigate an OCI, Mr. Armenis and the Board agreed to the following during contract performance. Should
the effort Mr. Armenis is currently performing for LANL change from only providing assistance in the historical recreation
of past weapons activities to one of assessing the adequacy or safety of current weapons disassembly procedures or
some other task which would directly conflict with work he performs for the Board, he will immediately notify the Board,
which then will take further action as appropriate. Also, the efforts of Mr. Armenis will be overseen by experienced
technical staff of the Board who are able to ensure that all of his resultant work products are impartial and contain
full support for any findings and recommendations issued thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on the basis of the determination described above and pursuant to the applicable provisions of 10 CFR
part 1706, the Chairman of the Board granted a waiver of any conflicts of interests (and the pertinent provisions of
the OCI Regulations) with the Board's contract with Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis that might arise out of his existing relationship
with LANL.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
David Terry, complainant, is a blind vendor licensed by the respondent, the Tennessee Department of Human Services
(TDHS). Mr. Terry signed an agreement with TDHS to operate vending facility 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
249 located in the Safety Building in Knoxville, Tennessee. He began operation in July 1986. TDHS was given the right
to establish and maintain a food concession at the Public Safety Building by entering into an agreement with the City
of Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 21, 1972.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Licensing Agency (SLA), through its Department of Rehabilitation, operates the Tennessee Vending Facility
Program for blind vendors. The purpose of the program is to establish and support blind vendors operating vending
facilities on State, local, and Federal property. As the agency designated in Tennessee to carry out and manage the
vending facility program established by the Act, the SLA duly promulgated rules and regulations to govern the State
vending facility program. These rules and regulations are comprehensive in scope. Based on the State's Randolph-Sheppard
rules and regulations governing its program, Mr. Terry was required to make monthly income reports, paying a set-aside
fee based upon those monthly reports, and to maintain personal liability and product liability insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Terry, as noted previously, began his operation in July 1986. The major part of his sales came from persons employed
in the building and from trustees and inmates of the City Jail located on the second floor. In December 1986, only five
months after Mr. Terry started his operation, the City of Knoxville transferred operation of the City Jail to the Knox
County Sheriff's Department. The Sheriff's Department established on the second floor its own food commissary operated
by a sighted person and placed a cigarette machine on that floor as well. In January 1987, Mr. Terry complained to his
business enterprise counselor regarding the new commissary and vending machine possibly violating the priority
provided by the State rules and regulations to licensed blind persons. As a result of Mr. Terry's complaint, the cigarette
machine was removed in February 1987. However, the commissary remained. Mr. Terry then complained to the Committee
of Blind Vendors, the State representative body for all blind vendors. In July, the Sheriff agreed to allow Mr. Terry
to operate a concession booth in the Jail Intake Center, but, within a week, the Sheriff reversed this decision due
to alleged safety and security reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the operation of his vending facility, Mr. Terry was warned about his poor performance in failing to file the
required monthly reports and to pay the set-aside fees. Due to these reasons, the agency terminated Mr. Terry's license
in March 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Terry filed a grievance on April 26, 1988, regarding the termination of his license. He also sought financial relief
for the period prior to his termination during which the Sheriff permitted operations that competed with his facility.
The Hearing Officer and the TDHS Commissioner denied the complaint. The TDHS Commissioner found that the evidence
did not establish that Mr. Terry sustained damages because of the Sheriff's actions.

Mr. Terry then filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education on January 6, 1989, requesting arbitration.
The arbitration panel was convened, and the hearing was held in Knoxville, Tennessee, on September 21, 1990.

Arbitration Panel Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the substantive issues in this case, the panel agreed that Mr. Terry was harmed by the competing commissary and cigarette
machine established by the Sheriff, thereby diverting sales previously enjoyed by Mr. Terry. The panel also concluded
that Mr. Terry was partly responsible for the circumstances leading to his license termination because he was consistently
delinquent in filing his reports and in paying his fees. This conduct began prior to the Sheriff's actions. The panel
found that the adverse impact on Mr. Terry's facility was relevant to his inability to pay set-aside fees and to some
extent to the quality of his operations. Because of this adverse impact, the panel found that there was good cause for
the failure of Mr. Terry to pay the required set-aside fees. In determining damages due Mr. Terry, the panel took into
consideration the fact that Mr. Terry contributed to the circumstances that led to the termination of his license.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Terry claimed he was due damages in the amount of $400.00 per month from January 1987 through April 1988 (the month
of the termination of his license) or $6,400, and $1,500 for each month since the termination of his license or $49,500.
Because Mr. Terry's losses were caused in part by his own delinquencies, the panel ordered the SLA to pay Mr. Terry the
sum of $30,000, less set-aside fees he owes the agency in full and less his interim earnings in full. The arbitration
panel also ordered that Mr. Terry be reinstated in the program at a facility reasonably equivalent to the Public Safety
Building. The panel concluded that attorney's fees were allowable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel member selected by the SLA filed a dissenting opinion in which he maintained that the State was entitled to
the sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his opinion, the
State did not waive this immunity by participating in the Randolph-Sheppard program and did not have to pay monetary
damages.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed remedial investigation activities on the K&hyph;901
OU at K&hyph;25, prepared in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetlands Involvement was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 Fed Reg 51624 (October 4, 1993)] and a floodplain assessment was completed; no wetlands are involved in the proposed
action. DOE is proposing to conduct remedial investigation activities in characterize the site as to ground-water
quality, movement, and interaction with surface water and the types and levels of contaminants present and being
released from the OU. Surface water and sediment investigations would provide information to evaluate migration
pathway and contaminant load transported by the pathway. Soil investigation activities would focus on delineating
contamination within the OU and defining specific contaminant sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action employs various sampling techniques including: (1) installation of ground-water monitoring
wells; (2) drilling boreholes with a hollow-stem auger drilling rig; and (3) using hand augers and other manual sampling
methods. Some of the sampling activities associated with K&hyph;901 OU would be located in the 100-year floodplain
of the Clinch River. None of these activities would adversely impact the floodplain or measurably change flood levels.
Rather, implementation of the proposed action would have an overall positive effect on the environment and human
health by providing information to delineate contamination within the OU in order that remedial actions can be taken
to reduce the amount of contaminants entering the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drilling equipment access to some sampling sites may require some new gravel roads and the removal of some trees; however,
use of existing roadways and clearings would be optimized to reduce tree and vegetation removal. While most roadways
would be reclaimed and revegetated, some would be left in place to provide access to monitoring wells. In addition,
approximately 5 to 10 temporary drilling pads (25 ft &times; 25 ft &times; 1 ft) would be required; the land under these
pads would be reclaimed and revegetated at the conclusion of the action. Site access road construction and pad installation
activities would not measurably reduce the flood storage capacity of the floodplain, interfere with stream flow,
or produce hazardous flood velocities; therefore, no special mitigative measures would be required. Best management
practices, such as the placement of seals on the monitoring wells to prevent infiltration of surface water and the
mixing of ground water, would be implemented to ensure that only minimal amounts of disturbance to the floodplain
would occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two alternatives to the proposed action were considered_no action and the relocation of sampling locations outside
of the floodplain. Both alternatives would ensure no disturbance of the floodplain but would seriously impact efforts
to characterize the site, result in an unacceptable remedial action plan, and would not be protective of human health
or the environment because the nature and extent of contamination would not be fully known.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action has been designed to avoid or minimize impacts to the 100-year floodplain and no adverse impacts
to the floodplain are expected to occur. The proposed action does confirm to applicable State floodplain standards.
DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal was a solicited application. The Geothermal Resource Council, with headquarters in Davis, California,
is a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of California, has been funded in the past by the DOE-Geothermal
Program Office through a contract with Sandia National Laboratory. However, the Department believes that since
this effort is intended to benefit the United States public, that a grant mechanism is a more appropriate method of
providing funding. Competition for this effort would have an adverse effect on continuity and completion of the activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The programmatic evaluation [see 10 CFC 600.7(b)(2)(ii)(D)] completed for this proposal resulted in a recommendation
to fund this application for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``*&blank;*&blank;* providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology *&blank;*&blank;* necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information *&blank;*&blank;*'' (quotation from the Energy Mission Statement).
The Geothermal Resources Council (GRC) will do this by providing services to support the geothermal industry through
various activities and projects that are described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this financial assistance the GRC (a non-profit organization) will be able to continue to act as a focal point
for the geothermal industry. The objectives for this grant are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Develop Geothermal Poster_The poster will show the major components of geothermal resource development: history
occurrence, exploration, production, utilization, potential and its environmental advantageous. The poster
will be distributed to Junior and Senior high school and college students.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) GRC Annual Meeting_The DOE would be a sponsor for the annual GRC meeting where papers are presented and discussed.
At the 1993 annual GRC meeting, there were approximately 600 registered attendees and 60 vendors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Drilling School_Well Control Course_This course will certify regulators in well control, thereby helping to
ensure geothermal drilling operations are conducted in an environmentally sound manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Expansion of the GRC On-line Library_The current database will be enlarged by adding new citations and increasing
the keywords that can be searched for. The library will be a valuable tool for the geothermal community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Geothermal Heat Pump Training Center_Provide the seed money to design and construct a heat pump training center.
The training center would be used to train dealers, architects, engineers, students, etc. on topics such as Heating
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) basics of heat pumps, HVAC heat pump installation and service and ground
loop installation. The Geothermal Heat Pump Training Center would only be used for training purposes, no research
will be conducted at this site. The majority of the funding will be provided by utilities and heat pump manufacturers.

(6) World Solar Summit_Two GRC representatives will attend the World Solar Summit in Barcelona, Spain with the purpose
of establishing and maintaining foreign governmental and industrial contacts that are critical for the U.S. geothermal
export program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of meeting the objectives listed below are very high, given that the GRC has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff of the Geothermal Resources Council is uniquely qualified to provide this service. The GRC Staff is well
known and respected throughout the geothermal industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GRC's base of operations is in an office that is fully capable of meeting their needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major public benefit to be derived from the projects and activities are providing educational material to various
stakeholders (i.e., students, teachers, utilities, industry, and the public), and a technology transfer service
to the geothermal community. The services that are being provided through this grant are: Forums for presentation
and discussion of topics of general interest to the geothermal community; an educational program to keep well regulators
updated and certified, expansion of an on-line library which provides access to publications on geothermal energy,
as well as a list of geothermal power plants worldwide and a list of vendors of U.S. geothermal goods and services, assistance
in providing a training center for geothermal heat pumps which is a very efficient method of heating and cooling buildings,
and help in promoting the exportation of U.S. goods and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The services provided through the proposed grant are vital and strongly support the geothermal program's direction
and objectives. The Geothermal Resources Council, a Section 501 (c)(3) organization, is uniquely qualified and
positioned to perform the above mentioned tasks since the GRC is an accepted and respected industry organization.
The GRC has established an information network which is continually growing. The effort is a continuation of work
which has been funded by DOE and competition for this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity
of the proposed activities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy (DOE), DOE Chicago Operations Office, announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance
Rule, 10 CFR 600.14(f), it intends to award a grant based on the acceptance of an unsolicited application to the University
of Maryland at College Park. The objective of the work provided by this grant is to quantify the potential Electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) technique for heat transfer enhancement of in-tube condensation and in-tube evaporation processes of selected
ozone-safe refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The University of Maryland at College Park has the necessary personnel, facilities, and other resources to fully
perform the work set forth in the grant. Currently, this university is the only known group that has ongoing research
especially in the EHD augmentation of heat transfer in heat exchanger. Within the last six years the university has
maintained a comprehensive computer search of EHD-enhancement technology world-wide and the state-of-the-art
equipment for use in EHD and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) substitute research. This University also developed a unique
and innovative theoretical computer models to analyze the effects of new EHD configuration and effects. This application
is meritorious based on the general evaluation that it will support a DOE mission for the research and development
of highly efficient alternatives to, and substitutes for, environmentally harmful CFC and CFC-dependent euipment
used in refrigeration application and that it is relevant to the general public purpose of support in the areas of reducing
the effects of stratospheric ozone depletion. This application represents unique and innovative idea, method and
approach which would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation,
and, DOE has determined that, a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate. The project period for this grant
renewal is for a twenty-four month period expected to begin August 1, 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount
of $206,000.00 for this project period.

Woodman-Iannetti Oil Company filed an Application for Exception requesting exception relief from the requirement
that the firm file the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA&hyph;23, the ``Annual Survey of Domestic
Oil and Gas Reserves.'' In considering the Application for Exception, the DOE tentatively found that the firm was
not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a way that was significantly different than the burden by similar
reporting firms. Accordingly, on May 3, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception
request should be denied.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the disbursement of an escrow fund made available as a result of the termination
of exception relief issued to The 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The escrow fund, which is continuing to accrue
interest, totals approximately $131 million. OHA decided that refiners as a group absorbed 5.4 percent of the cost
of that exception relief. Each refiner listed on the Entitlements List for November 1980 will receive an allocable
share of the escrow fund based on its percentage of runs to stills during that month. Refiners' final refunds will be
based on the 5.4 percent absorption rate.

the period June 1974 through January 1981. Accordingly, the DOE granted Odessa a principal refund of $116,781 for
this product and accrued interest of $47,635. The total refund granted to Odessa was $164,416.

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (Goodyear), a major manufacturer and retailer of tires and industrial rubber
products, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision and Order that denied in part a crude oil refund application
it had filed. In its reconsideration request, Goodyear argued that the DOE had erroneously denied it a refund with
respect to its purchases of specified products. The DOE rejected Goodyear's arguments with respect to all the products
except isoprene. Although the DOE determined that isoprene was not an eligible product, the DOE further determined
that, for certain purchases, Goodyear had rebutted the end-user presumption of injury, i.e., the presumption that
the isoprene supplier, as the end-user of eligible products used to make isoprene, is presumed injured by crude oil
overcharges. The DOE based the latter determination on Goodyear's showing that for a portion of the refund period,
one of Goodyear's isoprene suppliers had increased isoprene prices to Goodyear based on a dollar for dollar increase
in its crude oil costs and, therefore, that for those purchases Goodyear bore the impact of overcharges attributable
to isoprene feedstocks. The DOE, therefore, granted Goodyear an additional crude oil refund in the amount of $3,554.

The DOE also considered two other products for which Goodyear had previously sought a crude oil refund but which the
DOE elected to defer in its earlier decision pending the submission of additional evidence by Goodyear. The two products
at issue were butadiene and petroleum wax. After reviewing the evidence and/or arguments Goodyear had presented,
the DOE determined that Goodyear had failed to demonstrate that the products in question had been produced in a crude
oil refinery. Accordingly, the DOE concluded that those products were not eligible for a crude oil refund.

Akin Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld (Akin Gump) filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the FOI and Privacy
Acts Branch, Reference and Information Management Division of the Department of Energy (DOE Headquarters) in response
to a request from Akin Gump under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Akin Gump sought the U.S.Russia Highly Enriched
Uranium Purchase Agreement signed by President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin (Purchase Agreement).
In considering the Appeal, the Office of Hearings and Appeals found that DOE Headquarters performed an adequate search
for the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied.

Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC) filed a Motion to Dismiss the underlying complaint and hearing request filed
by Helen ``Gai'' Oglesbee under the Department of Energy's Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 C.F.R. Part
708. On August 24, 1992, Oglesbee filed a complaint under Part 708 with the DOE Richland Field Office (DOE/RL) which
was forwarded to the Office of Contractor Employee Protection on October 2, 1992. In his Decision, the Hearing Officer
found that: (1) the OCEP Director did not abuse her discretion in accepting Oglesbee's complaint as timely filed;
(2) it was unnecessary to determine whether Oglesbee's complaint specifically met each of the criteria outlined
in 10 C.F.R. &sect;708.6, since the decision to accept a complaint is clearly within the discretion of the OCEP; (3)
WHC was not prejudiced by the OCEP's acceptance of the complaint. Accordingly, WHC's Motion was denied.

The DOE issued a Decision and Order implementing procedures for the distribution of $38,214.98, plus accrued interest,
in alleged overcharges obtained from County Fuel Company, Inc. These funds were remitted to settle possible pricing
violations in its sales of motor gasoline during portions of 1979 and 1980. The DOE determined that these funds will
be distributed in accordance with the DOE Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA).
Accordingly, Applications for Refund will be accepted from any party who purchased refined petroleum products during
the specified periods, March 1, 1979 through March 18, 1980. The specific information to be included in Applications
for Refund is included in the Decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed on behalf of the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation (Amtrak) in the crude oil overcharge special refund proceeding being conducted by the DOE under 10 C.F.R.
Part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claim was meritorious and granted a refund of $535,554. The
DOE denied the Objections filed by a group of States, finding that the econometric data submitted by the States did
not rebut the presumption that the Applicant was injured by the crude oil overcharges. In addition, the DOE denied
the Objections filed by a group of Utilities, Transporters, and Manufacturers, finding that (1) Even if Amtrak were
a government authority, it would still be eligible for a refund for its own purchases of refined petroleum products
and (2) because Amtrak was specifically excluded from the Settlement Agreement does not exclude it from the DOE's
crude oil refund proceeding.

Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District Nebraska Public Power District; Notice Extending Time to
Comment on Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 1, 1994, the Commission issued a revised draft environmental impact statement (RDEIS) on applications for
relicensing the Kingsley Dam Project No. 1417 and the North Plate/Keystone Diversion Dam No. 1835. These two hydropower
projects are located on the North Platte, South Platte, and Platte Rivers in Nebraska. Comments on the RDEIS are currently
due on July 25, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several parties have filed motions requesting or supporting an extension of time to comment on the RDEIS. Interior
seeks an extension until August 12, 1994, to submit comments on the RDEIS that will incorporate pulse flow recommendations
to be included in its revised recommendations under Section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act. EPA requests a conference
on water quality issues pursuant to its EIS review authority, and seeks a further extension of the comment period on
the RDEIS to September 8, 1994, to permit the conference to be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interior states that the pulse flow recommendations are its highest priority and, together with its other Section
10(j) recommendations, will form the basis for formal consultation with the Commission under Section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act. In view of the potential significance of Interior's recommendations in these proceedings, the extension
is reasonable and will be granted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Because all parties will benefit from a prompt ruling and it appears that no prejudice will result, this notice is being
issued in advance of the usual 15-day period for answers to Interior's motion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 18 CFR &sect;385.213(d). After reviewing the parties' comments on the RDEIS and Interior's revised Section 10(j)
recommendations, the Commission staff will determine how Interior's revised recommendations should be incorporated
into the EIS process and will provide an additional opportunity for comment, if appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA states that a conference is needed to assist the parties in evaluating the RDEIS and to discuss issues related to
water quality, such as minimum flows to meet water quality temperature standards and the Commission's role under
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. However, by letter dated July 12, 1994, Governor Nelson of Nebraska questioned
the need for a conference and informed the Commission that the State has no plans to change or reconsider its Section
401 certifications for these projects. In view of the general nature of EPA's request, the advanced stage of these
proceedings, and the information presented in Governor Nelson's letter, the Commission staff has determined that
there is no need for a conference on water quality issues as part of the EIS process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the RDEIS is extended to August 12, 1994. Anyone wishing to comment in writing on the RDEIS must
do so by that date. Comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Comments should clearly reference the Kingsley Dam Project No. 1417 and the North
Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam Project No. 1835 on the first page.

the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211 and 157.216) for authorization to
abandon certain undersized facilities at the Le Grande Meter Station in Union County, Oregon, and to construct and
operate upgraded replacement facilities at this station under Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northwest proposes to change the trim plates in the two existing 2-inch regulators from 50 percent trim to 100 percent
trim and add electronic flow measurement. Northwest also proposes to replace the existing 2-inch inlet piping and
valves with new 4-inch inlet piping and associated valves upstream of the regulators to resolve operational problems
that Northwest states it has been having with this meter station. Northwest states that these changes will increase
the maximum design delivery capacity of this meter station from 6,866 Dth per day to approximately 8,580 Dth per day
at a pressure of 200 psig. It is stated that these changes are necessary to better accommodate existing firm maximum
daily delivery obligations to the Washington Water Power Company at this point. Northwest estimates the total cost
of the proposed facility replacements at the Le Grande Meter Station to be approximately $279,550.

Take notice that on July 7, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188, Houston,
Texas 77251&hyph;1188, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;648&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to upgrade
an existing meter station under FGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;553&hyph;000 pursuant
to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGT proposes to upgrade the Cocoa Meter Station located in Brevard County, Florida by removing the first stage of regulation
and replacing the second stage of regulation. The meter station is used to measure gas deliveries to City Gas Company
of Florida (CGC). FGT states that the proposed upgrade would not change CGC's certificated levels of service, nor
would CGC's contractual gas quantities be increased. Therefore, the proposed upgrade would not impact FGT's peak
day or annual deliveries.

Take notice that on July 12, 1994, the General Services Administration (GSA), Denver Federal Center, Building 41,
Room 200, P.O. Box 25006, Denver, Colorado, 80225&hyph;006, filed an application pursuant to section 3 of the Natural
Gas Act, Executive Order No. 10485, as amended by Executive Order No. 12038; and Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;112
of the Secretary of Energy. GSA seeks a Presidential Permit for a point of entry for the importation of natural gas and
section 3 authority to construct, operate, maintain and connect natural gas import facilities. The proposed facilities
will extend from the Canadian border to the Piegan Immigration and Customs Station near Babb, Montana. GSA's proposal
is more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA says the import facilities will consist of 2,155 feet of 1 and one-half inch pipe. The proposed pipe will deliver
up to 146 Mcf per day to the Piegan Border Station and several adjacent Staff residences. The estimated cost of the facilities
is $12,500. The line will connect to the facilities of the Chief Mountain Natural Gas Cooperative, who will also build
a tap and meter in Canada. GSA says that natural gas service is needed to replace propane which currently fuels heating
equipment at the Piegan Border Station. GSA says the current propane heating system is sub-standard and violates
local mechanical codes. The GSA requests that the Commission grant this application on an expedited basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a motion to intervene or protest on or before
August 1, 1994, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All motions
to intervene or protests should be submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street,
N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. All protests filed will be considered, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene in accordance with Rule 214.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.
This notice announces receipt of 3 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each.

 EPA is announcing the availability of a study entitled ``Multiprocess Wet Cleaning: A Cost and Performance Comparison
of Conventional Dry Cleaning and an Alternative Process.'' The study is the result of a joint EPA/industry effort
that demonstrated the viability of an alternative non-solvent ``wet'' cleaning process which relies on soaps, heat,
steam and pressing to clean clothes that are traditionally dry cleaned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency's Design for the Environment Program within the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics formed a partnership
with the dry cleaning industry, universities, and environmental, labor, and consumer groups to explore ways to reduce
exposure to perchloroethylene (PCE), the chemical solvent used by most dry cleaners to clean clothes. In November
and December 1992, a short-term, high volume demonstration project was conducted to compare the cost and performance
of the alternative non-solvent process with traditional dry cleaning methods that use PCE. Results of the project
indicate that the wet cleaning process appears to be economically competitive and acceptable to consumers. The new
wet cleaning method, which can reduce the public's exposure to toxic dry cleaning chemicals, may be a viable alternative
for some of the nation's dry cleaners.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since 1984 EPA has undertaken various regulatory activities for the control of WET to protect aquatic life. In 1984,
EPA published the ``Policy for the Development of Water Quality-Based Permit Limitations for Toxic Pollutants.''
49 FR 9016 (March 9, 1984). The policy discusses such issues as integration of chemical specific and biological permit
limits; chemical, physical, and biological testing requirements (including WET testing requirements); and use
of data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, EPA revised the regulations governing the development of water quality-based effluent limitations, including
those to control WET. 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1). The regulations impose specific requirements such as requiring effluent
limits where the permitting authority finds ``reasonable potential'' to cause an exceedance of applicable water
quality criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, EPA revised the 1985 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (TSD). The new TSD provides an explanation of the technical support for WET testing and gives detailed guidance on
development of water quality-based permit limitations for WET and toxic pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon its accumulated experience in administering the WET control program to date, EPA decided to develop a new
WET control policy to supplement existing policy. The new policy consists of eight policy statements, explanations
of each policy statement, and appendices containing background materials. In part, the policy restates EPA's strong
continuing commitment to existing Clean Water Act provisions and the regulatory requirements at 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)
governing the control of WET for the protection of aquatic life. It also addresses some specific areas where questions
have arisen regarding the implementation of these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the eight statements of policy is provided below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Basis for WET Controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permitting authority should evaluate WET water quality criteria attainment for acute WET at the edge of the acute
mixing zone and for chronic WET at the edge of the chronic mixing zone except where the State has different requirements
for evaluating WET criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The permitting authority will develop WET effluent limitations based upon the more stringent of the acute or chronic
criterion applied at the edge of the respective mixing zone, or, alternatively, on both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout the policy, the term ``WET water quality criteria'' refers to State numeric water quality criteria for
WET and State narrative water quality criteria for toxicity such as ``no toxics in toxics amounts'' in State water
quality standards.

2. Evaluation of Dischargers for Reasonable Potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At a minimum, the permitting authority should review all major dischargers for reasonable potential to cause or contribute
to exceedance of WET water quality criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Evaluating Reasonable Potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permitting authority will consider available WET testing data and other information in evaluating whether a
discharger has reasonable potential to cause or contribute to exceedance of WET water quality criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Consequences of Establishing Reasonable Potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon finding reasonable potential to cause or contribute to exceedance of WET water quality criteria, the permitting
authority will impose effluent limitations to control WET.

Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994
funds for a sole source cooperative agreement with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO)
to continue educating State and territorial health officials in health effects of hazardous substances in the environment.
Approximately $75,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this cooperative agreement. It is expected that the award will
begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 3-year project period. Continuation awards
within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed cooperative agreement is to address the need to improve information exchange and transfer between State
and Federal agencies, and among State agencies; to increase training opportunities to help States improve the capacity
to conduct risk assessment and risk communication; to recommend a strategic plan to increase public and State health
professionals' awareness of the toxic pollution problems in the Great Lakes States, improve their ability to diagnose,
treat and manage illness or injury related to environmental problems, and enhance their ability to communicate health
risk information; and to build capacity to respond to community concerns by providing training and guidance in addressing
issues of community concern related to hazardous waste sites. Funding is to support a full time position to implement
and conduct these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATSDR will collaborate with the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk communication training programs,
Public Learning Institute, teleconference briefings, consultation service, newsletter column and materials;
and development, printing, and distribution of the national directory of risk assessors and environmental scientists.

ASTHO represents the chief public health official of each State and territory. Through its own membership, the ASTHO
Environment Committee, the Association of State and Territorial Health Risk Assessors (ASTHRA), other affiliate
organizations, and the Public Health Foundation, ASTHO has developed unique knowledge and understanding of the
needs and operations of State health agencies. Association members have already developed an enormous wealth of
experience in risk communication and have identified risk communication programs as a priority need for State health
agencies.

ASTHRA is an organization functioning under the umbrella of ASTHO and is composed of State health professionals involved
in health risk assessment. ASTHRA promotes information exchange between State level scientists and other professionals
who are responsible for environmental health risk assessments. States have varying capacity to meet the demand for
either developmental or sophisticated risk assessment. Improved information exchange, technology transfer,
and increased training opportunities will enhance the capacity of State health agencies to respond to the demand
for environmental services, information, and risk assessment. Therefore, a structure to improve the partnership
between ASTHO, ASTHRA, and ATSDR is essential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASTHO has advised ATSDR that the ASTHRA membership is the target audience to reach in supporting the continued development
of ASTHO's health risk assessment component. In 1993 through the cooperative agreement, ASTHO conducted six risk
communication workshops. It is anticipated that ASTHRA will continue these activities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For animal drug products,
the testing phase begins on the earlier date when either a major environmental effects test was initiated for the drug
or when an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective and runs until
the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the animal
drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory
review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may
award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent
was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for an animal drug product will include
all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(4)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the animal drug product Cattlyst

to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Cattlyst
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50 Type A Medicated Article (U.S. Patent No. 4,431,665) from Syntex (U.S.A), Inc., and requested FDA's assistance
in determining the patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated May 19, 1994, advised
the Patent and Trademark Office that this animal drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the
approval of Cattlyst
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50 Type A medicated Article represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter,
the Patent and Trademark Office requested that the FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Cattlyst
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50 Type A Medicated Article is 4,253 days. Of this time, 3,762 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory
review period, while 491 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following
dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: July 14, 1982. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational new animal drug application
(INAD) became effective was July 14, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 512(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: October 30, 1992. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the new animal drug application (NADA) for
Cattlyst
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50 Type A Medicated Article (NADA 141&hyph;025) was initially submitted was October 30, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: March 4, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NADA 141&hyph;025 was approved on March 4, 1994. This determination
of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent
extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 3 years of patent term extension. Anyone
with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before September 20, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before January 25, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of eight compliance policy guides (CPG's) because
either they are outdated, their issues are addressed elsewhere, or they no longer reflect current FDA policy. This
action is being taken to ensure that FDA's CPG's are accurate and reflect FDA policy and sound scientific principles.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA is revoking eight of its CPG's because either they are outdated, their issues are addressed elsewhere, or they
no longer reflect current FDA policy. The following eight guides are being revoked:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) CPG 7125.02 ``Quantity of Contents Declaration on Labels of Liquid Animal Feeds''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPG 7125.02 was established in 1980 under the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205b) to clarify FDA's preference
for metric labeling for liquid animal drugs. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 was amended by the American Technology
Preeminence Act of 1991 (ATPA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;245). Section 107 of the ATPA amended the Fair Packaging and Labeling
Act (FPLA) (15 U.S.C. 1451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) to require that the most appropriate metric units be used as the primary system for expressing quantity of content.
Section 107 of the ATPA was repealed by Pub. L. 102&hyph;329, which provided certain technical amendments to the FPLA,
including dual (metric and English) labeling and certain exemptions. These amendments provide a more appropriate
basis for metric labeling. Therefore, CPG 7125.02 is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) CPG 7125.04 ``Diethylcarbamazine''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 CPG 7125.04 was established to provide monograph criteria for diethylcarbamazine-containing drugs instead of
requiring new animal drug application (NADA) approval. Since establishing this CPG, FDA has determined these products
are not exempt from the NADA approval process. Therefore, CPG 7125.04 no longer reflects FDA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) CPG 7125.07 ``Impact of CGMPR Violations on NADA''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Center for Veterinary Medicine has routinely been involved in reviewing results of inspections and district
endorsements involving NADA's and abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADA's). For those facilities unable
to manufacture in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's), approval of applications was
delayed pending reinspection and satisfactory corrective action. Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7368.001,
part V, describes district responsibilities in reporting their findings for preapproval inspections. The current
CPGM is adequate to cover this issue of CGMP noncompliance in the preapproval stage. Therefore, CPG 7125.07 is superfluous.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) CPG 7125.08 ``Hexachlorophene in Pet Shampoos''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Pet shampoos are considered grooming aids if they contain hexachlorophene at not more than 0.1 percent (as a preservative)
and are not labeled with therapeutic claims. CPG 7125.21 ``Animal Grooming Aids'' and 21 CFR 500.46 adequately address
the issues. Therefore, CPG 7125.08 is not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) CPG 7126.15 ``Crotolaria Seeds in Grains and Feeds''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At FDA's urging, the feed industry has become meticulous in inspecting incoming raw ingredients for foreign materials,
including crotolaria seeds. Crotolaria, although once a nuisance and a toxin, has not been a compliance problem for
years. Therefore, CPG 7126.15 is no longer relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) CPG 7126.30 ``Diethylstilbestrol Residues in Edible Animal Tissue''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The approval for use of Diethylstilbestrol in animal drugs or feeds was withdrawn in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 6, 1979 (44 FR 39618 at 39619), as confirmed by the Commissioner's decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 21, 1979 (44 FR 54852 at 54900). Therefore, CPG 7126.30 is obsolete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) CPG 7126.32 ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Violations in Medicated Feed Mills_Direct Issuance
of Regulatory Letters''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7371.004 describes current policy concerning warning letters and provides
model letters. Therefore, CPG 7126.32 is obsolete because it describes regulatory letters that are no longer issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) CPG 7126.39 ``Ammonium Chloride Used in Ruminant Feeds''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPG 7126.39 concerned a formerly approved use of ammonium chloride in 21 CFR 558.45 for treating urinary calculi (see
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 3, 1986 (51 FR 7382 at 7395)), which has since been withdrawn (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 26, 1987 (52 FR 39911 at 39912). There are no approved drug claims for use of ammonium chloride in ruminant
feed and the agency has not documented any evidence of misuse of the compound in several years. Therefore, CPG 7126.39
is obsolete.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 31, 1987 (52 FR 49589) FDA announced the availability of a compilation of seven guidelines entitled ``General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals.'' The compilation was issued
in accordance with FDA's requirement under the general safety provisions of sections 409, 512, and 706 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to determine whether each food additive, new animal drug, or color additive
proposed for use in food-producing animals is safe for those animals and whether the edible products derived from
treated animals are safe. The pertinent regulations implementing the statutory provisions are in 21 CFR part 70,
21 CFR 514.1, and 21 CFR part 570.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the act, the sponsor of a compound is required to furnish FDA with the scientific data necessary for demonstrating
that residues of the sponsored compound in the edible products of treated animals are safe. The compilation was developed
to inform sponsors of the scientific data that FDA believes will provide an acceptable basis for determining the safety
of the compound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines state procedures or practices that may be useful to the persons to whom they are directed, but are not legal
requirements. Guidelines represent the agency's position on a procedure or a practice at the time of their issuance.
A person may follow a guideline or choose to follow alternate procedures or practices. If a person chooses to use alternate
procedures or practices, then that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure
of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable to FDA. A guideline does not bind the
agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. When a guideline states
a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not changed
in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is announcing the availability of a new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new guideline sets out new consumption values that FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) will use in partitioning
the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for drug residues among the edible products of food producing animals. The new daily
consumption values for total red meats and poultry, across all species, are 300 grams (g) of meat (as muscle tissue),
100 g of liver, 50 g of kidney, 50 g of fat, 100 g of eggs, and 1.5 liters (l) of milk. These values are a more realistic estimate
of actual food consumption than the values currently used by CVM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CVM will continue to regulate eggs and milk as independent commodities, which means that these products are not considered
components of the 500 g of edible muscle and organ tissues. The intake estimate of milk will remain 1.5 l. CVM will now
assume, however, that an individual consumes an entire portion of meat and edible tissues and an entire portion of
milk on a daily basis. Therefore, a part of the ADI will be reserved for milk when evaluating products approved in lactating
dairy cows and products seeking approval in both lactating dairy cows and another animals species. The other part
of the ADI will be partitioned among the animal tissues as described above. For products approved in both laying hens
and other animals, a part of the ADI will be reserved for eggs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to incorporating the new food factors, the concept of negligible tolerance has been omitted from the new
guideline because CVM usually can establish a finite or zero tolerance when assessing the safety of a drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, at any time, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on
the guideline. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments
may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Received comments will be considered in determining whether further revision of the guideline is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the compilation which includes the new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration,''
is available for public examination in the office above, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that fiscal year 1994 funds have been awarded
to States and territories (hereinafter States) for the HIV Care Grant Program. Although these funds have already
been awarded to the States, HRSA is publishing this notice to inform the general public of the existence of the funds.
In addition, HRSA determined that it would be useful for the general public to be aware of the structure of the HIV Care
Grant Program and the statutory requirements governing the use of the funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds will be used by the States to improve the quality, availability, and organization of health care and support
services for individuals and families with HIV infection. The HIV Care Grant Program was authorized by Title II of
the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;381, which amended
Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act. Funds were appropriated under Public Law 103&hyph;112.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The public health agency that is administering the grant for the State will conduct public hearings concerning
the proposed use and distribution of the Title II grant assistance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State will, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that HIV-related health care and support services
delivered with Title II assistance will be provided without regard to the ability of the individual to pay for such
services and without regard to the current or past health condition of the individual; ensure that such services will
be provided in a setting that is accessible to low-income individuals with HIV disease, and provide outreach to inform
such individuals of the services available; and, in the case of a State that intends to use grant funds for the continuation
of health insurance coverage, ensure that the State has established a program that assures that such amounts will
be targeted to individuals who would not otherwise be able to afford health insurance coverage, that income, assets,
and medical expense criteria will be established and applied by the State to identify those individuals who qualify
for assistance, and that information concerning such criteria will be made available to the public;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;The State will maintain HIV-related activities at a level that is equal to not less than the level of such expenditures
by the State for the 1-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State applied to receive a grant under Title
II; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State will ensure that grant funds are not utilized to make payments for any item or service to the extent
that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to that item or service (1) under any
State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program, or
(2) by an entity that provides health services on a prepaid basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States may use the HIV Care Grant funds to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establish and operate HIV care consortia within areas most affected by HIV. The statute defines a consortium
as an association of one or more public, and one or more nonprofit private health care and support service providers
and community-based organizations operating within areas determined by the State to be most affected by HIV disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide home- and community-based care services for individuals with HIV disease. Funding priorities must
be given to entities that provide assurances to the State that they will participate in HIV care consortia if such consortia
exist within the State, and will utilize the funds for the provision of home- and community-based services to low-income
individuals with HIV disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide assistance to assure the continuity of health insurance coverage for low-income (as defined by the
State) individuals with HIV disease. The State must establish a program that assures that (1) funds will be targeted
to individuals who would not otherwise be able to afford health insurance coverage, and (2) income, asset, and medical
expense criteria will be established and applied by the State to identify those individuals who qualify for assistance,
and information concerning such criteria shall be made available to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide treatments that have been determined to prolong life or prevent serious deterioration of health for
low-income individuals with HIV disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State must use at least 15 percent of its grant funds to provide health and support services to infants, children,
women and families with HIV disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At least 75 percent of the fiscal year 1994 Title II grant awarded to a State must be obligated to specific programs and
projects and made available for expenditure within 120 days of the receipt of the grant by the State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that fiscal year 1994 funds have been awarded
to the 34 eligible metropolitan areas (EMAs) that have been the most severely affected by the HIV epidemic. Although
these funds have already been awarded to the EMAs, HRSA is publishing this notice to inform the general public of the
existence of the funds. In addition, HRSA determined that it would be useful for the general public to be aware of the
structure of the HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program and the statutory requirements governing the use of the funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes of these funds are to deliver or enhance HIV-related (1) outpatient and ambulatory health and support
services, including case management and comprehensive treatment services, for individuals and families with HIV
disease; and (2) inpatient case management services that prevent unnecessary hospitalization or that expedite
discharge, as medically appropriate, from inpatient facilities. The HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program was authorized
by Title I of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;381, which
amended Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act. Funds were appropriated under Public Law 103&hyph;112.

Grants were awarded to the chief elected official (CEO) of the city or urban county in each EMA that administers the
public health agency providing outpatient and ambulatory services to the greatest number of individuals with AIDS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible for assistance under Title I, the CEO was required to establish or designate an HIV health services planning
council to: (1) establish priorities for the allocation of funds within the eligible area; (2) develop a comprehensive
plan for the organization and delivery of health services described in the statute that is compatible with any State
or local plan regarding the provision of health services to individuals with HIV disease; and (3) assess the efficiency
of the administrative mechanism in rapidly allocating funds to the areas of greatest need within the eligible area.
The planning council must include representatives of: health care providers; community-based and AIDS service
organizations; social services providers; mental health services providers; local public health agencies; hospital
planning agencies or health care planning agencies; affected communities, including individuals with HIV disease;
non-elected community leaders; State government; and grantees receiving categorical grants for early intervention
services under Title III of the CARE Act. The allocation of funds and services within the EMA must be made in accordance
with the priorities established by the planning council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to receive a grant under Title I, the EMAs were required to submit an application containing such information
as the Secretary required, including assurances adequate to ensure: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That funds received would be utilized to supplement not supplant State funds provided for HIV-related services;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That the political subdivisions within the EMA would maintain HIV-related expenditures at a level equal to
that expended for the 1-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the grant was received. Funds received
under Title I may not be used in maintaining the required level of expenditures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That the EMA has an HIV health services planning council and has entered into intergovernmental agreements
with the political subdivisions and has developed or will develop a comprehensive plan for the organization and delivery
of health services, in accordance with the legislation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That entities within the EMA that receive Title I funds will participate in an established HIV community-based
continuum of care if such continuum exists within the EMA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That Title I funds will not be utilized to make payments for any item or service to the extent that payment has
been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to that item or service (1) under any State compensation
program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program, or (2) by an entity that
provides health services on a prepaid basis; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To the maximum extent practicable, that HIV health care and support services provided with Title I assistance
will be provided without regard to the ability of the individual to pay for such services, and without regard to the
current or past health condition of the individual. Such services will be provided in a setting that is accessible
to low-income individuals with HIV disease, and a program of outreach will be provided to inform such individuals
of such services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Sections 2905 and 2906 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, P.L. 103&hyph;160
(Pryor Act Amendment) and with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance
Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property

also published in order to comply with the April 21, 1993 Court Order in

These properties reviewed are listed as suitable/available and unsuitable. In accordance with the Pryor Act Amendment
the suitable properties will be made available for use to assist the homeless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Please be advised, in accordance with the provisions of the Pryor Act Amendment, that if no
expressions of interest or applications are received by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during
the 60 day period, these properties will no longer be available for use to assist the homeless. In the case of buildings
and properties for which no such notice is received, these buildings and properties shall be available only for the
purpose of permitting a redevelopment authority to express in writing an interest in the use of such buildings and
properties. These buildings and properties shall be available for a submission by such redevelopment authority
exclusively for one year. Buildings and properties available for a redevelopment authority shall not be available
for use to assist the homeless. If a redevelopment authority does not express an interest in the use of the buildings
or properties or commence the use of buildings or properties within the applicable time period such buildings and
properties shall then be republished as properties available for use to assist the homeless pursuant to Section 501
of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS,

5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443&hyph;2265. (This is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the
interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In
order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions
of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged
to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the

The existing plan does not identify these lands for disposal. However, expressions of interest have been received
from Grand County and members of the public that appear to have merit and the disposal of which may be in the public interest.
Therefore, they will be considered through the plan amendment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General issues to be addressed in the amendment include impacts of the proposed disposals to livestock forage, wildlife
habitat, cultural resources, visual resources, and public safety. Site-specific environmental assessments will
be prepared at such time that a specific disposal is being considered.

This notice announces changes in benefit period eligibility under the Extended Benefit (EB) Program for the States
of Washington and Maine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following changes have occurred in the States of Washington and Maine since the publication of the last notice
regarding States' EB status:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;May 29, 1994 Washington State triggered ``on'' to EB based on its 13-week Insured Unemployment Rate (IUR) exceeding
5.0 percent and surpassing 120 percent of the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week periods in each of
the preceding two calendar years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;June 25, 1994 The EB trigger mechanisms for Maine have been below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on''
to EB since the week beginning May 1, 1994. However, Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment
Compensation Act of 1970 specifies that no EB period shall last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether
or not the necessary thresholds are met. That 13-week period ended for Maine on June 25, 1995.

Information for Claimants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The duration of benefits payable in the EB Program, and the terms and conditions on which they are payable, are governed
by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended, and the operating instructions
issued to the States by the U.S. Department of Labor. In the case of a State beginning an EB period, the State employment
security agency will furnish a written notice of potential entitlement to each individual who has exhausted all rights
to regular benefits and is potentially eligible for extended benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(1)). In the case of a Stat
ending an EB period, the State employment security agency will furnish a written notice to each individual who is filing
claims for Extended Benefits informing them of the ending of the EB period and its effect on the individual's right
to Extended Benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(4)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who believe they may be entitled to EB benefits, or who wish to inquire about their rights under the programs,
should contact the nearest State employment Service office of unemployment compensation claims office in their
locality.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency have an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is to advise all interested parties that the Department of Labor is withdrawing, from the date of this notice,
General Wage Determination No. ND94&hyph;0055 dated April 29, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies with construction projects pending, to which this wage decision would have been applicable, should utilize
Wage Decision ND940027. Contracts for which bids have been opened shall not be affected by this notice. Also, consistent
with 29 CFR 1.6(c)(2)(i)(A), when the opening of bids is less than ten (10) days from the date of this notice, this action

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wyle Laboratories (WL), a publicly-held corporation, was founded in 1949 in El Segundo, California, as an independent
test laboratory to support the aerospace industry. In 1959, Wyle expanded to a new location in Norco, California and
created the Huntsville facility in 1962 to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and
the establishment of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, with testing, engineering,
and research capabilities. Of the three major operations at the Huntsville facility, the one of interest to the NRTL
Accreditation program is the Test Operations Division, which includes the Product Safety Department. The Product
Safety Testing and Certification Department of the Test Operations Division is responsible for the testing, certification,
and factory follow-up inspections of the products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories applied to OSHA for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory in April 1992. An
on-site evaluation was conducted from November 2&hyph;6, 1992, and the results discussed with the applicant who
responded [Ex. 3A(2)] with appropriate actions and clarifications to recommendations made as a result of the survey
[Ex. 3A(1)]. These actions were accomplished prior to the preparation of the final report. The final on-site review
report (Ex. 3A) consisting of the on-site evaluation of WL's testing facilities and administrative and technical
practices, and the corrective actions taken by WL in response to these evaluations, and the OSHA staff recommendation,
were subsequently forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for a preliminary finding on the application. A notice of
WL's application together with a positive preliminary finding was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 783&hyph;785). There were eight responses, all of a positive nature, to this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of the WL application and preliminary finding (Docket No. NRTL&hyph;1&hyph;93).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has evaluated the entire record in relation to the regulations
set out in 29 CFR 1910.7 and makes the following findings:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1910.7(b)(1) states that for each specified item of equipment or material to be listed, labeled or accepted,
the laboratory must have the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written
testing procedures, and calibration and quality control programs) to perform appropriate testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The on-site review report indicates that WL does have testing equipment and facilities appropriate for the areas
of recognition it seeks. The laboratory has available all the general test equipment required to perform the testing
required by the particular standards for which accreditation is sought. If any unique pieces of additional equipment
are necessary, WL will obtain them as required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
WL's laboratory has adequate floor space for testing and evaluation and an adequate number of technical and professional
personnel to accomplish the services required for the present workload in the areas of recognition it seeks. Environmental
conditions in the laboratory are adequately controlled for the type of testing performed in the laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that Wyle Laboratories has appropriate written test procedures, and calibration and quality
control programs to enable it to adequately perform appropriate testing.

Creditable Reports/Complaint Handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1910.7(b)(4) provides that an OSHA recognized NRTL must maintain effective procedures for producing creditable
findings and reports that are objective and without bias. The laboratory, in order to be recognized, must also maintain
effective procedures for handling complaints under a fair and reasonable system. Wyle Laboratories meets these
criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL's application as well as the on-site review report indicate that WL does maintain effective procedures for producing
creditable findings and reports that are objective. The laboratory maintains a system for identifying product samples
submitted for testing to ensure that there is no confusion regarding the identity of the samples or the results of the
measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories' Standard Operating Procedure documents the investigation and testing for product safety investigations.
These standard operating procedures specify the records that are to be maintained for the investigation, list the
general steps of the investigation in chronological order, specify the personnel responsible for conducting each
stage of the investigation, and require the investigators to verify that the latest edition of the standards are used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories has a written Appeals Procedure which provides an unbiased review of questions or protests regarding
the results or process of Wyle Laboratories' Product Safety Certification Program by a client or any interested third
party.

Type of Testing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard contemplates that testing done by NRTLs fall into one of two categories: testing to determine conformance
with appropriate test standards, or experimental testing where there might not be one specific test standard covering
the new product or material. WL has applied for recognition in the first category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Follow-Up Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1910.7(b)(2) requires that the NRTL provide certain follow-up procedures, to the extent necessary, for
the particular equipment or material to be listed, labeled, or accepted. These include implementation of control
procedures for identifying the listed or labeled equipment or materials, inspecting the production run at factories
to assure conformance with test standards, and conducting field inspections to monitor and assure the proper use
of the label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wyle Laboratories performs inspections of factory production runs to assure conformance with the appropriate product
safety standard and WL's Certification Report. The adequacy of the manufacturer's Quality Control Program will
be reviewed on the initial inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL's Follow-Up Services Agreement requires that it will have access, unannounced and unrestricted, to all facilities
where products may be fabricated, processed, or stored. Such inspections will be conducted at approximately three-month
intervals from the date of the initial inspection, (four times per year), depending upon production schedules. The
inspection is to assure that the product on the production line is identical to the product tested and approved for
labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedure states that unresolved discrepancies found during the follow-up inspections could result in forfeiture
of the right to apply the label, removal of the already affixed labels, and the recall of products sold with the label.
WL will retain the right to notify vendors, authorities, potential users, and others of the improper, or unauthorized,
use of its mark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL will conduct field inspections to monitor and assure the proper use of its certification mark after the products
are delivered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Independence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1910.7(b)(3) requires that an NRTL be completely independent of employers subject to the tested equipment
requirements and of any manufacturer or vendors of equipment or materials being tested. The applicant stated in it
application that it is in complete compliance with this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes, based upon an examination of the application with particular reference to the statements in Exhibit
2A(1), Section 3, pages 12 and 13, and the response (Ex. 4) to questions raised by the Office of the Solicitor, that Wyle
Laboratories is independent within the meaning of section 1910.7(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Test Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1910.7 requires that an NRTL use ``appropriate test standards'', which are defined, in part, to include any
standard that is currently designated as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety designated product
standard or an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test standard used for evaluation of products or
materials. As to the non-ANSI UL test standards for which WL has applied to test products to, OSHA previously had examined
the status of the Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) Standards for Safety and, in particular, the method of their
development, revision and implementation, and had determined that they are appropriate test standards under the
criteria described in 29 CFR 1910.7(c) (1), (2), and (3). That is, these standards specify the safety requirements
for specific equipment or classes of equipment and are recognized in the United States as safety standards providing
adequate levels of safety; they are compatible and remain current with periodic revisions of applicable national
codes and installation standards; and they are developed by a standards developing organization under a method providing
for input and consideration of views of industry groups, experts, users, consumers, governmental authorities,
and others having broad experience in the safety fields involved.

Final Decision and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon a preponderance of the evidence resulting from an examination of the complete application, the supporting
documentation, and the OSHA staff finding including the on-site report, OSHA finds that Wyle Laboratories has met
the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 to be recognized by OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to test and
certify certain equipment or materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, Wyle Laboratories is hereby recognized as a Nationally Recognized Testing
Laboratory subject to the conditions listed below. This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which,
under 29 CFR Part 1910, require testing, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, or certification, by a Nationally
Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limited to the use of the following test standards for the testing
and certification of equipment or materials included within the scope of these standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WL has stated that all the standards in these categories are used to test equipment or materials which may be used in
environments under OSHA's jurisdiction. These standards are all considered appropriate test standards under 29
CFR 1910.7(c):

The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, et al.; Perry Nuclear Power Plan, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;58, issued to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, et al. (the licensee), for operation
of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1, located in Lake County, Ohio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would revise the operating license to reflect the proposed merger of the Toledo Edison Company
into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. The two companies are currently wholly-owned subsidiaries of
the Centerior Energy Corporation. As described in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended
to be renamed. The name of the combined operating company has yet to be determined (hereinafter referred to as ``NEWCO'')
and the licensees indicate it will be provided by supplemental letter. The proposed amendment would (1) replace the
Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company with NEWCO as a licensee, (2) designate NEWCO
as owner of Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, and (3) make other associated changes to the license as indicated in the
amendment application. Centerior Service Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated June 2, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action in the form of an amendment application is needed to reflect the result of the proposed merger of
the Toledo Edison Company into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. This action is also intended to maximize
the operating efficiencies of the two affiliated companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that there will be no changes to the
facility or to the operating, maintenance, engineering or other nuclear-related personnel as a result of the proposed
merger and license amendment. The proposed merger would not change the technical qualifications and responsibilities
of personnel. All of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company personnel in the Perry organization would be transferred
to NEWCO upon completion of the merger. This organization would continue to report to Centerior Service Company.
After the merger, NEWCO and Centerior Service Company would be required to continue to operate, manage, and maintain
the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, in accordance with the conditions and requirements of the NRC. No changes resulting
from the merger are expected with regard to the following: lines of authority and responsibility, essential nuclear
support functions provided to Perry, effectiveness of the organization, priorities and ongoing plant improvement
projects, technical qualifications, and corporate financial resources presently available in support of Perry
operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect the nonradiological plant
effluents and has not other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, documented in NUREG&hyph;0884.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the Ohio State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The
State official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 2, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards; Consideration, Determination, and
Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;41, NPR&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee)
for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Maricopa County, Arizona.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would implement recommended changes from Generic Letter (GL) 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical
Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' Specifically,
the licensee proposed to change their Technical Specifications corresponding to the following GL 93&hyph;05 line
numbers: 4.1.2, 5.8, 5.14, 6.1, 7.5, 8.1, 9.1, 12, and 14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard 1_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated based on the safety analysis, because the proposed changes to the TS do not affect the assumptions,
design parameters, or results of any UFSAR accident analysis. The proposed amendment does not add or modify any existing
equipment. The changes to the surveillance requirements will result in an overall improvement in plant safety by
reducing the frequency of plant trips and subsequent challenges to the safety systems, decreasing equipment degradation
due to excessive testing, reducing radiation exposure to plant personnel (which is not justified by the safety significance
of the surveillance), and eliminating an unnecessary burden on plant personnel (time required for testing is not
justified by the safety significance of the testing). Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed since the proposed TS changes do not involve modifications to any of the existing equipment or affect the
operation or design basis of the equipment. The proposed changes increase the surveillance intervals for a small
fraction of the SR [surveillance requirement], while ensuring that overall plant safety is improved. Therefore,
the proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety presently provided is not reduced by the proposed changes in surveillance intervals in this TS
amendment. The operability requirements of the affected systems, structures, and components are not changed by
this TS amendment. Although the proposed changes increase the surveillance intervals for the affected TS, the reliability
and operability of systems, components, and structures continues to be ensured by periodic testing. Since equipment
reliability and operability will be maintained, the proposed TS changes will not involve a significant reduction
in margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By August 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix,
Arizona 85004. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

John W. Boomer has been a nuclear medicine technologist since 1972. On February 11, 1993, Mr. Boomer, as the President
of Chesapeake Imaging Center, Inc. (CIC or Licensee) applied for an NRC license. On March 23, 1993 Materials License
No. 47&hyph;25238&hyph;01 was issued to CIC by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to
10 CFR parts 30 and 35. The license authorized the possession and use of radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine
activities in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The license was terminated this date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 30, 1993, the NRC conducted an initial inspection of CIC at its facility located in Chesapeake, West Virginia.
As a result of the inspection, multiple violations of NRC requirements were identified. One specific violation identified
involved the failure to perform weekly surveys for removable contamination in the nuclear medicine department between
March 24 and July 30, 1993. As a result of this inspection, a Notice of Violation is being issued contemporaneously
with this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between August 3 and September 30, 1993, an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) to
determine if certain violations identified during the July 30, 1993, inspection were the result of deliberate misconduct.
Based on investigative findings, the NRC staff concludes that Mr. Boomer deliberately caused CIC to violate the requirement
to perform the weekly contamination surveys, after being advised by the CIC facility Manager and CIC technical consultant
that such surveys were required. Mr. Boomer was aware of the NRC requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys,
yet deliberately failed to meet the requirement in violation of 10 CFR 35.70(e) and 10 CFR 30.10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transcribed telephone enforcement conference between the NRC staff and Mr. Boomer was held on March 8, 1994. Mr.
Boomer indicated during the enforcement conference that he had significant difficulties in obtaining the funds
from investors and did not recognize the severity of the noncompliance but rather focused on the needs of patients
traveling miles to obtain the studies. Mr. Boomer also stated during the enforcement conference that he did accept
responsibility for not obtaining the equipment in a more timely fashion and for not notifying NRC and indicated that
he would exercise better judgment in the future. From the discussions at the enforcement conference, the staff believes
an order to remove Mr. Boomer from involvement in NRC-licensed activities is warranted based on (1) The deliberate
noncompliance with the NRC's weekly survey requirement, (2) the fundamental lack of assurance that he will in the
future comply with Commission requirements, (3) his position as President, (4) his approximate 20 years experience
in NRC-licensed activities, and (5) his decision to continue operations although he knew he was not in compliance
with the weekly survey requirement.

III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above, Mr. Boomer engaged in deliberate misconduct which caused the licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR
35.70(e). The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including
the requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys. Compliance with the NRC requirement to perform weekly
contamination surveys is necessary to protect members of the public as well as Licensee employees from unnecessary
radiation exposure that could result from undetected radioactive contamination. Performance of weekly contamination
surveys is an important safety requirement intended to prevent radioactive contamination of patients, employees
and other members of the public. Mr. Boomer's deliberate actions in causing the Licensee to violate these requirements
have raised serious doubts as to whether he can be relied on to be involved in NRC-licensed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance
with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected if Mr. Boomer were
permitted at this time to be involved in NRC-licensed activities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest
require that Mr. Boomer be prohibited from any involvement in NRC-licensed activities for a period of three years
from the date of this Order, and if he is currently involved with another licensee in NRC-licensed activities, he must
immediately cease such activities, and inform the NRC of the name, address and telephone number of the employer, and
provide a copy of this order to the employer. During this period Mr. Boomer also shall be required to provide a copy of
this Order to any prospective employer who engages in NRC-licensed activities prior to the time that Mr. Boomer accepts
employment with such prospective employer. The purpose of this notice is so that any prospective employer is aware
of Mr. Boomer's prohibition from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. Additionally, Mr. Boomer is required to notify
the NRC of his first employment in NRC-licensed activities following the prohibition period. Furthermore, pursuant
to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of Mr. Boomer's conduct described above is such that the public health,
safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Co., et al.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPR&hyph;5, issued to the Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee), for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit
2, located in Appling County, Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.6.6 for Hatch Unit 2 to permit the traversing
incore probe (TIP) system to be considered operable with less than four operable TIP machines. The TIP system is used
to periodically determine the power distribution in the core, for the calibration of the local power range monitor
(LPRM) detectors, and for monitoring core thermal limits: the average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR),
the linear heat generation rate (LHGR), and the minimum critical power ratio (MCPR).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will also allow the utilization of substitute TIP data for the inaccessible locations from
either symmetric TIP locations or from normalized TIP data as calculated by the online core monitoring system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the July 19, 1994, submittal, the licensee stated that, on July 11, 1994, with Hatch Unit 2 operating at 100% rated
thermal power, Plant Hatch shift personnel were performing the procedure for the TIP normalization required to be
performed every 31 effective full power days. Nearing completion of the procedure, personnel were unable to place
the ``D'' TIP into channel 9. It had apparently stuck in channel 8, indicating a problem with the indexing mechanism.
The indexing mechanism is located inside the primary containment (drywell), access to which is not possible at the
present power level. Based on the last successfully performed LPRM calibration, the next one is to be completed no
later than August 9, 1994. If the surveillance is not performed by that time, it will be necessary to declare the APRMs
inoperable and, thus, enter an immediate reactor shutdown in accordance with TS 3.3.1.b, Action 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The problem with the ``D'' TIP could not have been foreseen, although Plant Hatch has had problems with the indexing
mechanism in the past. However, each problem is unique and has a different root cause. Subsequent to the discovery
of the problem, efforts to return the ``D'' TIP to operable status were initiated. These efforts were led by the licensee's
engineering staff with vendor representatives on-site as well. The licensee has performed several tests which included
verification of proper voltage to the indexer motor, verification of proper motor winding resistance as well as over-voltage
tests on the indexing mechanism, and also conducted a reverse motor test in an attempt to free the indexer; however,
this attempt was unsuccessful. All the licensee's efforts to repair the TIP, without drywell access, were exhausted
on Friday, July 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TIP system is not used to prevent, or mitigate the consequences of, any previously analyzed accident or transient,
nor are any assumptions made in any accident analysis relative to the operation of the TIP system. No other safety related
system is affected by this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of substitute values from symmetric TIP locations or from calculations performed by the on-line computer
core monitoring system does not affect the consequences of plant transients previously evaluated in the FSAR [Final
Safety Analysis Report], because the total core TIP reading (nodal power) uncertainty is less than 8.7%. Thus, the
MCPR safety limit is not affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve the installation of any new equipment, or the modification of any equipment designed
to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents or transients. Therefore, the change has no effect on any accident
initiator, and no new or different type of accidents are postulated to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed amendment does not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The total core TIP reading uncertainties will remain with the assumptions of the licensing basis, thus, the margin
of safety to the MCPR safety limits is not reduced. The ability of the computer to accurately represent nodal powers
in the reactor core is not compromised. The ability of the computer to accurately predict the LHGR, APLHGR, MCPR, and
its ability to provide for LPRM calibration, is not compromised. Therefore, the margin of safety is not significantly
reduced.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publication Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By August 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Appling County Public Library, 301 City Hall Drive, Baxley,
Georgia 31513. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

Options Price Reporting Authority; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of an Amendment to the National
market System Plan of OPRA Relating to Exemptions form OPRA's Indirect Access Fee for Certain Subscribers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on
June 27, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``SEC'' or ``Commission'') an amendment to the Plan for Reporting of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and
Quotation Information (``Plan''), exempting from OPRA's Indirect Access Fee those subscribers who receive a data
feed transmission of options market information from an OPRA vendor on a single stand-alone computer for the sole
purpose of providing a single-screen display of options information for the subscriber's own internal use. OPRA
has designated this proposal as concerned solely with an existing fee, permitting it to become effective upon filing,
pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(3)(ii) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
from interested persons on the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed amendment is to respond to recent and ongoing changes in computer and communications technology
that have resulted in an ever greater number of OPRA subscribers choosing to receive options information in the form
of a bulk data feed transmission from a vendor, rather than as a vendor-controlled interrogation or display service.
At the time the Subscriber Indirect Access Fee was first adopted, only a relatively few large subscribers received
a data feed transmission, usually to serve multiple terminals in a network. The Subscribers Indirect Access Fee was
intended to allocate to these subscribers OPRA's higher administrative costs associated with providing access
to subscribers whose terminal population is not under vendor control. Recent changes in computer and communications
technology have now made it cost effective for an increasing number of smaller OPRA subscribers to access options
market information by means of vendor-provided, data-feed transmissions received on a single computer terminal.
Since such single-device data-feed subscribers do not subject OPRA to the higher costs associated with multiple
device counts and entitlements, OPRA has determined that it would more fairly allocated its costs through the fees
charged to various categories of users of options market information to exempt such single-device data feed subscribers
from the Subscriber Indirect Access Fee. Such subscribers will continue to be subject to OPRA's basic Subscriber
Fee, and the Indirect Access Fee will continue to apply to multiple terminal users of data feed transmissions.

Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(3), the amendment is effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission
may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling and approval of the amendment
by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(2), if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National Market System, or otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act.

I. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change modifies NSCC's clearing fund requirements for those NSCC members for which NSCC sponsors
an account at The Depository Trust Company (``DTC''). The modified requirements are designed to more accurately
reflect NSCC's risks associated with such sponsoring. The modified requirements also will be more consistent with
the way in which NSCC and DTC address similar risks associated with dual NSCC/DTC members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently under certain situations, NSCC applies a factor in calculating its clearing fund requirements for members'
non-continuous net settlement (``non-CNS'') activity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, envelope settlement system activity'').
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The DTC settlement activity of members which NSCC sponsors into DTC (``sponsored members'') is included in the non-CNS
calculation. The factor is applicable when a member's average daily envelope settlement system debits exceed the
member's excess net capital. For the reasons set forth below, NSCC desires to eliminate application of the factor
in the clearing fund calculation related to sponsored members' DTC settlement activity. In lieu thereof, NSCC has
determined to add an additional advisory surveillance criteria to its guidelines for placing a member on surveillance
status in order to cover circumstances where a sponsored member's average daily envelope settlement system debits
plus its average daily DTC settlement debits exceed the sponsored member's excess net capital.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The factor is a number, calculated and adjusted in order to provide a minimum of one and a maximum of three, by which the
member's non-CNS clearing fund requirement is multiplied in order to increase the requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Advisory surveillance status permits NSCC, among other things, to increase a member's clearing fund requirement
2.5% (or in the discretion of NSCC up to 5%) of the member's average daily non-CNS and non-mutual fund services debits
plus 2.5% of the member's average daily non-CNS and non-mutual fund services credits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;82&hyph;10, NSCC amended its clearing fund formula to permit the collection of additional
clearing fund deposits from members using NSCC's envelope settlement system.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Calculation of the additional clearing fund deposits involved use of a factor. The primary purpose of the additional
clearing fund deposits and the use of a factor was to better protect NSCC against the risks presented by the envelope
settlement systems (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that securities delivered through the envelope settlement systems would not be available for return to the deliverer
in the event the receiver were to become insolvent and be unable to pay for the delivery). However, NSCC did not limit
the application of the factor to only the calculation of clearing fund requirements for physical envelope deliveries
but also applied it in the calculation of clearing fund requirements associated with the DTC settlement activity
of sponsored members.

NSCC believes that its current clearing fund formula, as applied to sponsored members, can result in excessive clearing
fund requirements. NSCC believes that the risk associated with sponsored members' DTC settlement activities will
be adequately addressed without the application of a factor. The proposed rule change, while eliminating the use
of a factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC settlement activity,
gives NSCC the ability to place a sponsored member on advisory surveillance status with an increased clearing fund
requirement under the circumstances where previously the factor would have been applied. Furthermore, NSCC will
continue to collect from each sponsored member a clearing fund deposit based not only on the member's NSCC settlement
activities but also based on its DTC settlement activities. The portion of NSCC's clearing fund deposit based on DTC
settlement activities generally will be the same amount the sponsored member would be required to deposit with DTC
for that DTC settlement activity if the sponsored member had a regular account at DTC.

For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with NSCC that the elimination of the factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund
requirement with respect to DTC settlement activity will more appropriately reflect the relevant risks and that
it will be consistent with the way in which DTC addresses settlement risks for its members. At the same time, the Commission
believes that the modified NSCC clearing fund formula provides for the collection of deposits adequate to protect
NSCC from the risks associated with the DTC settlement activities of sponsored members. Accordingly, the modified
clearing fund formula should result in a more equal distribution of the financial burdens placed on NSCC sponsored
members while allowing NSCC to fulfill its statutory safekeeping obligation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, particularly
with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;06)
be, and hereby is, approved.

1. Financial Horizons, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nationwide Life Insurance Company (``Nationwide Life''), is
a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Ohio. Financial Horizons established the Account on
July 24, 1991 to serve as a funding medium for certain individual deferred variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'')
issued by Financial Horizons. The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment
trust. The application incorporates by reference the registration statement, currently on file with the Commission
(File No. 33&hyph;66496), for the Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Nationwide, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nationwide Life, serves as the general distributor for the Contracts.
Nationwide is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer and as an investment advisor. Applicants also represent
that Nationwide is a member in good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contracts are sold either as nonqualified contracts or as individual retirement annuities which may quality
for special tax treatment under the provisions of Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Purchase payments may be allocated by the Contract owner to one or more subaccounts of the Account. Each subaccount
of the Account will invest at net asset value in shares of the corresponding mutual fund which is registered under the
1940 Act. Prior to the annuity commencement date, a Contract owner may elect any of three annuity payment options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Upon withdrawal of part or all of the Contract value, a contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'')
may be imposed by Financial Horizons. The Sales Charge is calculated by multiplying the applicable percentage by
the amount withdrawn and is deducted from the amount withdrawn. The Sales Charge will be applied as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. After the first Contract year, the owner of a Contract may withdraw an amount, free of Sales Charge, equal to 10% of
the sum of all purchase payments made to the Contract at the time of withdrawal less any purchase payments previously
withdrawn that were subject to a Sales Charge. This privilege is noncumulative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. An annual Contract maintenance charge of $30 is deducted from the value of the Contract. Additionally, an administration
charge equal on an annual basis to 0.05% of the daily net asset value of the Account is deducted from the value of the Contract.
This administration charge is deducted during both the accumulation and the annuity phases of the Contract. Applicants
represent that Financial Horizons estimates that the annual administration charge of 0.05% for expenses will yield
an amount considerably less than the current and projected future administrative costs of Financial Horizons, even
when this charge is added to the $30 annual Contract maintenance charge. Applicants state that they will rely on Rule
26a&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act in deducting both charges and that both charges are guaranteed not to increase. Applicants
further state that Financial Horizons will monitor to ensure that the charges do not exceed expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Financial Horizons will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
of the Account to compensate Financial Horizons for assuming certain mortality and expense risks in connection with
the Contracts. Approximately .80% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .45%
is attributable to expense risk. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and
assumed risk, Financial Horizons will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be
profit to Financial Horizons. If Financial Horizons realizes a profit from the charge, the profit will become part
of the general account of Financial Horizons and may be used in its discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Financial Horizons consists of: (a) The risk of guaranteeing
to make monthly payments for the lifetime of the annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant may live; and (b) the
risk of promising to pay a death benefit upon the death of the designated annuitant prior to the annuity commencement
date even where the investment experience in the Account has eroded the purchase payments made by the Contract owner.
Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Financial Horizons is the guarantee that the Contract maintenance
charge and the administration charge will never increase regardless of actual expense incurred by Financial Horizons.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality
and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit
investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates
unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian
and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not
exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative
services of a character normally preformed by the bank itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Financial Horizons under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Financial Horizons
is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this
representation is based upon the analysis by Financial Horizons of publicly available information relative to other
insurance companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar products. Applicants represent that Financial
Horizons will maintain a memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, setting forth in detail the products
analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. Financial Horizons also maintains
a supporting actuarial memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, demonstrating the reasonableness
of the mortality and expense risk charge given the risks assumed under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants represent that Financial Horizons has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed
distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion
is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Financial Horizons and will be made available to the Commission
upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants represent that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in
the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have
such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons
of such company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Company is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Minnesota. It is licensed to do business
in all States except New York (where it is an authorized reinsurer), the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Separate Account, registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act, is a segregated investment account
of the Company that funds the Contracts and other variable annuities contracts. The Separate Account is divided into
sub-accounts, each of which invests solely in the shares of one of the following management investment companies:
The Index 500 and Money Market Portfolios of MIMLIC Series Fund, Inc., Vanguard Wellington Fund, the Vanguard Long
Term Corporation Bond Portfolio of Vanguard Fixed Income Securities Fund, Inc., Scudder International Fund, Inc.,
Fidelity Contrafund, Inc., and Janus Twenty Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Contracts are group deferred variable annuity contracts designed to provide benefits under deferred compensation
plans of State and local governments and other tax-exempt organizations as provided in section 457 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In a typical plan, the sponsor or eligible governmental unit is the owner of the Contract
and will designate individuals eligible to become participants in the Contracts. The Contracts and all interests
under them are subject to the general interests of creditors of the owners of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. MIMLIC Sales Corporation, registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. There is an annual Contract administration charge of 0.15 that is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1. This
charge may be increased to 0.40% provided the charge could continue to be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge to be deducted from purchase payments. Instead, a contingent
deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') of up to 6% of the amount withdrawn or surrendered is charged. Applicants represent
that the sum of the CDSC charges deducted will not exceed 9% of purchase payments made by or on behalf of a participant.
The following table shows the applicable percentage for withdrawals or surrenders in the first month of each of the
first seven participation years:

7. The Company will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the average
daily net asset value of the Separate Account: approximately .60% for mortality risks and .85% for expense risks.
The current level of the proposed charge is 0.85%, of which 0.40% is for mortality risks and 0.45% is for expense risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortality risks assumed by the Company arise from its guarantees to make annuity payments as provided in the Contracts
regardless of how long a participant lives and regardless of any improvement in life expectancy of participants as
a class. Also, the Company bears mortality risks associated with the Contract's death benefit provision. The expense
risk assumed by the Company arise in connection with the Company's guarantees to make annuity payments in accordance
with annuity tables provided in the Contracts regardless of whether the Company's estimates of expenses is correct
over the life of the Contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or
underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited
with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing
bookkeeping and other administrative services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) exempting them from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940
Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Account under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice with respect
to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of publicly available information
about comparable products, taking into consideration such factors as any contractual right to increase charges
above current levels, the existence of other charges, the number of transfers permitted without charge and the ability
to make free withdrawals. The Company represents that it will maintain at its home office a memorandum, available
to the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. To the extent the CDSC is insufficient to cover the actual cost of distribution, the excess distribution costs will
be paid from the Company's general assets, including the profits, if any, from the mortality and expense risk charges.
The Company represents that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Separate Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum
maintained by the Company at its service office and available to the Commission upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Company represents that the Separate Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake,
in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, to have
a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19)
of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Account under the Contracts meet the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions
requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Program Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Soviet-Eastern European Research and Training Act of 1983 the Congress declared that independently verified
factual knowledge about the countries of that area is ``of utmost importance for the national security of the United
States, for the furtherance of our national interests in the conduct of foreign relations, and for the prudent management
of our domestic affairs.'' Congress also declared that the development and maintenance of such knowledge and expertise
``depends upon the national capability for advanced research by highly trained and experienced specialists, available
for service in and out of Government.'' The program provides financial support for advanced research, training and
other related functions on the countries of the region. By strengthening and sustaining in the United States a cadre
of experts on Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union, the program contributes to the
overall objectives of the FREEDOM Support and SEED programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The full purpose of the Act and the eligibility requirements are set forth in Pub. L. 98&hyph;164, 97 Stat. 1047&hyph;50,
as amended. The countries include Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia,
Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldava, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenergro, and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. (No funds may actually be spent in Serbia.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act establishes an Advisory Committee to recommend grant policies and recipients. The Secretary of State, after
consultation with the Advisory Committee, approves policies and makes final determinations on awards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for funding under the Act are invited from US organizations prepared to conduct competitive programs
on the independent states of the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe and related fields. Applying
organizations or institutions should have the capability to conduct 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
competitive award programs that are national in scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Programs of this nature are those that make awards which are based upon an open, nationwide competition, incorporating
peer group review mechanisms. Individual end-users of these funds_those to whom the applicant organizations or
institutions propose to make awards_must be at the graduate or post-doctoral levels, and must have demonstrated
a likely career commitment to the study of Eastern Europe and/or the independent states of the former Soviet Union.

Publications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 Funds awarded in this competition should not be used to subsidize journals, newsletters and other periodical publications
except in special circumstances, in which cases the funds should be supplied through peer-review organizations
with national competitive programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Conferences.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposals for conferences, like those for research projects and training programs, should be assessed according
to their relative contribution to the advancement of knowledge and to the professional development of cadres in the
fields. Therefore, requests for conference funding should be directed to one or more of the national peer-review
organizations receiving program funds, with proposed conferences being evaluated competitively against research,
fellowship or other proposals for achieving the purposes of the grant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Library Activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 Funds may be used for certain library activities which clearly strengthen research and training on the countries
of Eastern Europe and the independent States of the former Soviet Union and benefit the fields as a whole. Such programs
must make awards based upon open, nationwide competition, incorporating peer group review mechanisms. Funds may
not be used for activities such as modernization, acquisition, or preservation. Modest, cost-effective proposals
to facilitate research, by eliminating serious cataloging backlogs or otherwise improving access to research materials,
will be considered.

Language Support. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The Advisory Committee encourages attention to the non-Russian languages of the independent states of the former
Soviet Union and the less commonly taught languages of the East European countries. Support provided for Russian
language instruction/study normally will be only for advanced level. Applicants proposing to offer language instruction
are encouraged to apply to a national program as described above which has appropriate peer group review mechanisms.

Support for Non-Americans. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the program is to build and sustain U.S. expertise on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent
states of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, the Advisory Committee has determined that highest priority for support
always should go to American specialists (i.e., U.S. citizens or permanent residents). Support for such activities
as long-term research fellowships, i.e., nine months or longer, should be restricted solely to American scholars.
Support for short-term activities also should be restricted to Americans, except in special instances where the
participation of a non-American scholar has clear and demonstrable benefits to the American scholarly community.
In such special instances, the application must justify the expenditure.

In making its recommendations, the Committee will seek to encourage a coherent, long-term, and stable effort directed
toward developing and maintaining a national capability on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent states
of the former Soviet Union. Program proposals can be for the conduct of any of the functions enumerated, but in making
its recommendations, the Committee will be concerned to develop a balanced national effort which will ensure attention
to all the countries of the area. Legislation requires and this announcement indicates under

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Available Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Awards are contingent upon the availability of funds. Funding may be available at a level up to $10 million. The precise
level of funding will not be known until legislative action is complete. In Fiscal Year 1994, the Congress appropriated
to the program $10 million from the Agency for International Development budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department legally cannot commit funds that may be appropriated in subsequent fiscal years. Thus multi-year

In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received a request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested
and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amtrak is seeking a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Power Brakes and Drawbars Regulations,
49 CFR Part 232. Amtrak is requesting that it be permitted to extend the clean, oil, test and stencil (COT&amp;S) period
from 36 months to 48 months on all passenger cars equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26&hyph;C Brake Equipment. Section 232.17(b)(2) states_``Brake equipment on passenger cars must be clean, repaired,
lubricated and tested as often as necessary to maintain it in a safe and suitable condition for service but not less
frequently than as required in Standard S&hyph;045 in the Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices of the Association
of American Railroads (AAR).'' Paragraph 2.1.2 of Standard S&hyph;045 (AAR Manual Section A, Part III) currently
specifies 36 months for 26&hyph;C Type Brake Equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA Docket Number H&hyph;91&hyph;2 authorized Amtrak to conduct a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four year test of the 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment on 50 cars of their 103 Horizon car fleet built between May 1989 and January
1990. A tear down inspection of five representative cars was conducted after the four year service period. The test
has now been concluded and a final report indicating satisfactory performance of the brake equipment over the four
year test period has been issued. As a result of this performance, Amtrak has requested that the COT&amp;S period for
all cars with 26&hyph;C Brake Equipment be extended to 48 months.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of law that were contained in section 10 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;365),
simultaneously repealed and reenacted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4(t) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;272 on July 5, 1994, require that FRA assess the adequacy of existing locomotive crashworthiness
standards. At this open meeting, FRA's Office of Research and Development will present the methodology and the initial
results of the analysis. These first results are based on a model developed for this research project relying on engineering
data from existing locomotive designs. Using information gleaned from previous accidents, accident scenarios
are applied to the model. This analysis will be used to assess crashworthiness as required by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issues to be discussed have potential bearing on future FRA regulatory activities, this meeting will be
open to any interested person who may wish to observe. There will also be an opportunity for questions.

G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230CE (Model ID 124.043) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
300CE. G&amp;K has submitted information indicating that Daimler Benz A.G., the company that manufactured the 1991
Mercedes-Benz 300CE, certified that vehicle as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
and offered it for sale in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 230CE to the 300CE, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 230CE, as originally
manufactured in the same manner as the 1991 model 300CE that was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable
of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code, losses from passive activities, to the extent that they exceed income
from passive activities, cannot be deducted against nonpassive income. Form 8582 is used to figure the passive activity
loss allowed and the loss to be reported on the tax return. Worksheets 1 and 2 are used to figure the amount to be entered
on lines 1 and 2 of Form 8582, and worksheets 3 through 6 are used to allocate the loss allowed back to individual activities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Beginning on February 28, 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act imposes a 5-day waiting period on the sale,
delivery, or transfer of a handgun in States that do not require a background check. ATF is issuing this notice to inform
Federal firearms licensees of the States that do not currently require a background check, as well as those States
requiring a background check for handgun purchasers. In addition, ATF has compiled a list of chief law enforcement
officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 30, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;159 (107 Stat. 1536) was enacted, amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA),
as amended (18 U.S.C. Chapter 44). Title I of Pub. L. 103&hyph;159, cited as the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act'' (hereafter ``the Act'') provides, in part, for a national waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer,
manufacturer, or dealer may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of the law are effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to apply
on November 30, 1998. The statute also provides alternatives to the waiting period provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 14, 1994, ATF issued temporary regulations implementing the provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;159 (T.D.
ATF&hyph;354, 59 FR 7110). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During February, letters were sent to all Federal firearms licensees advising them as to whether their sales or other
dispositions were subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period or their State background check system. In addition,
licensees in States which are subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period were advised of the designated chief law
enforcement officers in their State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has completed a study of relevant State laws to determine which States are subject to the federal waiting period
provisions and which qualify as ``alternative'' States. Information regarding each category is set out below:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The list of States subject to the Federal 5-day waiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the list of chief law enforcement officers for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, and the list of States not subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal 5-day waiting period, are based on available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. These lists are subject to change because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of possible amendments to State laws and changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designations of chief law enforcement officers which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur either before or after publication of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, ATF recommends that Federal firearms licensees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other interested persons, maintain contact with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate State and local officials for updated information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these matters. Federal firearms licensees are reminded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if they are notified by a chief law enforcement officer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described herein or by ATF that another law enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is serving as the Brady chief law enforcement officer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they must act in accordance with the actual notice received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as opposed to the information contained in this general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice.
