SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is updating the table of normal cost percentages that Federal agencies pay
to finance the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This regulation is necessary for the table to reflect
the changes in the rates that are effective in October 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1993, OPM published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice changing the normal cost percentages effective in October 1994. Subpart D of Part 841 of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations, contains the methodology that OPM uses to determine the rates that agencies must pay to fund the cost
of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the procedures that OPM must follow to change the rates. Under
those procedures, OPM must publish a notice of changes in the rates at least 3 months before the beginning of the fiscal
year in which the new rates become effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 841 contains a table of the normal cost percentages. This table has no regulatory effect.
It merely provides information about the rates. This final rule amends that table to reflect the rates that will become
effective in October 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of proposed rulemaking. Notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this final rule merely provides information
and has no regulatory effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 16, 1994, OPM published (59 FR 12143) a final rule concerning payment of survivor deposits by actuarial reduction.
(FR Doc. 94&hyph;6046) This document adopted OPM's interim rule on that subject as final rules. In two places, reference
to the page number for the interim rule was stated incorrectly. In both places, the incorrect reference to 58 FR 56877
is corrected to 58 FR 52877.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation only provides information about the rate of payment by Federal agencies to OPM for the normal
cost of their employees' FERS benefits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 928 [7 CFR Part 928] regulating the handling
of papayas grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas
grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these
handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule suspends for an indefinite period the minimum grade and the inspection requirements in effect under the
order. This action was recommended by the Papaya Administrative Committee (committee) on April 22, 1994, by a vote
of 8 in favor, 2 opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis
for papayas regulated under the order. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well
as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules
and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 928.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations
for fresh shipments of papayas. Section 928.53 allows for the modification, suspension or termination of such regulations
when warranted. Section 928.55 provides that whenever papayas are regulated pursuant to &sect;928.52 or &sect;928.53,
such papayas must be inspected by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service and certified as meeting the applicable
requirements of such regulation. The cost of inspection and certification is borne by handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 928.313 of the rules and regulations currently in effect under the order establishes minimum grade requirements
for fresh shipments of Hawaiian papayas. This rule suspends &sect;928.313, which requires that such papayas grade
at least Hawaii No. 1, except that not more than 5 percent of the fruit may be immature, and that the weight requirements
specified in the Hawaiian grade standards do not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current minimum grade requirement has been in effect since 1984. The objective of this requirement was to provide
that only acceptable quality fruit enter fresh market channels, thereby ensuring consumer satisfaction, increasing
sales, and improving returns to papaya producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the industry continues to believe that quality is an important factor in maintaining sales, the committee recommended
this suspension because it believes the cost of inspection and certification (mandated when the grade regulations
are in effect) exceeds the benefits derived. The cost of papaya inspections on a per pound basis averages about $.006,
which is nearly as much as the assessment rate established under the order to cover the order's administrative and
promotion costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee members supporting the suspension stated that such action would be in the best interests of producers,
because eliminating the cost of inspection will increase producer returns. Those members contend that the marketplace
will dictate fruit quality, and competition among shippers will ensure shipments of good quality fruit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the industry is pursuing alternative means of improving and ensuring quality, such as providing financial
incentives to producers to deliver good quality fruit to handlers. Current industry practice is for producers to
deliver their fruit to handlers for grading, packing and marketing. Producers are paid by handlers based, in part,
on the quality of fruit they deliver. Producer prices are reduced to reflect the amount of fruit that is discarded during
handling because it is of unacceptable quality. All producers delivering fruit to a particular handler are typically
paid the same amount for their fruit, based on the average quality delivered by all producers. This practice causes
producers delivering high quality fruit to be penalized by producers delivering poorer quality fruit. A newly formed
producers' bargaining cooperative is attempting to change this practice by having low quality fruit attributed
to individual producers. That is, an individual producer would be paid based upon the quality of fruit that individual
delivered to the handler. Thus, producers would have a financial incentive to harvest and deliver high quality product.
This should help improve and maintain the quality of papayas entering the fresh market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee members opposed to the suspension stated that it would allow poor quality fruit on the market and have a negative
impact on the market. Additionally, those members believe that such a suspension will be perceived negatively by
the State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture. They are also concerned about the length of time necessary to reinstate
the grade requirements, if it is determined that such action is needed in the future to ensure that only fruit of acceptable
quality is shipped to fresh markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of committee members acknowledge the possibility that fruit quality could decline as a result of this
action, but do not believe that this is likely. They believe that the reduction in handling costs due to elimination
of mandatory inspection will outweigh any declines in returns attributable to reduced quality. Further, the committee
will monitor the impact this action has on the market, and will recommend reinstatement of quality standards if warranted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule suspends grade and inspection requirements in effect for fresh papayas. Such suspension will enable handlers
to ship papayas to the fresh market at a reduced cost, since handlers will no longer be required to have their fruit inspected
and pay the resulting inspection costs. Suspending grade requirements for fresh papayas is expected to increase
producer returns by reducing costs and maintaining the quality of fruit offered for sale. The industry is committed
to instituting alternative means of quality assurance by providing incentives to producers to harvest and deliver
only acceptable quality fruit. This activity should ensure that consumers continue to receive good quality fresh
papayas. This rule is in the best interest of producers, handlers and consumers, and is expected to increase returns
to papaya producers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's view is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers, since it will permit
the industry to ship fruit without paying the cost of inspection, thus improving producers' returns, and is not expected
to adversely impact the quality of fruit entering fresh markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the suspension of &sect;928.313, this rule also suspends &sect;&sect;928.150 and 928.152 of the
rules and regulations in effect under the order. Section 928.150 provides a means for handlers to receive waivers
from the mandatory inspection requirement under certain circumstances, and &sect;928.152 authorizes exemptions
from the current grade requirement relating to fruit maturity. Since this action suspends mandatory inspection
and grade requirements, these rules authorizing exemptions from such requirements would no longer be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is also made in &sect;928.160, which requires handlers to file monthly utilization reports with
the committee. Among the information required to be submitted are the inspection certificate numbers applicable
to each fresh shipment of papayas. Since inspection will no longer be mandatory, the requirement that handlers submit
inspection certificate numbers would no longer be needed. Thus, &sect;928.160 is revised to suspend such requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0102.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule should reduce the reporting burden on approximately 5 papaya handlers who have been completing PAC Form
7, Application to be an Approved Handler of Immature Papayas, and PAC Form 7(c), Immature Papaya Order Form. Form 7
is estimated to take 15 minutes to complete, and Form 7(c) about 10 minutes per form. No reduction in reporting burden
is expected as a result of the revision in &sect;928.160 pertaining to monthly utilization reports. While handlers
will no longer be required to provide inspection certificate numbers, the remaining information on the reports will
continue to be collected. It is estimated that each report requires 1 hour to complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the suspension of these sections, as set forth below, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the

 because: (1) This rule suspends grade requirements for papayas grown in Hawaii; (2) Hawaiian papaya handlers are
aware of this suspension, which was recommended by the committee at a public meeting, and they will need no additional
time to comply with this suspension; (3) shipment of the 1994 season Hawaiian papaya crop is currently in progress;
(4) this rule needs to be made effective by July 1, 1994, to be of maximum benefit to the Hawaiian papaya industry; and
(5) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior to any finalization
of this interim final rule.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule amends outgoing inspection regulations under the California olive marketing order to authorize
handlers to use in-plant Quality Assurance Programs (QAPs) in lieu of continuous in-line inspection. This rule also
permits handlers to size whole pitted olives by diameter as an alternative to the current requirement that such olives
be sized by weight prior to pitting. Conforming changes are made to the size requirements for imported whole pitted
olives so that the requirements for domestic and imported olives are applied similarly. The changes in the California
olive requirements are designed to result in more efficient handling operations. The changes in import requirements
are necessary under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Marketing Order No. 932 [7 CFR Part 932], both
as amended, regulating the handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified
commodities, including olives, are subject to grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements under a Federal marketing
order, the same or comparable requirements shall be applied to imports of those commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this interim final rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are 5 handlers of olives regulated under the order, and approximately 1,350 producers in the regulated area.
In addition, there are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the requirements of the olive import regulation.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which include olive handlers and importers,
are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the olive producers and importers
may be classified as small entities. None of the olive handlers may be so classified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Olive Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on
December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising outgoing inspection procedures to permit handlers to establish
a QAP in lieu of maintaining continuous in-line outgoing inspection of processed olives. Outgoing inspection is
the assignment of a final grade to the product after processing is completed, according to the requirements of the
U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) [7 CFR 52.3751 to 52.3764]. The committee also recommended
that handlers be allowed to size whole pitted olives by diameter after pitting, as an alternative to the current requirement
that such olives be sized by weight prior to pitting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;932.52 of the order, and &sect;932.152 of the current regulations, handlers are required to maintain
continuous in-line outgoing inspection for the handling of processed olives. Pursuant to &sect;932.53, such outgoing
inspection is performed by the Processed Products Branch (PPB) of the Department. Continuous in-line outgoing inspection
consists of inspection and grading services in an approved plant whereby one or more PPB inspector(s) are present
at all times the plant is in operation to make in-process checks on the preparation, processing, packing, and warehousing
of all products and to assure compliance with sanitary requirements. However, costs for continuous in-line outgoing
inspection have increased in recent years. Thus, the PPB is prepared to develop QAP inspection procedures which will
provide quality assurance certification for California olive handlers, thereby reducing handlers' inspection
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, most handlers employ their own quality-control personnel. The PPB is prepared to establish QAPs with
individual handlers as provided in the ``Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits
and Vegetables and Related Products'' [7 CFR 52.2]. As established, handlers will be permitted to use a QAP inspection
procedure rather than the currently-mandated continuous in-line outgoing inspection. Under a QAP, the PPB provides
training for the handler's quality-control personnel. The handler's quality-control personnel will be trained
in the same procedures currently used by the PPB inspectors. Once the handler's quality-control personnel are trained
to properly perform the same duties and responsibilities as a PPB inspector, a period of evaluation of the reliability
of the handler's quality control responsibilities begins. This is the reliability evaluation period. At such time
as the handler's quality-control personnel successfully complete the reliability evaluation period, a QAP will
begin operation with oversight provided by the PPB. The PPB inspectors will continue to issue certificates of inspection.
Certificates of inspection will be based on outgoing inspection records maintained by the handler's QAP personnel.
These will be verified through spot-checks and sample regrading by PPB inspectors. A QAP will continue to assure safe,
wholesome, and uniformly high-quality processed products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a QAP, each handler and the PPB will develop an individually written plan tailored to each handler's facility.
A contract between the handler and the PPB will also be developed based upon the terms of the QAP. The contract will be
signed at the beginning of the reliability evaluation. Once a handler's QAP is approved, the handler is notified in
writing and the PPB begins verifying the work of the handler's QAP personnel. Such verification may include reviews
of plant sanitation, quality and non-quality product analyses, procedures and/or techniques, case-stamping,
checkloading, condition of container, or other types of procedures normally performed by the PPB. Inclusion of any
or all of these verification procedures will be determined by the operating characteristics of each handler's facility
or facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event deviations from proper QAP procedures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected by the PPB during the reliability verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, the handler will be informed of the problem and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action required. If corrective action is taken, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the QAP continues in operation. Continued deviations may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in suspension of QAP approval. The suspension may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent or temporary and may only be restored upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrence by the PPB. During any suspension, the handler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to use continuous in-line inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishing a QAP inspection procedure meets marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order inspection requirements, and provides handlers with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to continuous in-line inspection (which requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of a PPB inspector during final processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the packaging of olives). To effectuate this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of &sect;932.152, Outgoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, are revised to add authority for handlers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use either the QAP process or continuous in-line inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 932.52 authorizes sizing of whole pitted olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon count-per-pound designations (the actual weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of individual fruit) or modifications recommended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee and approved by the Secretary. Section 932.152 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently specifies that all processed olives must be sized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the count-per-pound designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for canned whole ripe olives, and further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that such sizing be done prior to pitting. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim final rule provides an alternative method for sizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole pitted olives to provide handlers with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in their operations while ensuring that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate size standards are continued for whole pitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standards provide a method for sizing whole pitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fruit on the basis of illustrations and approximate diameter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges (section 52.3754, Table I). For example, olives that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ``Jumbo'' in size are those that are approximately 22 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 millimeters in diameter and conform closely with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable illustration in Table I. The committee believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this sizing method may be more appropriate for whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitted olives, which now account for a substantial majority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the California olives packaged in the whole form. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule authorizes the sizing of whole pitted olives after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitting in accordance with the illustrations and approximate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameter ranges provided in the Standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standards also provide allowances for size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variances for whole pitted olives in &sect;52.3756. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of U.S. Grade C (the minimum allowed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order), provide that of the 60 percent, by count, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives that are most uniform in size, the diameter of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest olive cannot exceed the diameter of the smallest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olive by more than 4 millimeters. These variances will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to whole pitted olives when handlers choose to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their pitted olives sized by diameter, after pitting. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee believes that these guidelines for sizing whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitted olives are sufficient and that no additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications relating to size are needed at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for this change in whole pitted olive sizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, paragraph (f) of &sect;932.152 is revised to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for sizing by diameter as provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;932.152 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised by deleting the sentence which requires sizing prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pitting. Also, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the elimination of the in-line inspection and sizing prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pitting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outgoing regulations contain a table pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size certification of limited size olives for limited use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
styles at &sect;932.152(g)(1). In 1991, the committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended and the Secretary approved modifications in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes of limited use olives. While such modifications were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected elsewhere in the regulations, a conforming change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not made in Table II of &sect;932.152(g)(1). This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrects the table, bringing it into conformance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules as they were modified in 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported into the United States are subject to comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size requirements as established for domestically grown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives under the order. Those requirements are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Olive Regulation 1 [7 CFR 944.401]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the import regulation, canned pitted ripe olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to minimum size requirements in terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum diameter and a specific tolerance for undersized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fruit. The undersize tolerances set forth in the import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation are based upon those established for canned whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives under the California olive marketing order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously explained, this interim final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes size requirements for canned pitted olives under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the order in terms of illustrations, approximate diameter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges, and size variances which are set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards. Thus, in accordance with section 8e of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conforming changes are made in the minimum size requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for imported canned pitted olives so that such requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are applied in a manner similar to that under the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including information and recommendations submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee and other available information, it is hereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 948 and 953 for
the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Colorado Potato Administrative Committee,
Northern Colorado Office (Area III) and the Southeastern Potato Committee (Committees) to incur expenses that are
reasonable and necessary to administer the programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments
on handlers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 97 and Order No. 948, both as amended (7 CFR part 948), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Colorado; and Marketing Agreement No. 104 and Order No. 953, both as amended
(7 CFR part 953), regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Southeastern States (Virginia and North Carolina).
The marketing agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Irish potatoes grown in Colorado and Virginia and North Carolina are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable Irish potatoes handled during the
1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, which began June 1, 1994, and ends May 31, 1995, for Southeastern potatoes and began July
1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995, for Colorado potatoes. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 85 producers of Colorado Area III potatoes under the marketing order and approximately 15
handlers. Also, there are approximately 150 producers of Southeastern potatoes under the marketing order and approximately
60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may
be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budgets of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period were prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible
for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of
these Committees are producers and handlers of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. They are
familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly
affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input into these processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee expenses by expected respective
shipments of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. Because these rates will be applied to actual
shipments of potatoes, the assessment rates must be established at levels that will provide sufficient income to
pay the Committees' expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Colorado Potato Administrative Committee, Northern Colorado Office (Area III) met on April 14, 1994, and unanimously
recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $24,325, $7,474 more than the previous year. Increases in the Federal portion
of the administrative budget include $200 for Committee meetings, $450 for Committee mileage, $50 for insurance
and bond, $2,860 for the manager's salary, $620 for medical insurance, $1,750 for office equipment, $500 for office
supplies, $219 for payroll taxes, $200 for telephone, $250 for miscellaneous, $125 for manager's expense, and $250
for Federal meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major expense item is $11,500 for the manager's salary. The actual salary will be $10,781.50, based on nine months
full-time work and three months at three-quarter time. An additional $718.50 was budgeted to have available and will
only be spent if the workload necessitates full-time work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.02 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated potato shipments of 1,476,750 hundredweight, will yield $29,535 in assessment
income, which is adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal
period, estimated at $31,113, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Colorado, both a State and a Federal marketing order operate simultaneously. The State order authorizes promotion,
including paid advertising, which the Federal order does not. All expenses in this category are financed under the
State order. The jointly operated programs consume about equal administrative time and the two orders continue to
split administrative costs equally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Southeastern Potato Committee met April 20, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $11,000,
the same as last year. Major expense items include $6,800 for Committee staff salaries and $900 for travel expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also recommended an assessment rate of $0.0075 per hundredweight, $0.0025 less than last season's
rate. When the Committee met, planting for the 1994&hyph;95 crop season had not been completed. However, the manager
estimated shipments would generate about $7,000 in assessment income. This, along with funds from the Committee's
$15,000 reserve, will be adequate to cover the expenses incurred. Funds remaining at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal
period should be about the maximum permitted by the order of approximately one fiscal period's expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interim final rules were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994, for 7 CFR part 948 (59 FR 27223) and 7 CFR part 953 (59 FR 27222). Those rules added &sect;948.211 and &sect;953.251
which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committees. Those rules provided that interested
persons could file comments through June 27, 1994. No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely
to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal periods for the programs began on June 1, 1994, for Southeastern potatoes and July
1, 1994, for Colorado Area III potatoes. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods
apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions
which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the

 This action establishes the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95
marketing season at 6,712,910 crates or 100 percent of producers' base quantities. The 1994&hyph;95 marketing season
covers the period August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This interim final rule is intended to lend stability to the
industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the product. As in past marketing seasons,
the limitation on the quantity of Florida celery handled for fresh shipment is not expected to restrict the quantity
of Florida celery actually produced or shipped to fresh markets, because production and shipments are anticipated
to be less than the marketable quantity. This action was unanimously recommended by the Florida Celery Committee
(Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule establishes the quantity
of Florida celery (at 6,712,910 crates or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent of producers' base quantities) which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing
season which covers the period August 1, 1994, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately seven producers of celery in the production area and seven handlers of celery grown in Florida
subject to regulation under the celery marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small
Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural
service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of celery producers
and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is based upon a recommendation and information submitted by the Committee and upon other available information.
The Committee met on June 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a marketable quantity of 6,712,910 crates of fresh
celery for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season beginning August 1, 1994. Additionally, a uniform percentage of 100
percent was recommended which will allow each producer, registered pursuant to section 967.37(f) of the order, to
market 100 percent of such producer's base quantity. These recommendations were based on an appraisal of expected
1994&hyph;95 supply and demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by section 967.37(d)(1) of the order, a reserve of 6 percent (402,775 crates) of the 1993&hyph;94 total
base quantities was made available to new producers and for increases for existing producers. The deadline for requesting
changes in base quantities was May 1, 1994. No applications for additional base quantities were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule will limit the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may purchase from producers and ship
to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season to 6,712,910 crates. This marketable quantity is the same
as the 1993&hyph;94 marketable quantity, and is more than the average number of crates marketed fresh during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1987&hyph;88 through 1992&hyph;93 seasons. It is expected that such quantity will be more than actual shipments
for the 1994&hyph;95 season. Thus, the 6,712,910 crate marketable quantity is not expected to restrict the amount
of Florida celery which growers produce or the amount of celery which handlers ship. For these reasons, the interim
final rule should lend stability to the industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impractical, unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action was recommended at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to express
their views and provide input; (2) it is desirable to have this action in place as soon as possible because celery planting
begins in July and the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is August 1, 1994; and (3) this rule provides a 30-day
comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule which revised the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order
for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The interim final rule reapportioned the representation established
for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee),
to provide more equitable representation. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee, which
is responsible for local administration of the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating the handling
of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have any retroactive effect. This action will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This rule finalizes an interim final rule which revised Section 989.126 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations
[7 CFR 989.102&hyph;989.176] and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994, [59 FR 27225], reapportioned the Committee representation established for independent and small
cooperative marketing association handlers on the Committee. The interim rule provided for broader independent
handler/small cooperative handler representation on the Committee to reflect the different handler segments in
the raisin industry. The change did not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on
handlers or producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 989.26 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 47 members, of whom 35 shall represent producers,
10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association, and 1 shall be a public member.
The 10 handler positions are allocated between: (1) Cooperative marketing associations, each of which acquired
not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year (referred to as major cooperative
handlers); and (2) independent handlers and small cooperative marketing associations; i.e., those who acquired
less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Currently, there is one cooperative
in group (1) engaged in handling raisins. That handler is allocated three positions on the Committee. Group (2) handlers
are allocated seven positions. The allocation of members between the two handler groups is based on the provisions
specified in paragraph (d) of &sect;989.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations had previously provided for independent and small
cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Two members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this final rule, category (1) is referred to as the ``large-sized handler'' group, category (2)
is referred to as the ``medium-sized handler'' group, and category (3) is referred to as the ``all other handler''
group. The number of handlers in the ``all other handler'' group has decreased from 10 to 7 since the 1990&hyph;91 crop
year. In addition, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, the ``medium-sized handler'' group acquired more than four
times the tonnage acquired by the ``all other handler'' group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this information, the Committee met on March 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended to move one handler position
from the ``all other handler'' group to the ``medium-sized handler'' group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule amended &sect;989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations by changing the independent
and small cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Three members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous and current independent handler/small cooperative handler representation are shown as follows:

The shift in membership recognized the relative importance of the ``large-sized handler,'' ``medium-sized handler,''
and ``all other handler groups,'' and provides an opportunity for the ten largest independent/small cooperative
handlers to be represented on the Committee either as a member or as an alternate member. The ``all other handler''
group is eligible to nominate two members and two alternate members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 27, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published
in the

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes a separate brown rot tolerance for dried prunes produced in California and for dried prunes
imported into the United States. This rule specifies a separate tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot affected prunes,
within the combined tolerance allowance of 5 percent. The separate tolerance should benefit producers, handlers,
and consumers, and foster continued growth of the market for dried prunes. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation
of the Prune Marketing Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the order. As provided
under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, a corresponding change is being made in the prune
import regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 993 [7 CFR Part 993], both as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order'', regulating the handling of dried prunes produced in California. The marketing agreement
and order are authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule, which also amends the prune import regulation (section 999.200), is also issued pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 8e of the Act. Section 8e provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including prunes, are regulated
under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality,
and maturity requirements as those in effect for the domestically produced commodity. Marketing order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 993, as amended [7 CFR Part 993] prescribes grade and size requirements for dried prunes produced in California.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. Thus, they
also have small entity orientation, and impact both small and large business entities in a manner comparable to rules
issued under such marketing orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of dried prunes produced in California subject to regulation under the marketing
order, and approximately 1,360 producers in the regulated area. In addition, at least two importers of dried prunes
are subject to import regulations and will be affected by this action. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of handlers
and producers of California dried prunes may be classified as small entities. The majority of the importers of dried
prunes may also be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule revises &sect;993.601 of Subpart_Grade Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee
and other available information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;993.49 of the marketing order provide the Secretary the authority to modify the minimum
standards for natural condition prunes received from producers and dehydrators (inbound inspection). Likewise,
paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;993.50 provide the Secretary authority for the modification of the minimum standards
for prunes that are shipped or otherwise disposed of by a handler (outbound inspection). Whenever a regulation is
established that increases grade requirements, it normally applies to both natural condition (unprocessed) prunes
and processed (cleaned or treated with water or steam) prunes. Minimum grade standards are specified under &sect;993.97
and have been modified in the rules and regulations under &sect;&sect;993.149 and 993.150.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current procedures for handling and scoring (inspecting) prunes, clusters of brown rot affected prunes are
removed from inbound samples during the initial grading process and are not scored against the lot. However, single
prunes affected with brown rot are often not removed during initial grading and are subsequently scored as defective
during inspection. For both incoming and outgoing prune inspections, the combined defect allowance, which includes
mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay, cannot exceed 5 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There has been a high incidence of brown rot infection in the 1992 and 1993 California prune crops. Brown rot is caused
by two closely related fungi in the blossoms and fruit of prunes and other stone fruits. Success of treatment varies,
making control of brown rot very difficult. Previously infected orchards are more susceptible to re-infection,
and, thus, a reoccurrence of brown rot in the 1994 prune crop is expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Harvested prunes affected by brown rot cannot be marketed as prunes and, thus, have no value to handlers, since even
blending them with good prunes for the manufacture of prune products, such as prune juice and concentrate, yields
an unacceptable flavor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the expected high incidence of prunes affected by brown rot in the 1994 crop, the Committee met on December
8, 1993, and unanimously recommended establishing a separate defect tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot to be included
in the current 5 percent combined defects tolerance for mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay. Finally,
the Committee recommended that the new tolerance be applied to both inbound and outbound inspections. This rule will
have the effect of lowering the brown rot tolerance from the current maximum of 5 percent (assuming no other defects)
to a maximum of 3 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee believes the addition of specific brown rot tolerances will encourage growers to improve their cultural
practices to reduce the incidence of brown rot in their 1994 crops. In addition, notification of the new requirements
early in the growing season would provide growers with sufficient time to implement cultural practices that should
reduce the incidence of brown rot in their prunes. The California prune industry will benefit through increased sales,
which is expected to improve growers' returns. Handlers will benefit by paying for fewer prunes that have no value
and by lowering their sorting costs. Finally, this rule will result in a consistently higher quality product being
shipped, which will benefit consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tolerance also applies to imported prunes. Section 8e of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality
or maturity requirements are in effect for dried prunes under a domestic marketing order, imported dried prunes must
meet the same or comparable requirements. Because this final rule establishes an additional tolerance for dried
prunes under the domestic handling regulation, a corresponding change to the import prune regulation [7 CFR part
999.200] is also included in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee recommended that this rule become effective by early July 1994, to ensure that implementation be in
place by the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which begins August 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 18, 1994, [59 FR 25841]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until June 17, 1994.
No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 crop year begins August
1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many of the 1994&hyph;95 season prunes as possible;
and (3) the proposed rule provided a 30-day comment period and no comments were received.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is establishing a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for television receiving
sets and compact disc players. The basis for a waiver for these classes of products is that there are no small business
manufacturers or processors available to supply them to the Federal Government. The effect of these waivers is to
allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract
set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for television receiving sets or compact disc
players.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 100&hyph;656, enacted on November 15, 1988, incorporated into the Small Business Act the previously existing
regulation that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or the SBA 8(a) Program must provide
the products of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer
or processor. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. The SBA regulations which implement
this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II),
provides for waiver of this requirement by SBA for any ``class of products'' for which there are no small business manufacturers
or processors available to participate in the Federal procurement market. To be considered available to participate
in the Federal procurement market on these classes of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted
a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal Government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines ``class of products'' based on two coding systems. The first is the Office of Management and Budget
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, and the second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal
Procurement Data System.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBA was originally asked to process 15 class waivers of these Nonmanufacturer Rule, and sources were found for
all but these remaining two classes: (1) Television receiving sets and (2) compact disc players.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding television receiving sets, the SBA sought small business sources by contacting the General Services Administration's
Federal Supply Service in Fort Worth, Texas. The SBA also researched its Procurement Automated Source System (PASS)
and the Thomas Register. In addition, SBA published a notice seeking potential sources in the May 6, 1994, Commerce
Business Daily and an intent to grant a class waiver in the April 22, 1994,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 59 FR 19150. After a 15-day comment period, two comments were received received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both comments regarded the existence of a small business manufacturer of health care televisions. These televisions
are wall- or ceiling-mounted and are normally used in hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis facilities. Although
health care televisions may be purchased and used by individuals in their homes, these televisions are not normally
used in households for home entertainment. Two marketing firms for these televisions confirmed that these televisions
are not considered household items and are not marketed to individuals for home entertainment. After reviewing the
marketing information for health care televisions, it has become apparent that they are in a different category from
household television receiving sets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the absence of small business manufacturers, SBA is establishing a class waiver for television receiving
sets (SIC code 3651, PSC code 7730) pursuant to Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(ii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II).
The effect of this class waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic
manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for household
television receiving. This waiver will be in effect indefinitely, but is subject to review by SBA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding compact disc players, the SBA sought small business sources by contacting the General Services Administration's
Federal Supply Service in Fort Worth, Texas. The SBA also researched the PASS and the Thomas Register. In addition,
SBA published a notice seeking potential sources in the May 9, 1994, Commerce Business Daily and an intent to grant
a class waiver in the April 22, 1994,

Based on the absence of small business manufacturers, SBA is establishing a class waiver for compact disc players
(SIC code 3651, PSC code 7730) pursuant to the statutory authority cited above. The effect of this class waiver is to
allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract
set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for compact disc players. This waiver will be
in effect indefinitely, but is subject to review by SBA.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is establishing a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for office copiers.
The basis for a waiver for office copiers is that there are no small business manufacturers or processors available
to supply them to the Federal Government. The effect of this waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers
to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded
through the SBA 8(a) Program for office copiers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBA was originally asked to process a request for a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for copiers. After
discussions with the General Services Administration's Office of Scientific Equipment Commodity Center, this
was modified to be copiers/duplicating equipment. The SBA then searched the Procurement Automated Source System
(PASS) and Thomas Register and published a notice seeking potential sources in the Commerce Business Daily. In addition,
SBA published a notice of intent to grant a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule in the March 15, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 59 FR 11938 (1994). After a 15-day comment period, two comments were received. Both comments regarded the existence
of a small business manufacturer of duplicators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment from a Federal agency informed SBA of the existence of a small business which manufactures office duplicators.
The second comment was from a small business manufacturer of spirit duplicators and stencil/mimeograph duplicators,
which they routinely provide to the Federal Government. Their duplicators use liquid ink and spirit fluid to produce
duplicates, and when compared with office copiers, their duplicators are slow and labor intensive. Due to their speed
and labor intensive nature, these duplicators tend to be marketed primarily to churches and schools, and are intended
for relatively low volume work. The firm's marketing representative informed SBA that these duplicators are not
in direct competition with office copiers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the marketing information for these duplicators, it became apparent that these products are in a
different category than office copiers. For these reasons, the class of products which is being waived from the Nonmanufacturer
Rule is more narrowly defined to include only office copiers. All types of duplicating equipment are excluded from
this class waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above information, SBA is establishing a waiver for office copiers (SIC code 3579, PSC code 3610) pursuant
to Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II). The effect of this class
waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal
contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for office copiers. This waiver will
be in effect indefinitely, but is subject to periodic review by the SBA.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The first purpose of this document is to announce that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is terminating the
waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass; and (2) Structural shapes, angles, channels, tees and
zees, aluminum and high nickel alloy. The decision to terminate these waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule is based
on evidence provided to the SBA that there is a small business which manufactures items within these classes of products.
This small business is available to provide items within each class to the Federal government. Terminating these
waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small or 8(a) businesses to provide the products of domestic
small business manufacturers or processors where these classes of products are required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The second purpose of this document is to announce that SBA is retaining class waivers for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel
alloy; (2) plate sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy; (3) wire, nonelectrical, high nickel
alloy; (4) plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper-nickel, and copper; and (5)
sheet and plate aluminum products. The effect of retaining these class waivers is that small businesses which receive
either small business set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for these products awards may provide the products
of any domestic manufacturer or processor.

Section 210 of Public Law 101&hyph;574 further amended the Small Business Act to allow for waivers for classes of products

Decision to terminate two class waivers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. SBA announced its decision to grant a class waiver for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper,
nickel-copper-aluminum, copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. Recently, the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) Defense Industrial Supply Center (DISC)
brought to SBA's attention the existence of a small business manufacturer for items within this class of products.
Based on this information, a notice of the Agency's intent to terminate this waiver and waivers for six other classes
of products was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360. The notice allowed thirty days for a comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received from the small businesses and DLA were similar to each other. They agreed that a small business
exists which manufactures items in this class of products. However, they believed they may not be able to supply all
of their potential procurement requirements with items manufactured by the small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the SBA's published regulations, 58 FR 48954 (1993), ``(u)pon receipt by the SBA of evidence that a small
business manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market for a waived class of products, the waiver shall be
terminated by the Associate Administrator for (Government Contracting).'' Based on this regulation, the SBA is
required to terminate the class waiver for this class of products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the waiver previously granted for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass (Product and Service Code (PSC) 9530, Standard Industrial
Classification Code (SIC) 3356) is terminated, effective ninety days from the date of this notice. Small business
set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for this class of products may rely on this waiver where the solicitation is
dated before the ninetieth day after the date of the

The SBA originally announced its decision to grant class waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for these five classes
of products in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. While researching SBA's Procurement Automated Source System (PASS) on a related issue,
SBA became aware of the possible existence of small business manufacturers for items within each of these classes
of products. After the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement on January 10, 1994, of an intent to terminate these classes of products, the SBA received comments from
several small businesses and DLA regarding this matter. All parties urged that SBA not terminate waivers for these
five classes of products on the basis that doing so would adversely affect both the Federal procurement process for
these items and the existing suppliers for those products. Also, we learned that the production capabilities of the
small business manufacturers of these products is severely limited in quantity and product type. Based on these comments,
the SBA will retain the class waivers for these classes of products.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 1, 1994, SBA promulgated a final rule amending the size standard in 13 CFR 121.802 for its Surety Bond Guaranty
Program (59 FR 28231). The amended regulatory text was designated a paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;121.802. However,
in a previous amendment of &sect;121.802, which contains size standards for SBA financial assistance, SBA had promulgated
a new size standard for Small Business Investment Company assistance by dividing the text of paragraph (a)(2) into
two separate paragraphs, paragraph (a)(2) for development company assistance and paragraph (a)(3) for SBIC assistance,
and redesignating paragraph (a)(3), containing the size standard for surety bond guaranty assistance, as paragraph
(a)(4). When promulgating its final rule amending the surety bond guaranty size standard, however, SBA inadvertently
identified the amended regulatory text as paragraph (a)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 series airplanes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action requires an inspection to verify that the cables supplying power to the aileron trim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are adequately protected and to detect any damage to these cables. This amendment also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires installation of protective sleeves on unprotected cables, and replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damaged cables. This amendment is prompted by reports of a short circuit of these cables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to worn protective sleeves. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron trim, which could lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of aileron trim control.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. The DGAC advises that the cables that supply power to the aileron trim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-circuited on an in-service airplane. Investigation revealed that the protective sleeve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these cables was worn. Short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trim, if not corrected, could result in loss of aileron trim control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0070, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 20, 1993, which describes procedures for visually inspecting to verify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective sleeve on the cables that supply power to the aileron trim adequately protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cables, and to detect damaged cables. This service bulletin also contains instructions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing damaged cables with cables that have been modified in accordance with Avions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0014, Revision 2, dated December 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. This latter service bulletin describes procedures for installation of protective sleeves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Modification A0014) on cables that are not adequately protected. The DGAC classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;004&hyph;054(B), dated
January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to prevent loss of aileron trim control due to a short circuit in the cables that supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power to the aileron trim. This AD requires visually inspecting to verify that the cables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that supply power to the aileron trim are adequately protected, and to detect damaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cables; replacing damaged cables with cables that have been previously modified; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing protective sleeves on unprotected cables. The actions are required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD applies only to airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 072. For airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 073 and subsequent, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glass fabric adhesive tape has been applied to the cables prior to delivery of the airplane; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, these airplanes are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;99&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is amending Appendix A of CFTC rule 1.55(c)
adopted by the Commission on June 28, 1994, to identify the United Kingdom and Ireland as additional jurisdictions
whose relevant regulatory authorities have adopted the generic risk disclosure statement for specified products.
This order is issued pursuant to the Commission's recent rulemaking amending, among other provisions, CFTC rule
1.55(c), 59 FR 34376 (July 5, 1994), to permit registrants to deliver to customers a two-page generic risk disclosure
statement that may be used to satisfy the CFTC's risk disclosure requirements applicable to domestic and foreign
commodity futures and commodity options, and which also is intended to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements
of certain foreign jurisdictions. The Commission noted that it would on a periodic basis, update the listing of those
jurisdictions that accept the generic risk disclosure document as meeting specified disclosure requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 28, 1994 the Commission amended rules 1.55(c), 33.7(a) and 190.10(c) to permit registrants to deliver to customers
a generic risk disclosure statement contained in new Appendix A of CFTC rule 1.55(c), which satisfies risk disclosure
statement requirements contained in CFTC rules 1.55(b), 33.7(b) and 190.10(c) as well as the special disclosure
requirement related to futures-style margining of the options premium permitted on certain foreign exchanges.
As the generic statement was developed in cooperation with various international regulators and is intended to satisfy
the risk disclosure requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions who have implemented the language of this risk
disclosure statement in their jurisdictions in accordance with their domestic law, Appendix A specifies those jurisdictions
that permit the use of the generic risk disclosure statement and the products for which the statement may be used. The
CFTC noted that it would amend Appendix A on a periodic basis to provide updated information in this regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the generic risk disclosure statement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the United Kingdom Securities and Futures Authority (``SFA'') and the Central Bank of Ireland (``CBI'') on July
11, 1994 confirmed the conclusion of applicable national procedures to permit the statement to be used to satisfy
relevant risk disclosure obligations within their jurisdictions. The generic risk disclosure statement addresses,
in the case of members of the United Kingdom SFA, commodity futures, options on commodity futures, options on commodities
and options on securities, and in the case of members of exchanges whose rules have been approved by the CBI, financial
futures and options on financial futures. Accordingly, the CFTC is amending Appendix A to reflect the addition of
the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland as jurisdictions in which the generic risk disclosure statement may be
used to satisfy relevant risk disclosure requirements for the products specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission is clarifying the entry for the United States in Appendix A to conform the text in the entry
to the text of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380, has informed FDA that it has transferred
ownership of, and all rights and interests in, approved NADA 065&hyph;488 to Walco International, Inc., 15 West Putnam,
Porterville, CA 93257. In addition, Walco has not previously been listed in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) as a sponsor of an
approved NADA. That section is amended to add entries for the firm. Furthermore, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 8, 1991, FDA published a document to reflect a change of sponsor from Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler
code 000029) to SmithKline Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler code 053571). The current 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1)
and (b)(2) does not reflect that change. This document removes the entry for Beecham in 21 CFR 522.1696a(b) and adds
in its place the entry for Walco International, Inc., the new sponsor. Accordingly, the agency is amending the regulations
in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) and (c)(2) and 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1) and (b)(2) to reflect those changes.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations regarding the place for filing a notice of tax lien against personal property.
Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA), amended section 6323
of the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a state conforming to or reenacting a federal law establishing a national
filing system is not considered to have designated a second office for filing a notice of tax lien. TAMRA also amended
section 6323 to provide that the filing of a notice of federal tax lien is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code
and is not subject to any other federal law that establishes a national filing system.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations amend the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 6323
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations reflect the amendment of section 6323 by sections 1015(s)(1)
(A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3573) (TAMRA).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1993, (58 FR 21550) providing proposed rules under section 6323 of the Code. No public comments were received
and accordingly, the final regulations are substantially identical to the proposed regulations. Certain minor
stylistic changes have been made.

Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of TAMRA amended section 6323(f) of the Code by clarifying that a state's conformance
to or reenactment of a federal law establishing a national filing system for personal property does not constitute
a second office for filing in that state. The existing regulations provide that if a state has designated more than
one office for filing liens, the IRS must file the notice of tax lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States
district court. TAMRA also clarified that the filing of notices of liens by the IRS is to be governed solely by the Code
and is not subject to any other federal law establishing a national filing system.

, 56 B.R. 732 (S.D. Fla. 1985). In that case, the IRS filed its Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the clerk of the county circuit
court, but the court held that under section 6323(f)(1) the IRS was instead required to file its Notice of Federal Tax
Lien in the office of the clerk of the United States district court. The court found that the State of Florida had designated
not one, but two offices for the filing of Federal tax liens against personal property: The office of the clerk of the
circuit court of the county in which the personal property was located and, because the state had adopted the U.S. government's
national filing system for civil aircraft, the F.A.A.'s offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The final regulations
revise &sect;301.6323(f)&hyph;1 by providing that state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing
a national filing system does not constitute a second office for filing; by providing that the filing of liens is not
subject to federal laws (other than the Code) establishing a national filing system for liens; and by adding two examples,
one of which resembles the fact pattern of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

A state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a designation
by state law of an office for filing liens against personal property. Thus, if state law provides that a notice of lien
affecting personal property must be filed in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides
and also adopts a federal law that requires a notice of lien to be filed in another location in order to attach to a specific
type of property, the state is considered to have designated only one office for the filing of the notice of lien, and
to protect its lien the Internal Revenue Service need only file its notice in the office of the county clerk for the county
in which the taxpayer resides.

(c) National filing system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The filing of federal tax liens is to be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal
law that may establish a national system for filing liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property.
Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Agency for filing
liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Example 5.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The law of State F provides that notices of lien affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the circuit
court in the county in which the personal property is located. State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide
that all instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the United States must be recorded in the
Office of the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax lien arises against
ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is located but does not file the notice with the
FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute a second place of filing
pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax lien is validly filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 6.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assume the same facts as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that State F did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result is the same because the filing
of federal tax liens is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national filing
system.

This document clarifies the Final Rule published May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23637), regarding the redelegation of certain
functions and authority which were vested in the Attorney General by the Controlled Substances Act and subsequently
delegated to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In that Final Rule, the Administrator redelegated
to the Deputy Administrator the authority to exercise all necessary functions under 21 CFR Part 1300 which have not
already been redelegated in subpart R of 28 CFR 0.104. This notice will serve to clarify that all functions under 21
CFR Parts 1300&hyph;1316 were delegated to the Deputy Administrator by the Final Rule published May 6, 1994.

OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the
Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment consists of
revisions to Indiana's Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Statutes concerning an exemption for operations conducted
under IC 13&hyph;4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), Division of Water. The amendment is intended to consolidate and streamline
Indiana's permit system by implementing statutory changes contained in the 1993 Senate Enrolled ACT (SEA) 179.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 1, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1325), the IDNR submitted a proposed amendment
to the Indiana program concerning statutes enacted by Indiana under SEA 179 from the 1993 Indiana Legislative Session.
SEA 179 contains numerous amendments to the Indiana statutes, but only those which pertain to the Indiana program
are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 5, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. On May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27251), OSM
corrected a typographical error in the May 5, 1994, proposed rule announcement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&blank;Permit Approval or Denial
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indiana has amended subsection IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&hyph;3(a) concerning the findings required to be made by
the director of the IDNR prior to issuing a permit. New subdivision 3(a)(10) is added to provide as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) if any part of the operation would take place in a floodway (as defined in IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;3), the operation
will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) result in unreasonably detrimental effects upon the fish, wildlife, or botanical resources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) adversely affect the efficiency; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana explained that the proposed language quoted above is being added to the
Indiana program as a consequence of an amendment to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13. New subdivision 13(e)(3) is added
to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13 to provide that operations conducted under IC 13&hyph;4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) are
exempted from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the IDNR, Division of Water. Instead,
any activity in a floodway which is to be conducted as part of an operation regulated under IC 13&hyph;4.1 must be identified
in the permit application to the Division of Reclamation. A determination must then be made by the Division of Reclamation
that the environmental standards identified in the proposed language are met. This determination will then become
part of the ``Findings Document'' which accompanies each of the Division's final permit recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no direct Federal counterpart in SMCRA or the Federal regulations to the proposed amendment. As explained
by Indiana in its submittal of this amendment, the purpose of this legislative change is to consolidate and streamline
the permit system as well as strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work. Indiana further explained
that any disturbance on a mine site is part of a much larger effort already being reviewed by the Division of Reclamation.
Further, Indiana asserts that this change allows for a more thorough evaluation of the work when taken in context with
the overall plan of operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the proposed amendments are not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. None
of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions
in the Indiana program. On the contrary, all of the approved provisions of the Indiana program remain in full effect.
Further, the proposed provisions are not inconsistent with SMCRA sections 503 concerning State programs, and 505
concerning State laws. Therefore, the Director is approving the amendment.

IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 3 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested
Federal agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented on the amendment (Administrative Record Number
IND&hyph;1378). The FWS stated that if the review of impacts to ``fish, wildlife, and botanical resources'' continues
to be administered by the IDNR's Division of Fish and Wildlife, or other trained fish and wildlife biologists, the
FWS assumes that the level of protection of fish and wildlife resources would not be changed from the current situation.
As discussed above in the Director's Findings, Indiana explained in its submittal that the proposed amendment should
strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work since the review will become part of a much larger effort
already being conducted by the Division of Reclamation. The change, Indiana asserts, will allow for a more thorough
evaluation of the construction on a floodway. In his review of this amendment, the Director has concluded that none
of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions
in the Indiana program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FWS further stated that the FWS does not anticipate any impacts to Federally endangered/threatened species as
a result of the proposed revision. The Director concurs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 23176). The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled
public hearing so no hearing was held. No public comments were received in response to this amendment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the findings above, the Director is approving Indiana's program amendment concerning construction in a
floodway as submitted by Indiana on October 1, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 914 codifying decisions
concerning the Indiana program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective
immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into
conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required
by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving proposed Program Amendment Number 67 to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred
to as the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment was initiated
by Ohio and is intended to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning
postmining land uses. Specifically, the amendment proposes to clearly identify postmining land use categories,
to clarify the comparison of premining and postmining land uses, to clarify that ``undeveloped land'' may be the designated
postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land, to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish
and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses, and to eliminate redundant provisions more stringent
than the Federal regulations for notice and approval of alternative postmining land uses by other reviewing agencies
and for the design of postmining land use plans by an engineer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2017), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 67. In this amendment, Ohio proposed
to revise one rule at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17 to make the Ohio program as effective
as corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. OSM announced receipt of proposed Program
Amendment Number 67 in the May 26, 1994,

on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on June 27, 1994.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Ohio program. Revisions not specifically addressed below concern nonsubstantive
wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting
from this amendment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is revising paragraphs (C) (1) through (11) to clarify the titles of the eleven approved postmining land use categories.
Since these are nonsubstantive changes, the Director finds that the revised State rules are no less effective than
their Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 701.5.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is revising paragraph (B)(1) to clarify that the postmining land use for land that was mined pursuant to a license
issued prior to April 10, 1972, shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible
with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining. The State's
proposed language is consistent with the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817/133(b). The Director,
therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than its Federal counterpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that, if the premining land use was changed within five
years of the beginning of mining, the postmining land use shall be compared to the historic use of the land as well as
its use immediately before mining. There are no Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 816/817.133. However, the State rule
at 1501:13&hyph;4&hyph;04(I)(1)(a) requires information on historical land use in permit applications if the
land use changed within five years before mining. This corresponds to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(1)
and 784.15(a)(1). Since the State rule at OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B) states that ``[t]he premining uses of land
to which the postmining land uses are compared shall be those which the land previously supported *&blank;*&blank;*''
this would include historical land uses if the land use changed within five years before mining. Therefore, the Director
finds that the deletion of former paragraph (B)(2) will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal
regulations.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B)(2), Undeveloped land use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is adding a new requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that land may be returned to the undeveloped postmining land use
category only if the land was categorized as undeveloped prior to mining. Ohio's proposed rule clarifies that undeveloped
land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land. The Director finds
that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(b)
and 30 CFR 701.5.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(C), Undeveloped land use

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is revising paragraph (C) to require that all proposed changes of land use, including changes from undeveloped
land to forestland or fish and wildlife habitat, shall be considered an alternative land use change subject to approval
by the Chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (the Chief). The Director finds
that Ohio's proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is not less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR
816/817.133 and the Federal definition of ``land use'' at 30 CFR 701.5.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(8) that plans to change the postmining land use to undeveloped
land from some other land use category must treat the land as if the postmining land use were in the forestland/fish
and wildlife habitat category. The proposed deletion of this paragraph is consistent with revised paragraphs (B)(2)
and (C) which clarify that undeveloped land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use
is undeveloped land. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed deletion of paragraph (D)(8) will not render
the Ohio rule less effective than the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(9) and (C)(10) to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat''
are distinct postmining land uses. The ``forest'' category includes land used for commercial or noncommercial production
of wood or wood products. The Director finds that the revised rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816/817.133 and the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(1), Agency review of postmining land uses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that requests for alternative postmining land use
must contain a written statement of views from the authorities having statutory responsibilities for land use policies
and plans. Ohio is also deleting the requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that the operator must obtain any required approval
of the final land use from local, State, or Federal land management agencies, including any necessary zoning or other
required changes. The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(c) impose no similar requirements.
Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of these requirements will not render the Ohio program less effective
than the Federal regulations.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(6), Agency review of postmining land uses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land
uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wildlife and on threatened or endangered
plants or animals or their critical habitats and must demonstrate that an opportunity to comment has been provided
in accordance with OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;11 to appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management
agencies. There are no Federal counterparts at 30&hyph;CFR 816/817.133. Therefore, the Director finds that the
revisions do not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(9) that alternative postmining land use plans must demonstrate
that the operator has provided written notice of the proposed land use to appropriate State and Federal agencies with
instructions for those agencies to provide any comments on the proposed land use to the Chief. The Federal requirements
at 30 CFR 816/817.133 do not impose a similar requirement. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this
requirement will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement at paragraph (D)(2) that postmining land use plans must be designed under

requirements at 30 CFR 816/817.133. The Director, therefore, finds that the deletion of paragraph (D)(2) will not

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.

Federal Agency Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, stated that it does not recommend that any forestland
be grazed as indicated in paragraph (C)(3) of OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17. The only change proposed by Ohio at paragraph
(C)(3) was to clarify the title of the approved postmining land use. Therefore, the Director will not address this
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other comments were received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect
to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. OH&hyph;1993). The EPA responded on June 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2030), that it reviewed
the proposed amendment but had no comments.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on May 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of
State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order No. 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Management
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24100), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Texaco Chemical Co., P.O. Box 27707, Houston,
TX 77227-7707, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 2E4191 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant
to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d)
by amending the current exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of diethylene glycol by expanding
its use as an inert ingredient, to read ``deactivator, adjuvant for formulations used before crop emerges from the
soil.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the amended tolerance exemption will
protect the public health. Therefore, the amended tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has adopted rules to implement the provisions of the Telecommunications Authorizations Act of 1992,
which created a new section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act that authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional
gifts, donations and bequests in furtherance of its functions. The Commission has ensured that its rules are consistent
with the directive in section 4(g)(3) to promulgate implementing regulations that ``include provisions to preclude
the acceptance of any gift, bequest or donation that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict
of interest.'' These regulations will promote the performance of the Commission's regulatory functions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. This is a summary of the Report and Order (R&amp;O) in GC Docket 93&hyph;153, adopted June 24, 1994 and released July
22, 1994. The full text of this document is available for inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. in the FCC Dockets Reference Room (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may be purchased from

2. The purpose of this R&amp;O is to implement the conflict of interest restrictions in section 4(g)(3) of the Communications
Act, which authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional gifts, donations and bequests. In order to develop
implementing regulations, the Commission looked for guidance to the policies of other agencies that have statutory
gift acceptance authority, the provisions of the new Office of Government Ethics (OGE) government-wide standards
of employee conduct, and General Services Administration (GSA) regulations implementing agency acceptance of
travel reimbursement. The Commission requested commenters to submit alternative proposals. None of the parties
who filed comments in this proceeding endorsed an absolute ban on the acceptance of gifts from Commission regulatees.
As discussed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), 58 FR 34405 (1994), and as also pointed out by commenters,
we continue to believe that imposing such an absolute ban would exclude a vast number of potential donors, and those
who may be the most likely donors of equipment or other services that would be useful to the Commission in achieving
more efficient performance of its regulatory functions. In addition, as discussed in our NPRM, gifts to agencies
do not necessarily involve the same type or degree of conflicts or appearance concerns as those of personal gifts made
to employees with decisionmaking responsibility_the focus of most traditional conflict of interest regulations,
such as the OGE government-wide standards of employee conduct. In the NPRM, we concluded that, in the context of agency
gift acceptance, more flexible approaches could be used. Commenters agreed with the conclusion reached in our NPRM
that less restrictive policies can be formulated which adequately address conflict of interest concerns. Accordingly,
the Commission has decided to reject an absolute ban on gifts from regulated entities and to construe section 4(g)(3)
in a flexible manner that will better achieve its statutory objective and promote the performance of the Commission's
regulatory functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 4(g)(3), unlike some agency gift acceptance statutes, expressly limits the Commission's gift acceptance
authority to gifts that are ``unconditional.'' This statutory restriction effectively precludes gifts that are
made contingent on official action. To guard against any potential that official action could be influenced by gifts,
we have determined that it is critical to ensure that the section 4(g)(3) prohibition on conditional gifts is carefully
and scrupulously observed. The regulations adopted in this Order contain certain structural safeguards and absolute
prohibitions designed to avoid both conflict of interest concerns and appearance concerns. In addition, the regulations
impose mandatory factors that authorized agency ethics officials must consider in determining whether conflicts
or appearance problems exist. Finally, the regulations contain public disclosure and reporting requirements that
are intended to minimize or eliminate appearance problems. We believe that these mechanisms work together effectively
to eliminate the conflicts of interest and appearance concerns. In order to insulate agency officials with programmatic
responsibilities, insofar as possible, from involvement in determinations regarding gift acceptance or discussions
with potential donors regarding gifts, we are requiring potential donors and Commission employees who receive gift
overtures to refer such matters to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. We also are imposing an absolute
bar on agency solicitation of gifts from regulated entities and others identified as prohibited sources under the
new OGE standards of conduct. We are requiring that all monetary gifts be made by check rather than in cash. Further,
because we think that conflicts of interest and appearance problems may be greatest when the gifts made to the agency
appear to enure more to the personal benefit of employees, we have decided that certain types of gifts should be prohibited
altogether, e.g., food and drink which would continue to be governed by the OGE standards of conduct or other independent
authority.

4. We have also decided not to accept under section 4(g)(3) gifts of travel expenses for attendance at meetings that
are governed by the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 1353, the government-wide travel reimbursement statute.
The GSA rules implementing section 1353 prohibit agencies from using general gift acceptance statutes to accept
travel reimbursement for attendance at meetings that are covered by that section. As we noted in the NPRM, however,
GSA's rules implementing 1353 do not govern the acceptance of travel and related expenses for attendance at, or participation
in, meetings or events that are required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory functions. We agree with
commenters that there are substantial public interest benefits to be gained by employees' attendance at, or participation
in, certain government sponsored meetings or events (such as international coordination meetings provided for
by treaty). Thus, to the extent that attendance at, or participation in, government sponsored meetings or events
are deemed outside the scope of 1353 coverage (because the meetings are required in order to carry out statutory or
regulatory functions) we will permit the acceptance of travel reimbursement for them under section 4(g)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission has established the imposition of mandatory factors that Commission officials must consider in
determining whether conflicts or appearance problems may exist. Where gifts are offered by a regulated entity, we
will require officials making conflict of interest determinations to evaluate at the outset the extent to which benefits
of the gift might accrue to individual employees. If the gift does benefit an individual employee, agency officials
shall consider whether that employee is responsible for matters affecting the potential donor that are currently
pending before the agency and the significance of the employee's role in such matters. Whether or not the proposed
gift benefits employees personally, we will consider: the nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the Commission
affecting the regulated source and the timing of the gift; the market value of the gift; and the frequency of gifts made
by a particular donor. Finally, we have adopted public disclosure and reporting requirements that are intended to
minimize or eliminate appearance problems. The Commission will keep a detailed record of all gifts accepted from
prohibited sources and make the following information publicly available concerning gifts that are accepted: the
identity of the prohibited source; a description of the gift; market value of the gift; documentation concerning
the prohibited source's reason for the gift; a verification from the prohibited source that the gift is unconditional
(not contingent on any promise or expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the donor in any
regulatory matter); and the date the gift is accepted by the Commission. The Commission shall file a semi-annual report
to Congress listing the gift, donor, and value of all gifts accepted from any donor under section 4(g)(3) authority.

6. We believe that, as mandated by section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act, the regulations adopted here will preclude
real and apparent conflicts of interest when the Commission exercises its new gift acceptance authority. In order
to ensure the integrity of our process, we have, as discussed above, adopted numerous safeguards which will require
careful consideration of conflicts of interest issues by impartial agency ethics officials. Our rules will also
ensure that our actions implementing this authority are exposed to the fullest possible public and congressional
scrutiny.

The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 which amended the Communications
Act by creating section 4(g)(3), 47 U.S.C. 154(g)(3). The provisions of this subpart shall apply to gifts, donations
and bequests made to the Commission itself. Travel reimbursement for attendance at, or participation in, government-sponsored
meetings or events required to carry out the Commission's statutory or regulatory functions may also be accepted
under this subpart. The acceptance of gifts by Commission employees, most notably gifts of food, drink and entertainment,
is governed by the government-wide standards of employee conduct established at 5 CFR part 2635. Travel, subsistence
and related expenses for non-government-sponsored meetings or events will continue to be accepted pursuant to the
Government Employees Training Act, 41 U.S.C. 4111 or 31 U.S.C. 1353, and its General Services Administration's implementing
regulations, 41 CFR 304&hyph;1.8, as applicable.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, on its own motion, amends the Table of FM Allotments to specify the correct classes of channels allotted
to various communities. These amendments are necessary to reflect changes that have been authorized in response
to applications filed by licensees and permittees operating on these channels. This action constitutes an editorial
change in the Table of Allotments. Therefore, a public notice and comment proceeding is unnecessary. See 5 U.S.C.
553(b) (A) and (B). With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current policy contained in NASA FAR Supplement &sect;1819.505 (c), (d), and (e) addresses situations in which a
small business set-aside is not initiated or pursued. In NFS &sect;1819.505(c), if the contracting officer disapproves
the Small Business Specialist's set-aside recommendation, the contracting officer shall promptly refer the case
to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for review. In NFS &sect;1819.505(d), cases involving
the non-initiation of a set-aside require referral to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for
review. NFS &sect;1819.505(e) addresses the situation when an SBA representative is not assigned or available,
and the contracting officer disagrees with the Small Business Specialist's recommendation on a small business set-aside,
or withdrawal or modification of a set-aside determination. The Small Business Specialist may make a written appeal
to the center procurement officer whose decision may overrule the Small Business Specialist's recommendation.
Upon later review of this action, SBA may disagree with the procurement officer's decision not to set aside a procurement
for small business and may appeal the decision. If SBA does pursue an appeal in the situations described in NFS &sect;1819.505
(c), (d), or (e), the Office of Procurement at NASA Headquarters wants the NASA center to notify them in writing as soon
as SBA appeals the procurement officer's decision.

approving the contracting officer's determination described in 1819.505(e), SBA may disagree with the procurement
officer's decision not to set aside a procurement for small business. If the SBA appeals the procurement officer's
decision, Code H should be notified in writing as soon as SBA appeals this decision. This notification should include
a history of the center and SBA discussions on the procurement as well as any actions the center has taken.

NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1842.801(a) requires the contracting officer to take action after receipt of a NASA Form
456, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended or Disapproved, or a DCAA Form 1, Notice of Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved
under Cost Reimbursement Contracts. However, when more than one contract is cited on the notice, the NFS does not specify
which contracting officer has responsibility for the action. NFS 1842.801 is changed to clarify that the contracting
officer with the most dollars affected is responsible for coordination with the other affected contracting officers,
including those of other federal agencies. The cross-reference at 1842.801(b) is also revised to identify the correct
cite. In addition, 1853.242&hyph;72 is revised to include the correct prescription cite. Other minor changes have
also been made for efficiency or clarification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Return the unsigned NASA Form 456 to the auditor with a detailed explanation of why the suspension or disapproval
is not being countersigned, and process the contractor's claim for payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When more than one NASA contract is affected by a notice, the NASA contracting officer with the largest amount of

officers, including those of other federal agencies, listed in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The NASA contracting officer, when in agreement with the NASA Form 456 initiated by the auditor, shall assign a
notice number and shall countersign the form. An original and three copies (which includes two acknowledgement copies,
one each for return to the contracting officer and the auditor) of the form shall be sent to the contractor by certified
mail, return receipt requested; one copy shall be attached to the Standard Form 1034 and each copy of the Standard Form
1034A (see 1842.7101(c)) on which the deduction for the suspension/disapproval is made, and one copy shall be sent
to the auditor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The total amount suspended or disapproved, as shown on the NASA Form 456, shall be inserted in the Differences block
of the Standard Form 1034 and 1034A, citing the applicable NASA Form 456. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) If the amount of the deduction is more than the amount of the public voucher, the installment method of deduction
shall be applied to the current and subsequent public vouchers until the amount is fully liquidated. The deductions
on any voucher may not exceed the voucher amount to avoid processing of a voucher in a credit amount. Public voucher(s)
with zero amounts must be forwarded to the fiscal or financial management office for appropriate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If deductions are in excess of contractor claims, recovery may be made through a direct refund from the contractor,
in the form of a check payable to NASA, or by a set-off deduction from the voucher(s) submitted by the contractor under
any other contract, unless those contracts contain a ``no set-off'' provision. If a set-off is affected, the voucher(s)
from which the deduction is made should be annotated to identify the contract and appropriation affected and the applicable
NASA Form 456.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS implements regulations for several management measures to prevent certain Gulf of Alaska (GOA) trawl fisheries
from taking an unnecessarily large share of the GOA halibut bycatch limit; amend the directed fishing standards to
prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing,
as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed
fishing; change the opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands management area (BSAI) from May 1 to January 1; and implement changes pertaining to the annual specification
and management of GOA halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. This action is necessary to reduce the likelihood
that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch limit established
for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish under halibut
bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives of the fishery
management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
of Commerce in accordance with the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish
Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the
U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations provide a framework process for the annual specification of GOA halibut PSC limits for trawl
and fixed gear fisheries and for apportioning these limits by season. Although these regulations limit the bycatch
of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have resulted in conflict among and preemption of groundfish
trawling operations in the GOA as different trawl fishery components compete for shares of the available halibut
PSC limit. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch cap before some groundfish Total Allowable Catch
(TAC) limits have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations in the GOA, even though the full groundfish
harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule implements the following three measures to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already
established for the trawl gear fisheries (&sect;672.20 (f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water
fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'');
and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep-water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards
(&sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder,
or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other,
more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a
result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species
at &sect;675.20(h)(2) also are revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also implements editorial changes to regulatory language pertaining to the annual specification
and management of GOA halibut PSC limits. In addition, NMFS apportions the 1994 GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries
and seasons as set out below:

An emergency rule implementing these measures was published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222), under section 305(c)
of the Magnuson Act. At its April 1994 meeting the Council voted to extend the emergency rule for another 90 days (59
FR 24965, May 13, 1994). A proposed rule to implement these measures was published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23044). A complete description of, and justification for, the management measures, including
editorial changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch amounts, was discussed in the preamble to the proposed
rule. Additional information also is available in the EA/RIR (see

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Splitting the halibut bycatch limit between the shallow-water fishery complex and the deep-water fishery complex
splits the limit between a well-observed fleet with 100-percent observer coverage (mainly in the deep-water fisheries)
and a poorly observed fleet with 30-percent observer coverage (mainly in the shallow-water fisheries). Because
the 30-percent boats have greater latitude to take an observer, the bycatch data collected for the shallow-water
fisheries would be biased and, therefore, less accurate than the data collected for the deep-water fisheries, thus
jeopardizing the management of the halibut bycatch limits. This action would degrade the scientific basis for halibut
bycatch management and is contrary to national standard 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with national standard 2, NMFS continues to monitor the groundfish fishery using the best information
available. Opportunities do exist in the 30-percent observer coverage fleet for vessel operators to manipulate
observer coverage to reduce or increase coverage in different fisheries. However, NMFS has taken measures to increase
observer coverage in the groundfish fleet to improve the accuracy of catch monitoring. A recent amendment to the Observer
Plan (59 FR 22133, April 29, 1994) changed observer coverage requirements for vessels required to obtain 30-percent
observer coverage. The amendment to the Observer Plan limits the manipulation of observer coverage by requiring
vessels to carry an observer during at least 30 percent of their fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels
participate for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. These vessels are also required to have
an observer on board the vessel during one trip in each fishery, as defined in the Observer Plan amendment, in which
they participate. These measures should reduce the potential for manipulation of observer coverage and increase
the amount of observer data available for the management of the specific fisheries.

Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors are not required to report harvests such that NMFS can reasonably attribute shoreside catch to a given
target with its appropriate bycatch. Currently, one target species is assigned per week, even though vessels delivering
to a plant may have targeted several different species. This system cannot be used to monitor scientifically a separate
shallow-water fisheries halibut bycatch limit and is inconsistent with national standard 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: For purposes of attributing halibut bycatch, NMFS assigns a target fishery based on maximum retained amounts (except
midwater pollock, for which pollock must comprise 95 percent or more of the total catch) and estimates halibut bycatch
for each unique combination of processor, gear type, and reporting area, on a weekly basis. Halibut bycatch is attributed
to one of the two fishery categories for which a trawl halibut bycatch allowance is made. Bycatch from the bottom pollock,
Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, or ``other species'' fisheries is attributed
to the shallow-water species complex. Bycatch from the sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, and arrowtooth
flounder fisheries is attributed to the deep-water species complex. NMFS does not have the ability to assign target
fisheries based on vessel hauls or individual vessel deliveries. Given this procedure, NMFS does monitor bycatch
consistent with the intent of the regulations and based on the best available scientific information.

Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes one editorial change in &sect;672.20(f)(3)(i) to clarify an inconsistency with respect
to paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of the same section. Section (f)(1)(iv) provides the authority to establish a separate halibut
PSC allowance by regulatory area and district; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;672.20(f)(3)(i) does not provide the authority for closures based on regulatory area or district once an allowance
is reached. Language has been added to paragraph &sect;672.20(f)(3)(i) to indicate that, upon attainment of a bycatch
allowance for the entire Gulf of Alaska or the applicable regulatory area or district, a closure would be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon reviewing the reasons for, and the comments on, this action, NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary for
fishery conservation and management.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule,
if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The reasons were
published in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 24965, May 5, 1994). As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis
was not prepared. NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. A copy of
the EA/RIR is available from NMFS (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has determined that delaying the effectiveness of this final rule for the entire 30 days under the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(d), is contrary to the public interest in orderly conduct of the fisheries in the EEZ. This
rule supersedes the original emergency rule implementing these measures which expires August 9, 1994. The fishery
has been operating under the emergency rule with a benefit to the fishery. To avoid an interruption in the fishery as
it is currently being conducted under the emergency rule, NMFS is waiving a portion of the 30-day delayed effectiveness
period for this rule to correspond with the expiration of the emergency rule.

, allow some or all of those vessels to continue to fish for groundfish using nonpelagic trawl gear under specified
conditions, subject to the other provisions of this part. In authorizing and conditioning such continued fishing
with bottom-trawl gear, the Regional Director will take into account the following considerations, and issue relevant
findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The risk of biological harm to halibut stocks and of socio-economic harm to authorized halibut users posed by continued
bottom trawling by these vessels; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The extent to which these vessels have avoided incidental halibut catches up to that point in the year;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The confidence of the Regional Director in the accuracy of the estimates of incidental halibut catches by these
vessels up to that point in the year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether observer coverage of these vessels is sufficient to assure adherence to the prescribed conditions and
to alert the Regional Director to increases in their incidental halibut catches; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The enforcement record of owners and operators of these vessels, and the confidence of the Regional Director that
adherence to the prescribed conditions can be assured in light of available enforcement resources.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule revises 32 CFR Part 516, Litigation, Army Regulation 27&hyph;40, Litigation, previously published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a proposed rule (57 FR 31852). This rule devotes a separate subpart to service of process (subpart B). The former
``investigative report'' is replaced by ``litigation report'' reflecting current usage (subpart C). A separate
subpart is devoted to individual liability (subpart D). This rule also treats environmental litigation (subpart
F), deletes coverage of criminal prosecutions in U.S. Magistrate and District Courts, delegates more authority
to the installation level to determine release of information and appearance of witnesses (subpart G); and updates
procedures to obtain release from local or state jury duty (subpart J).

(a) Defined. Process is a legal document that compels a defendant in an action to appear in court or to comply with the
court's demands, for example, in a civil case a summons or subpoena, or in a criminal case, a warrant for arrest, indictment,
contempt order, subpoena, or summons. Service of process is the delivery of the document to a defendant to notify him
of a claim or charge against him.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Policy. DA personnel will follow the guidance of this chapter when civil officials attempt to serve civil or criminal
process on individuals on Federal property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Procedures. Provost marshals shall ensure that installation law enforcement personnel are adequately trained
to respond to situations which arise with regard to service of civil and criminal process. SJAs or legal advisers shall
provide guidance to law enforcement personnel in these matters.

(a) Surrender of personnel. Guidance for surrender of military personnel to civilian law enforcement officials
is in Chapter 7 of AR 630&hyph;10 and AR l90&hyph;9. Army officials will cooperate with civilian law enforcement authorities
who seek the surrender of a soldier in connection with criminal charges. Special rules apply when a bail bondsman or

Service of civil process within the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Policy. DA officials will not prevent or evade the service or process in legal actions brought against the United
States or against themselves in their official capacities. If acceptance of service of process would interfere with
the performance of military duties, Army officials may designate a representative to accept service. DA personnel
sued in their individual capacity should seek legal counsel concerning voluntary acceptance of process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Requests for witnesses or evidence in civil proceedings. See subpart H to this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Process of Federal courts. Subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander, civil officials will
be permitted to serve Federal process. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, 45).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Process of state courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction that are not subject to the right to serve state process, the commander
or supervisor will determine whether the individual to be served wishes to accept service voluntarily. A JA or other
DA attorney will inform the individual of the legal effect of voluntary acceptance. If the individual does not desire
to accept service, the party requesting service will be notified that the nature of the exclusive Federal jurisdiction
precludes service by state authorities on the military installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On Federal property where the right to serve process is reserved by or granted to the state, in areas of concurrent
jurisdiction, or where the United States has only a proprietary interest, Army officials asked to facilitate service
of process will initially proceed as provided in the preceding subparagraph. If the individual declines to accept
service, the requesting party will be allowed to serve the process in accordance with applicable state law, subject
to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Process of foreign courts. A U.S. District Court may order service upon a person who resides in the judicial district
of any document issued in connection with a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal. (28 U.S.C. 1696). In
addition, the U.S. State Department has the power to receive a letter rogatory issued by a foreign or international
tribunal, to transmit it to a tribunal, officer or agency in the United States, and to return it after execution. (28
U.S.C. 1781). Absent a treaty or agreement to the contrary, these provisions will govern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Seizure of personal property. State and Federal courts issue orders (for example, writ of attachment) authorizing
a levy (seizure) of property to secure satisfaction of a judgment. DA personnel will comply with valid state or Federal
court orders commanding or authorizing the seizure of private property to the same extent that state or Federal process
is served.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Process of foreign courts. In foreign countries service of process issued by foreign courts will be made under
the law of the place of service, as modified by status of forces agreements, treaties or other agreements. In foreign
areas under exclusive U.S. jurisdiction, service of process issued by foreign courts will be made under the law specified
by appropriate U.S. authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Process of Federal courts. Service of process on U.S. citizens or residents may be accomplished under the following
provisions: The Hague Convention, reprinted in 28 USCA Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, following Rule 4; Fed. R.
Civ. P. 4(i); 28 USC 1781 and 1783; and, the rules of the Federal court concerned. If a DA official receives a request
to serve Federal process on a person overseas, he will determine if the individual wishes to accept service voluntarily.
Individuals will be permitted to seek counsel. If the person will not accept service voluntarily, the party requesting
service will be notified and advised to follow procedures prescribed by the law of the foreign country concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Process of state courts. If a DA official receives a request to serve state court process on a person overseas, he
will determine if the individual wishes to accept service voluntarily. Individuals will be permitted to seek counsel.
If the person will not accept service voluntarily, the party requesting service will be notified and advised to follow
procedures prescribed by the law of the foreign country concerned. (See, for example, The Hague Convention, reprinted
in 28 USCA Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, following Rule 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Suits against the United States. DA personnel served with foreign civil process will notify the appropriate SJA
or legal adviser, who will return the document to the issuing authority explaining the lack of authority to accept
service for the United States. Service on the United States must be made upon DOJ through established diplomatic channels.

(a) Immediate notice to HQDA. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of litigation in which the United States has an interest,
and it appears that HQDA is not aware of the action, the SJA or legal adviser will telephonically notify the responsible
HQDA office. (See &sect;516.15(c)). Immediate notice is particularly important when litigation involves one of
the following: a lawsuit against an employee in his individual capacity; a motion for a temporary restraining order
or preliminary injunction; a habeas corpus proceeding; a judicial or administrative proceeding involving less
than 60 days to file an answer; and, actions with possible Congressional, Secretarial, or Army Staff interest. For
legal proceedings instituted in foreign tribunals, the SJA or legal adviser will also notify the major overseas commander
concerned and the appropriate U.S. Embassy or Legation. A telephonic report to HQDA should include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title or style of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A soldier may file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his continued custody (usually in a post court-martial
situation) or retention in the Army. As is the case with injunctive relief in the preceding paragraph, installation
SJAs and legal advisers must take immediate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notification to Litigation Division and U.S. Attorney. The SJA or legal adviser will notify Litigation Division
and the responsible U.S. Attorney's Office immediately upon learning that a petition for writ of habeas corpus has
been filed. All relevant documentary evidence supporting the challenged action should be assembled immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Procedures in habeas corpus. Upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court will dismiss the
petition, issue the writ, or order the respondent to show cause why it should not be granted. If a writ or order to show
cause is issued, the SJA or legal adviser should be prepared to assist the responsible Litigation Division or DOJ attorney
in preparing a return and answer. If so directed, the SJA will also prepare a memorandum of points and authorities to
accompany the return and answer. The government's response should cover the following: whether the Army has custody
of petitioner; whether respondent and petitioner are within the judicial district; and, whether appellate or administrative
remedies have been exhausted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Writs or orders issued by state courts. No state court, after being judicially informed that a petitioner is in
custody under the authority of the United States, should interfere with that custody or require that petitioner be
brought before the state court. A deserter, apprehended by any civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders
under the laws of the United States or of any state, district, territory, or possession of the United States, is in custody
by authority of the United States. If a writ of habeas corpus is issued by a state court, the SJA or legal adviser will
seek guidance from Litigation Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Foreign court orders. A foreign court should not inquire into the legality of restraint of a person held by U.S.
military authority. If a foreign court issues any process in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, the SJA or legal adviser
will immediately report the matter to the appropriate U.S. forces commander and to Litigation Division.

Litigation against government contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A contract might require that the government reimburse a contractor (or subcontractor) for adverse
judgments or litigation expenses. Unless a contractor or subcontractor facing a lawsuit requests representation
by DOJ, the Army presumes the contractor will obtain private counsel to defend the case. If the contract so allows,
however, the contractor may request and HQDA may recommend that DOJ represent the contractor if it is in the best interests
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Actions by SJA or legal adviser. If a contractor or subcontractor faces litigation and the underlying contract
with the government requires reimbursement for adverse judgments or costs of the litigation, the SJA or legal adviser,
through the contracting officer, should determine if the contractor desires representation by DOJ. If so, the contractor
or authorized agent will sign a request for representation. (See Figure D&hyph;3, Appendix G, of this part.) The SJA
or legal adviser will determine whether, in his opinion, representation by DOJ should be granted. He will prepare
a memorandum to support his recommendation, especially concerning any issue regarding the government's obligation
to reimburse the contractor under the contract. The SJA or legal adviser will forward his memorandum, along with the
contractor's request, to Litigation Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Actions by Litigation Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will evaluate the submission and decide if it
is in the Army's best interest that the request be granted. He will prepare a memorandum supporting his decision and
send the packet to DOJ. The Chief's decision constitutes the final DA position on the matter. If DOJ grants the contractor's
request, the Chief, Litigation Division, will ensure that the contractor is notified through the SJA or legal adviser
and the contracting officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Private Counsel. A contractor represented by DOJ may ask that private counsel assist the DOJ attorney in the litigation.
The DOJ attorney will remain in control of the litigation, and the fees for private counsel will not be reimbursable
except under unusual circumstances. The contractor must seek both DOJ and DA approval to employ private counsel when
DOJ representation has been granted. Even if DOJ and DA grant authority to employ private counsel, the contracting
officer will determine whether a contractor will be reimbursed under the contract for private counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Settlement. The contractor, unless the contract specifies otherwise, will ultimately decide whether to compromise
a suit. Reimbursement under the contract is determined by the contracting officer, with the advice of his attorney.

The SJA or legal adviser will prepare a litigation report when directed by HQDA. The report will contain the following
sections: Statement of Facts; Setoff or Counterclaim; Responses to Pleadings; Memorandum of Law; Witness List;
and, Exhibits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Statement of Facts. Include a complete statement of the facts upon which the action and any defense thereto are
based. Where possible, support facts by reference to documents or witness statements. Include details of previous
administrative actions, such as the filing and results of an administrative claim. If the action is predicated on
the Federal Tort Claims Act, include a description of the plaintiff's relationship to the United States, its instrumentalities,
or its contractors. Also include a statement whether an insurance company or other third party has an interest in the
plaintiff's claim by subrogation or otherwise and whether there are additional claims related to the same incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Setoff or Counterclaim. Discuss whether setoff or counterclaim exists. If so, highlight the supportive facts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Responses to Pleadings. Prepare a draft answer or other appropriate response to the pleadings. (See Figure C&hyph;1,
to this part). Discuss whether allegations of fact are well-founded. Refer to evidence that refutes factual allegations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Memorandum of Law. Include a brief statement of the applicable law with citations to legal authority. Discussions
of local law, if applicable, should cover relevant issues such as measure of damages, scope of employment, effect
of contributory negligence, or limitations upon death and survival actions. Do not unduly delay submission of a litigation
report to prepare a comprehensive memorandum of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Potential witness information. List each person having information relevant to the case and provide an office
address and telephone number. If there is no objection, provide the individual's social security account number,
home address, and telephone number. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform). Finally, summarize the information or potential testimony that each person listed could provide.

(f) Exhibits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Attach a copy of all relevant documents. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil
Justice Reform). Unless otherwise directed by HQDA, each exhibit should be tabbed and internally paginated. References
to exhibits in the litigation report should be to page numbers of particular exhibits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Copies of relevant reports of claims officers, investigating officers, boards or similar data should be attached,
although such reports will not obviate the requirement for preparation of a complete litigation report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prepare an index of tabs and exhibits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where a relevant document has been released pursuant to a FOIA request, provide a copy of the response, or otherwise
identify the requestor and the records released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Distribution and number of copies. Unless HQDA directs otherwise, SJAs or legal advisers will mail (first class)
an original and one copy of the litigation report to the responsible HQDA office (See &sect;516.15 of this part) and
one copy to the U.S. Attorney's Office handling the case. If possible, record the litigation report onto a magnetic
diskette, using either WordPerfect, Enable, or ACSII, and send it to Litigation Division.

(a) General. The DA Form 4 (See Figure C&hyph;2, Appendix G, of this part) is used to authenticate Army records or documents.
Documents attached to a properly prepared and sealed DA Form 4 are self-authenticating. (See Fed. R. Evid. 902). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Preparation at the installation level. A DA Form 4 need not be prepared until the trial attorney presenting the
government's case identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will need at trial. Once documents
are identified, the custodian of the documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See Figure C&hyph;2, Appendix
G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents.
Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each document need not be mentioned specifically.
Only the upper portion of the form should be executed at the local level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Actions at HQDA. Upon receipt of the DA Form 4 with documents attached thereto, HQDA will affix a ribbon and seal
and deliver it to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. That office will place the
official Army seal on the packet.

(a) General. Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. l746, whenever any matter is required or permitted to be established
or proven by a sworn statement, oath or affidavit, such matter may also be established or proven by an unsworn written
declaration under penalty of perjury. Because such declaration does not require a notary or other official to administer
oaths, individuals preparing statements for use in litigation should consider using this format. (See Figure C&hyph;3,

This subpart guidance when DA personnel, as a result of the performance of their official duties, are either sued in
their personal capacity, or are charged in a criminal proceeding. Examples of civil actions alleging individual
liability include the following: a medical malpractice lawsuit against health care providers; suits resulting
from motor vehicle accidents; constitutional torts; or, common law torts such as assault, libel, or intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Likewise, state or Federal criminal charges can arise from the performance of
official duties, including environmental crimes or motor vehicle accidents.

in their individual capacity as a result of performance of their official duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) DOJ policy on representation. If in the best interest of the United States, upon request of the individual concerned,
and upon certification by his agency that he was acting within the scope of his employment, DOJ may represent present
and former DA personnel sued individually as a result of actions taken within the scope of their employment. Representation
can be declined for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the following: the employee was not acting within
the scope of his office; there is a conflict of interest; or, actions were not taken in a good faith effort to conform
to law.

Procedures for obtaining certification and DOJ representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) SJA or legal adviser procedures. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of a criminal charge or of a lawsuit alleging
individual liability against DA personnel as a result of performance of official duties, he will take the following
actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Immediately notify Litigation Division and the appropriate U.S. Attorney and FAX or express deliver copies of
process and pleadings to each office. Where time for response is limited, request that the U.S. Attorney either petition
the court for an extension of time, or provide temporary counsel and representation pending formal approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Investigate whether the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment. Obtain, if possible,
statements from the defendant, supervisors, and witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Advise the individual defendant of the rights and conditions set out in 28 CFR 50.15, which include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) His right to request representation by a DOJ attorney and, in appropriate cases, certification that he was acting
within the scope of employment. (See 28 U.S.C. 2679; 28 CFR 50.15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The right to request private counsel at government expense, subject to the availability of funds. (See 28 CFR
50.16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) That the United States is not obligated to pay or indemnify defendant for any judgment rendered against him in
his individual capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the defendant desires certification or DOJ representation, have him sign a request. (See Figure D&hyph;1,
Appendix G, of this part). Obtain a signed scope of employment statement from the defendant's supervisor. (Figure
D&hyph;2, Appendix G, of this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Prepare a report with, at a minimum, the following information: facts surrounding the incident for which defendant
is being sued and those relating to scope of employment; the SJA's or legal adviser's conclusions concerning scope
of employment; and, a recommendation whether certification by the Attorney General or representation by a DOJ attorney
should be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In cases involving National Guard personnel, address also the following: whether defendant was acting in a state
(Title 32 U.S.C.) or Federal (Title 10 U.S.C.) capacity during relevant periods (include orders); if defendant was
acting under state authority, is it nevertheless in the interest of the United States to represent the individual;
any impact on policies or practices of DA, the National Guard Bureau, or DOD; whether the relief requested can be granted
only by a Federal officer or agency; and, whether Federal law or regulation required actions by state officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Send the report, request for representation, and scope of employment statements to Chief, Litigation Division.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. The Chief, Litigation Division, will review the report and evidence
regarding representation and scope of employment and will determine whether certification and representation
are appropriate. He will send his recommendation to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or office within DOJ. The Chief,
Litigation Division, will notify the defendant of DOJ's decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. DA personnel, sued in their individual capacity or facing criminal charges as a result of performance
of official duties, have no right to employ a private sector counsel at government expense or to expect reimbursement
for the same. For proceedings in the United States, a request for employment of counsel at government expense may be
approved by DOJ, contingent among other things upon availability of funds and a determination that employment of
private counsel at government expense is in the best interests of the United States. (See 28 CFR 50.16). Special rules
apply in overseas areas. (See paragraph (e) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Individual request procedures. The individual will prepare a request that private counsel be employed for him
at government expense. The request must also contain the following statement: ``I understand that the United States
is not required to employ private counsel on my behalf, and that I may be responsible for expenses incurred prior to
proper authorization by the Department of the Army or the Department of Justice.''

who will make a recommendation and forward the packet to the local SJA or legal adviser. The SJA or legal adviser will
prepare his own recommendation and forward the matter to Litigation Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. If the Chief, Litigation Division, determines that the request for
private counsel is meritorious, he will prepare an appropriate recommendation and forward the packet to Civil Division,
DOJ, for final approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Special actions in foreign countries. Employment of private counsel in foreign proceedings is governed by AR
27&hyph;50 (Status of Forces Policies, Procedures, and Information). Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1037, soldiers,
as well as employees or those accompanying the armed forces overseas, may be granted individual counsel in civil and
criminal proceedings, under the criteria of AR 27&hyph;50.

Requests for indemnification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Policy. An individual liable for a judgment rendered against him in his individual capacity has no right to reimbursement
from DA. DA will consider, however, a request for indemnification from DA personnel where conduct within the scope
of official duties has resulted in personal liability and indemnification is in the best interests of the United States.
Indemnification is strictly contingent upon an appropriation to pay the judgment, as well as availability of such
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Individual request procedures. An individual against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered may request
indemnification. The request must include, at a minimum, the following: how the employee was acting within the scope
of his employment; whether the requestor has insurance or any other source of indemnification; and, how reimbursement
is in the best interests of the United States. The request must also contain the following statements: ``I understand
that acceptance of this request for indemnification for processing by DA does not constitute an acceptance of any
obligation to make such a payment. I also understand that payment is contingent on availability of funds and that it
will only be made if such is determined to be in the best interests of the United States.'' The individual should attach
a copy of relevant documents, for example, court's opinion, judgment, and other allied papers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Supervisory and SJA procedures. The request for indemnification will be submitted through supervisory channels
to the local SJA or legal adviser. Each supervisor will make a recommendation on the propriety of reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. Requests for indemnification will be forwarded to Chief, Litigation
Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will examine the submission and, after consultation with DOJ or other
agencies, forward the packet with his recommendation to the Army General Counsel. The General Counsel will obtain
a final decision by the Secretary of the Army or his designee on the matter. There is no administrative appeal of the
Secretary's (or his designee's) decision.

General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651). The act provides for the recovery of medical care expenses
incurred because of a tortfeasor's actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711). The act provides for the collection of claims for money or property
arising from the activities of Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Third-party Collection Program (10 U.S.C. 1095). The statute provides for collection of reasonable costs of
health-care services, provided in facilities of the uniformed services to covered beneficiaries, from private
insurers or third-party payers. In accordance with DOD Instruction 6010.15, ``Third Party Collection (TPC) Program,''
7 March 1991, the authority to settle or waive a DOD claim under the act is delegated to TJAG or to his designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Executive Order No. 12778, (56 FR 55195; 3 CFR, 1991 Comp. p. 359), Civil Justice Reform. This order establishes
several requirements on Federal agencies involved in litigation or contemplating filing an action on behalf of the
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) AR 27&hyph;20, Claims. Chapter l4 (Affirmative Claims) contains comprehensive guidance for Recovery Judge
Advocates (RJAs) in the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement, and waiver of claims
in favor of the U.S. for property damage and for medical care claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Duties and Procedures. In accordance with Chapter 14, AR 27&hyph;20, Commander, USARCS, has supervisory responsibility
over the administrative processing of property and medical care claims by RJAs. The Commander, U.S. Army Health Services
Command (HSC), has supervisory responsibility over the Third Party Collection Program (TPCP). The HSC TPCP Implementation
Plan effects DOD Instruction 6010.15 and establishes procedures for processing TPC claims. Litigation Division,
in conjunction with DOJ and U.S. Attorneys, is responsible for pursuing, through litigation, claims not resolved
administratively. DOJ is ultimately responsible for initiating litigation for the United States. (28 U.S.C. 515).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Assertion of claims on behalf of the United States by private attorneys. The Army incurs potentially recoverable
expenses when it provides medical care to soldiers or dependents injured by tortfeasors (for example, a soldier is
hospitalized after an automobile accident). When injured personnel employ a private attorney to sue the tortfeasor,
it may be in the Government's best interests to enter into an agreement with the private attorney to include the Army's
medical care claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Statute of limitations. There is a three year statute of limitations for actions in favor of the U.S. for money damages
founded upon tort. (28 U.S.C. 2415(b)). Limitations periods can vary, however, depending upon the theory of liability
and the jurisdiction involved. RJAs must be alert to the applicable period of limitations. A case referred for litigation
should arrive at Litigation Division at least 6 months before the expiration of the limitations period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reporting of recoveries. Amounts recovered through litigation will be reported to USARCS by Tort Branch, Litigation
Division, or, where referred directly to a U.S. Attorney or the Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF), by the
responsible RJA.

litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Criteria for referral. The RJA will forward the claims file and a litigation report (See &sect;516.35 of this part)
through USARCS to Litigation Division when the claim has not been resolved administratively and any of the following
conditions exist: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claim exceeds $5,000; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It involves collection from the injured party or his attorney; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claim raises an important question of policy; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is potential for a significant precedent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Alternative methods. When none of the conditions cited in the preceding subparagraph are present, the RJA may
refer the claim directly to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the prospective defendant resides. Similar
property claims may be referred through USARCS to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF) rather than directly
to the U.S. Attorney. Notice of all such referrals shall be provided through USARCS to Tort Branch, Litigation Division.
The RJA should be ready to provide support to the U.S. Attorney if requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Closing Files. A file referred directly to the U.S. Attorney will be closed if the U.S. Attorney determines further
action is unwarranted. If the RJA disagrees, the file should be forwarded with the RJA's recommendation through USARCS
to Litigation Division.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. In preparing a referral for litigation the RJA will ensure the file contains at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A litigation report (See &sect;516.23 of this part) that demonstrates a factual basis for the claim and a theory
of recovery under applicable state law. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Copies of all medical records and bills reflecting the reasonable value of the medical care furnished to the injured
party, including DA Form 2631&hyph;R (Medical Care-Third Party Liability Notification), and DA Form 3154 (MSA Invoice
and Receipt). These documents should be authenticated as necessary on a DA Form 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Copies of all documents necessary to establish the value of lost or damaged property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transmittal letter. The letter of transmittal referring the claim for litigation should briefly summarize the
facts giving rise to the claim and the collection actions previously taken by the Army and the injured party.

(a) General. The majority of cases filed on behalf of the United States will fall under this subpart E. All other civil
cases which cannot be resolved administratively or by direct referral to DOJ will be forwarded through channels to
Litigation Division with a litigation report. (See &sect;516.23 of this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Government contractors. It may be in the Government's best interest to authorize a Government contractor, whose
contract provides for the reimbursement of necessary legal expenses, to employ private counsel to initiate legal
proceedings against a third party. To obtain authorization to employ private counsel in such instances the contractor
should follow the procedures in &sect;516.21(c) of this part.

(a) General. U.S. Attorneys are authorized to accept a Federal agency's request for the following purposes: to initiate
an action to recover possession of real property from tenants, trespassers, and others; to enjoin trespasses on Federal
property; and, to collect delinquent rentals or damages for use and occupancy of real property for amounts less than
$200,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Procedures. When eviction or an action to collect delinquent rent is necessary, the SJA or legal adviser will notify
General Litigation Branch, Litigation Division, of the situation. If approved by Litigation Division, the SJA or
legal adviser may ask the U.S. Attorney to file suit. A copy of the complaint will be sent to Litigation Division. DOJ
can take action to evict the occupants for violation of the terms of occupancy and collect delinquent rent or other
charges. Once the matter has been referred to the U.S. Attorney, payments for rent should be sent to the U.S. Attorney.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Introduction. This subpart implements DOD Directive 5405.2 (See Appendix C to this part and 32 CFR part 97). It
governs the release of official information and the appearance of present and former DA personnel as witnesses in
response to requests for interviews, notices of depositions, subpoenas, and other requests or orders related to
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Requests for records, if not in the nature of legal process, should be processed
under AR 25&hyph;55 (The Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program) or AR 340&hyph;21 (The Army Privacy
Program). This subpart pertains to any request for witnesses, documents, or information for all types of litigation,
including requests by private litigants, requests by State or U.S. attorneys, requests by foreign officials or tribunals,
subpoenas for records or testimony, notices of depositions, interview requests, civil cases, criminal proceedings,
private litigation, or litigation in which the United States has an interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General Rule. Except as authorized by this subpart, present or former DA personnel will not disclose official
information (See Appendix F_Glossary) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exception. Present or former DA personnel may disclose official information if they obtain the written approval
of the appropriate SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Referral to deciding official. If present or former DA personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for
attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or request for an interview related to actual or potential
litigation, and it appears the subpoena, order, or request seeks disclosures described in a above, the individual
should immediately advise the appropriate SJA or legal adviser. If the SJA or legal adviser cannot informally satisfy
the subpoena, order, or request in accordance with &sect;&sect;516.43 through 516.50 of this subpart, he should
consult with Litigation Division.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Requesters' responsibilities. Individuals seeking official information must submit, at least 14 days before
the desired date of production, a specific written request setting forth the nature and relevance of the official
information sought. (Requesters can be referred to this Subpart G). Subject to &sect;516.47(a), present and former
DA personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters specified in
writing and properly approved by the SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy
v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Litigation in which the United States has an interest. If a subpoena, order, or request relates to litigation in
which the United States has an interest and for which litigation responsibility has not been delegated, the SJA or
legal adviser will coordinate with Litigation Division under &sect;516.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Motions to stay or quash subpoenas. A subpoena should never be ignored, and an SJA or legal adviser should seek assistance
from Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney's office whenever necessary. If a response to a subpoena or order is
required before a release determination can be made or before Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney can be contacted,
the SJA or legal adviser will do the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Furnish the court or tribunal a copy of this regulation (32 CFR part 516, Subpart G) and applicable case law (See
United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Inform the court or tribunal that the requesting individual has not complied with this Chapter, as set out in 32
CFR 97 &amp; 516, or that the subpoena or order is being reviewed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Seek to stay the subpoena or order pending the requestor's compliance with this chapter or final determination
by Litigation Division; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the court or other tribunal declines to quash or stay the subpoena or order, inform Litigation Division immediately
so a decision can be made whether to challenge the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides not to challenge
the subpoena or order, the affected personnel will comply with the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides
to challenge the subpoena or order, it will direct the affected personnel to respectfully decline to comply with the
subpoena or order. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Classified or sensitive information. Only Litigation Division may authorize the release of official information
or appearance of DA personnel as witnesses in litigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, or intelligence
sources and methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Requests for Inspector General records or testimony. IG records, and information obtained through performance
of IG duties, are official information under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Army. (See AR 20&hyph;l,
Chapter 3.) IG records frequently contain sensitive official information that may be classified or obtained under
guarantees of confidentiality. When justification exists, DA attorneys will seek court protection from disclosure
of IG records and information. No DA personnel will release IG records or disclose information obtained through performance
of IG duties without the approval of The Secretary of the Army, The Inspector General, TIG Legal Advisor, or Chief,
Litigation Division. When IG personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial
proceeding, or a request for an interview which the IG reasonably believes is related to actual or potential litigation
concerning IG records or related information, they should immediately notify the Inspector General Legal Adviser
or the Chief, Litigation Division. IG personnel will follow the guidance of this subpart concerning actions to be
taken regarding disclosure and testimony.

(a) Preservation of originals. To preserve the integrity of DA records, DA personnel will submit properly authenticated
copies rather than originals of documents or records for use in legal proceedings, unless directed otherwise by Litigation
Division. (See 28 U.S.C. 1733.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Authentication of copies. Copies of DA records approved for release can be authenticated for introduction in
evidence by use of DA Form 4. (See &sect;516.25 for instructions.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Records maintained in U.S. Army Engineer Districts and Divisions will be forwarded to HQDA(CECC&hyph;K), WASH
DC 20314&hyph;1000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All other records will be forwarded to the appropriate office at HQDA (See &sect;516.42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Fees and charges. AR 37&hyph;60 prescribes the schedule of fees and charges for searching, copying, and certifying
Army records for release in response to litigation-related requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Release of records of other agencies. Normally an individual requesting records originating in agencies outside
DA (that is, FBI reports, local police reports, civilian hospital records) that are also included in Army records
should be advised to direct his inquiry to the originating agency.

Determination of release authorization.

(a) Policy. DA policy is to make official information reasonably available for use in Federal and state courts and
by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public
disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Releasability factors. In deciding whether to authorize release of official information, the deciding official
should consider the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Has the requester complied with DA policy governing the release of official documents in &sect;516.41(d) of this
part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the request unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the disclosure appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the matter in which the request arose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Would the disclosure violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Is the disclosure appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Would the disclosure reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DOD Information Security Program
under AR 380&hyph;5, unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to 32 CFR &sect;250, or other
matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal
the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or confidential commercial
or financial information, or, otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Would the disclosure violate any person's expectation of confidentiality or privacy?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the deciding official, after considering the factors set forth in &sect;536.44, determines that all or part of
requested official records are releasable, copies of the records should be furnished to the requester.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. If the deciding official, after considering the factors in &sect;516.44, determines that all or part
of requested official records should not be released, he will promptly communicate directly with the attorney or
individual who caused the issuance of the subpoena, order, or request and seek to resolve the matter informally. If
the subpoena or order is invalid, he should explain the basis of the invalidity. The deciding official should also
explain why the records requested are privileged from release. The deciding official should attempt to obtain the
agreement of the requester to withdraw the subpoena, order, or request or to modify the subpoena, order, or request
so that it pertains only to records which may be released. (See Figure G&hyph;1, Appendix G, of this part.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A subpoena duces tecum or other legal process signed by an attorney or clerk of court for records protected by the
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, does not justify the release of the protected records. The deciding official should explain
to the requester that the Privacy Act precludes disclosure of records in a system of records without the written consent
of the subject of the records or ``pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.'' (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11)).
An ``order of the court'' for the purpose of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11) is an order or writ requiring the production
of the records, signed by a judge or magistrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unclassified records otherwise privileged from release under 5 U.S.C. 552a may be released to the court under
either of the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The subpoena is accompanied by an order signed by a judge or magistrate, or such order is separately served, that
orders the person to whom the records pertain to release the specific records, or that orders copies of the records
be delivered to the clerk of court, and indicates that the court has determined the materiality of the records and the
nonavailability of a claim of privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The clerk of the court is empowered by local statute or practice to receive the records under seal subject to request
that they be withheld from the parties until the court determines whether the records are material to the issues and
until any question of privilege is resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Subpoenas for alcohol abuse or drug abuse treatment records must be processed under 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 290ee-3,
and Public Health Service regulations published at 42 CFR 2.1_2.67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Upon request, SJAs and legal advisers may furnish to the attorney for the injured party or the tortfeasor's attorney
or insurance company a copy of the narrative summary of medical care that relates to a claim under Subpart E of this part.
If additional medical records are requested, only those that directly pertain to the pending action will be furnished.
If furnishing copies of medical records would prejudice the cause of action, the matter will be reported to Litigation
Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Referral to Litigation Division. If the SJA or legal adviser is not able to resolve a request for Army records informally,
he should contact Litigation Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Litigation Division may respond to subpoenas or orders for records privileged from release by informing the local
U.S. Attorney about the subpoena and requesting that office file a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective
order. The records privileged from release should be retained by the custodian pending the court's ruling upon the
government's motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a motion to quash or for a protective order is not filed, or the motion is unsuccessful, and the appropriate
DA official has determined that no further efforts will be made to protect the records, copies of the records (authenticated
if necessary) will be submitted to the court (or to the clerk of court) in response to the subpoena or order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Classified and privileged materials. Requests from DOJ, U.S. Attorneys, or attorneys for other governmental
entities for records which are classified or otherwise privileged from release will be referred to Litigation Division.

(a) Policy. The involvement of present or former DA personnel in private litigation is solely a personal matter between
the witness and the requesting party, unless one or more of the following conditions apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The testimony involves official information. (See Appendix F_Glossary to this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The witness is to testify as an expert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The absence of the witness from duty will seriously interfere with the accomplishment of a military mission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Former DA personnel. Former DA personnel may freely respond to requests for interviews and subpoenas except in
instances involving official information (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or concerning expert testimony prohibited
by &sect;516.49. In those instances, the subject of the request or subpoena should take the action specified in &sect;&sect;516.41(c)
and 516.42.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Present DA personnel. Present DA personnel will refer all requests for interviews and subpoenas for testimony
in private litigation through their supervisor to the appropriate SJA or legal adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Discretion to testify. Any individual not wishing to grant an interview or to testify concerning private litigation
may seek the advice of an Army attorney concerning the consequences, if any, of refusal. Any individual not authorized
to consult with Army counsel should consult with private counsel, at no expense to the government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In instances involving &sect;516.47(a)(1), the matter will be referred to the SJA or legal adviser serving the
organization of the individual whose testimony is requested, or to HQDA pursuant to &sect;516.47(a). The deciding
official will determine whether to release the information sought under the principles established in &sect;516.44.
If funding by the United States is requested, see &sect;516.55(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the deciding official determines that the information may be released, the individual will be permitted to
be interviewed, deposed, or to appear as a witness in court provided such interview or appearance is consistent with
the requirements of &sect;&sect;516.49 and 516.50. (See, for example, Figure G&hyph;2, Appendix G, to this part).
A JA or DA civilian attorney should be present during any interview or testimony to act as legal representative of the
Army. If a question seeks information not previously authorized for release, the legal representative will advise
the witness not to answer. If necessary to avoid release of the information, the legal representative will advise
the witness to terminate the interview or deposition, or in the case of testimony in court, advise the judge that DOD
directives and Army regulations preclude the witness from answering without HQDA approval. Every effort should
be made, however, to substitute releasable information and to continue the interview or testimony.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General rule. Present DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony
either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United States has an interest for a party other than the United
States. Former DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning
official information, subjects, or activities either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United
States has an interest for a party other than the United States. (See Figure G&hyph;3, Appendix G of this part). An SJA
or legal adviser is authorized to deny a request for expert testimony, which decision may be appealed to Litigation
Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exception to the general prohibition. If a requester can show exceptional need or unique circumstances, and the
anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the United States, Litigation Division may grant special
written authorization for present or former DA personnel to testify as expert or opinion witnesses at no expense to
the United States. In no event may present or former DA personnel furnish expert or opinion testimony in a case in which
the United States has an interest for a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Exception for AMEDD personnel. Members of the Army medical department or other qualified specialists may testify
in private litigation with the following limitations (See Figure G&hyph;4, Appendix G, of this part):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The litigation involves patients they have treated, investigations they have made, laboratory tests they have
conducted, or other actions taken in the regular course of their duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) They limit their testimony to factual matters such as the following: their observations of the patient or other
operative facts; the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken; course of recovery or steps required for repair
of damage suffered; and, contemplated future treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Their testimony may not extend to expert or opinion testimony, to hypothetical questions, or to a prognosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Court-ordered expert or opinion testimony. If a court or other appropriate authority orders expert or opinion
testimony, the witness will immediately notify Litigation Division. If Litigation Division determines it will
not challenge the subpoena or order, the witness will comply with the subpoena or order. If directed by Litigation
Division, however, the witness will respectfully decline to comply with the subpoena or order. (See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reassignment of witnesses. When requested by the U.S. Attorney, the SJA or legal adviser will ensure that no witnesses
are reassigned from the judicial district without advising the DOJ attorney. If a witness is vital to the government's
case and trial is imminent, the SJA or legal adviser should make informal arrangements to retain the witness in the
command until trial. If this is not feasible, or if a satisfactory arrangement cannot be reached with the DOJ attorney,
the SJA or legal adviser should notify Litigation Division.

Witnesses for the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Status of witness. A military member authorized to appear as a witness for the United States, including those authorized
to appear under &sect;516.55(d), will be placed on temporary duty. If USAR or NG personnel are requested as witnesses
for the United States, and if their testimony arises from their active duty service, they should be placed on active
duty to testify. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under Federal Personnel Manual 630, subchapter
10. DA personnel who appear as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government's claim for medical care expenses
are witnesses for the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Travel arrangements. Travel arrangements for witnesses for the United States normally are made by DOJ through
Litigation Division for other than local travel. Litigation Division will issue instructions for this travel, including
fund citation, to the appropriate commander. A U.S. Attorney, or an attorney asserting the government's medical
care claim under Subpart E, may make arrangements for local travel through the SJA or legal adviser for attendance
of a witness who is stationed at an installation within the same judicial district, or not more than 100 miles from the
place where testifying. Other requests, including those under &sect;516.55(d), will be referred to Litigation
Division. The instructions from Litigation Division, or the request from the U.S. Attorney or the attorney asserting
the government's claim, will serve as a basis for the issuance of appropriate travel orders by the local commander.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Travel and per diem expenses. The witness' commander or supervisor should ensure the witness has sufficient funds
to defray expenses. The SJA or legal adviser will provide assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where local travel is performed at the request of a U.S. Attorney and the testimony does not involve information
acquired in the performance of duties, transportation arrangements and any per diem expenses are the responsibility
of the U.S. Attorney.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An attorney asserting the government's medical care or property claim may be required to advance local travel
expense money to the witness requested and to include these in recoverable costs where the government's claim is not
large enough to justify expenditures of government travel funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other local travel and per diem expense for cases involving Army activities or claims are proper expenses of the
command issuing the orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Litigation Division will furnish travel expense and per diem funds for other than local travel and will receive
reimbursement from DOJ or other government agencies as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Status of witness. If authorized to appear as a witness for a state or private litigant, and the testimony to be given
relates to information obtained in the performance of official duties, a military member will attend in a permissive
TDY status. If authorized to appear as a witness, but the testimony does not relate to information obtained in the performance
of official duties, a military member may be granted a pass or permissive TDY under AR 630&hyph;5, or be required to
take ordinary leave. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under 5 CFR Chapter I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Travel arrangements. The requesting party or state agency will make all travel arrangements for attendance of
DA personnel authorized to appear as witnesses for a state or private litigant. The local commander may issue appropriate
orders when necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Travel expenses. The United States may not pay travel, meals, and lodging expenses of the witness, other than normal
allowances for subsistence pursuant to the DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual. These expenses
are solely a matter between the witness and the party seeking his appearance. Witnesses ordinarily should be advised
to require advance payment of such expenses. Military personnel authorized to appear in a pass or permissive TDY status
are not entitled to receive witness attendance fees, but may accept travel, meals, and lodging expense money from
the requesting litigant. All witness fees tendered the military member, to the extent they exceed such actual expenses
of the member, will be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States. A civilian employee authorized to appear in his
or her official capacity will accept the authorized witness fees, in addition to the allowance for travel and subsistence,
and make disposition of the witness fees as instructed by his or her personnel office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Referral to the SJA. Requests or subpoenas from a foreign government or tribunal for present DA personnel stationed
or employed within that country to be interviewed or to appear as witnesses will be forwarded to the SJA of the command
exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the unit to which the individual is assigned, attached, or employed.
The SJA will determine the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether a consideration listed in &sect;516.47(a)(1) through (a)(3) applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the information requested is releasable under the principles established in &sect;516.43 through &sect;516.46.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the approval of the American Embassy should be obtained because the person is attached to the Embassy staff
or a question of diplomatic immunity may be involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) United States has an interest in the litigation. If the SJA determines that the United States has an interest in
the litigation, the commander may authorize the interview or order the individual's attendance in a temporary duty
status. The United States will be deemed to have an interest in the litigation if it is bound by treaty or other international
agreement to ensure the attendance of such personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) United States has no interest in the litigation. If the SJA determines that the United States does not have an interest
in the litigation, the commander may authorize the interview or the appearance of the witness under the principles
established in &sect;516.47 through &sect;516.50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Witnesses located outside the requester's country. If the requested witness is stationed in a country other than
the requester's, the matter will be referred to Litigation Division.

remedies in significant cases of fraud or corruption relating to Army procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The key elements of the Army's procurement fraud program follow: centralized policy making and program direction;
fraud remedies coordination; decentralized responsibility for operational matters, such as reporting and remedial
action; continuous case monitorship by PFD from the initial report until final disposition; and, command-wide fraud
awareness training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Remedies for PFI will be pursued in a timely manner and properly coordinated with other agencies. Every effort
will be made to support criminal investigation and prosecution of fraudulent activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A specific remedies plan will be formulated for each significant case of fraud or corruption involving procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Coordination on the status and disposition of cases will be maintained between PFD, OTJAG, PFI Coordinators at
MACOMs, and Procurement Fraud Advisers at subordinate commands. Coordination of procurement and personnel actions
will be accomplished with investigative agencies as required by those agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Training which relates to fraud and corruption in the procurement process is a significant element of this program.

Reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Typical fraud indicators during the procurement cycle are listed in Figure D&hyph;1, Appendix G, to this part.
The mere presence of one or more of these indicators does not, by itself, require reporting under paragraph b of this
section. Reports should be submitted if there is a reasonable suspicion of procurement fraud or irregularity or the
procuring agency refers the matter for investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ``Procurement Flash Reports'' will be transmitted by FAX directly to PFD whenever a PFI Coordinator or PFA receives
notice of a PFI involving the Army. To facilitate filing, a separate sheet should be used for each case reported. These
reports will provide a succinct summary of the following available information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name and address of contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Known subsidiaries of parent firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any of the above categories that cannot be completed will be annotated as ``unknown at present.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When a report is required by DFARS or is requested by PFD, the provisions of DFARS 209.406&hyph;3 (48 CFR 209.406&hyph;3)
will be followed. That paragraph provides the basic content and format for PFI reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All personnel will cooperate to ensure that investigations and prosecutions of procurement fraud are completed
in a timely and thorough manner. Requests for assistance from federal prosecutors should be processed through the
local PFA whenever possible. Requests for federal investigators will be processed through the supporting USACIDC
and the PFA will be notified. When the conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions conflict with the progress
of procurements, reasonable deference will be given to criminal investigators and prosecutors whenever possible.
Any serious conflict that cannot be resolved at a local level will be immediately reported to the PFI Coordinator or
PFD for action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) PFI Coordinators and PFAs may request access to information obtained during criminal investigations that is
not protected by Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and use this information to assist them in taking appropriate administrative,
contractual, and civil remedies. Requests for this information should be made directly to the appropriate federal
investigative agency. The investigative organization may withhold requested information if release would compromise
an investigation. Difficulties in obtaining information which cannot be resolved locally will be referred to PFD
for appropriate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) USACIDC will notify, in writing, local PFAs as well as PFD within 30 days, of initiation of a significant investigation
of fraud or corruption related to Army procurement activities. Such notification will include the following:

Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) PFCRA was enacted on 21 October 1986 (Public Law 99&hyph;509) and implemented by DOD on 30 August 1988 (DOD Directive
5505.5). (See Appendix E to this part.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) PFCRA expands the capability of the government to deter and recover losses from false, fictitious or fraudulent
claims and statements. It is also applicable to program fraud and provides an administrative remedy in addition to
those otherwise available to the Army in procurement fraud or pay and entitlements fraud cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As part of the Army implementation, the Secretary of the Army's duties and responsibilities under PFCRA as Authority
Head are delegated to the Army General Counsel. The Chief, Intellectual Property Law Division, is the Army's Reviewing
Official within the meaning of PFCRA. Army implementation also requires DA to follow the policies and procedures
prescribed in enclosure 2 of DOD Directive 5505.5. (See Appendix E to this part.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The DOD Inspector General (IG) is the Investigating Official within DOD. The duties of this position will be performed
by the Assistant IG For Investigations. This individual is vested with the authority to investigate all allegations
of liability under PFCRA. That authority includes the power to task subordinate investigative agencies to review
and report on allegations that are subject to PFCRA. If the Investigative Official concludes that an action under
PFCRA is warranted in an Army case, the official will submit a report containing the findings and conclusions of such
investigation through PFD to the Army Reviewing Official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Pursuant to DOD IG guidance, USACIDC will forward appropriate cases that appear to qualify for resolution under
PFCRA to the Investigating Official in a timely manner. Additionally, USACIDC will forward current information
regarding the status of remedies pending or concluded. USACIDC may obtain remedies information by coordinating
with PFD and the cognizant command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In pay and entitlement or transportation operation fraud cases, USACIDC will coordinate with the Office of the
Secretary of the Army, Financial Management, Review and Oversight Directorate (SAFM&hyph;RO), to determine the
status of any pending or proposed action under the Debt Collection Act. This information, in addition to information
obtained under &sect;517.68(e), will be forwarded with appropriate cases to the Investigating Official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In those cases where the Investigating Official has submitted a report to the Army Reviewing Official for action
under PFCRA, PFD will, at the direction of the Reviewing Official, prepare all legal memoranda as necessary to transmit
the Reviewing Official's intention to issue a complaint. As part of this responsibility PFD will do the following:
coordinate with the affected command or agency to ensure that all appropriate remedies have been considered; evaluate
the overall potential benefits to the Army; and, ensure that action under PFCRA is not duplicative of other remedies
already taken. In order to fully supplement the Reviewing Official's file, PFD may request a litigation report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) PFD will coordinate all cases involving transportation operations emanating from Military Traffic Management
Command (MTMC) activity, under the military transportation exception to the FAR, and all cases involving pay and
entitlements fraud with SAFM&hyph;RO, for comments and recommendations. These matters will be forwarded with the
case file to the Reviewing Official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the Attorney General approves the issuance of a complaint, PFD, at the direction of the Army Reviewing Official,
shall prepare the complaint and all necessary memoranda as required. PFD shall also designate attorneys to represent
the Authority in hearings under PFCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Labor Counselor will arrange for individual counsel for consultation from local assets. If local assets are
not sufficient, assistance may be requested from other DOD activities in the area or from HQDA, DAJA&hyph;LE. DA attorneys
tasked to consult with one or more witnesses individually will not be tasked to represent the DA activity concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Labor Counselor, as the legal representative of the activity, is precluded from assisting or representing
individual witnesses during OSC interviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ``Accused'' or ``suspected'' DA personnel and counsel for representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the OSC identifies a DA civilian employee or a military member as an ``accused'' or ``suspected'' individual,
or if the Labor Counselor concludes that an individual is a ``suspect,'' the Labor Counselor will inform the individual.
The Labor Counselor also will advise the individual of the availability of counsel for representation upon approval
by DA General Counsel. (See Glossary, Counsel for Representation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the ``suspected'' individual desires legal representation by DA, the individual must request counsel by submitting
a written request through DAJA&hyph;LE to DA General Counsel. (See Figure I&hyph;1, Appendix G, to this part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the investigation but prior to DA General Counsel approval of the request for counsel, an ``accused'' or
``suspected'' individual will be provided the assistance of counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other
OSC requested witness. ``Accused'' or ``suspected'' individuals who do not request counsel for representation
will be provided counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other OSC requested witness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) If the DA General Counsel approves the request for counsel, the Chief, DAJA-LE, will appoint a DA attorney to represent
the individual. This appointment may be made telephonically but will be confirmed in writing. The Chief, DAJA-LE,
will make appropriate coordination with MACOM SJAs and command counsel to confirm availability of the attorney.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An attorney appointed by DA may represent a civilian employee in any proceeding initiated by OSC before the MSPB.
However, counsel provided by DA may not represent the employee in any proceeding initiated by DA, in any appeal from
a final decision by the MSPB, or in any collateral proceeding before any forum other than the MSPB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) OSC may not bring a disciplinary action before the MSPB against a military member. Accordingly, DA counsel will
not be required to represent the military member in any MSPB disciplinary proceeding. However, counsel may represent
the member during the OSC investigation with the understanding that the evidence obtained by OSC may be referred to
the member's command for possible disciplinary action under the UCMJ or appropriate regulations. If DA initiates
action against the military member for misconduct disclosed in the OSC investigation, the member will obtain counsel
as provided under the UCMJ or relevant regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) OSC requests for records must be in writing. The Labor Counselor will assist OSC representatives in identifying
the custodian of specific records sought during the inquiry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Generally, requested records should be furnished to OSC representatives if such records would be released under
AR 25&hyph;55 or AR 340&hyph;21 to other government agencies in the normal course of official business. Records constituting
attorney work product should not be released without approval of the Chief, DAJA-LE. IG records will not be released
without the approval of the Inspector General. (AR 20&hyph;1). The Labor Counselor should seek guidance from the
Chief, DAJA-LE, if there is any doubt concerning the release of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If, after completion of the OSC investigation, the OSC files a complaint against DA or a DA employee, release of
records and other information will be accomplished pursuant to MSPB rules of discovery (5 CFR part 1201, subpart B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Funding. The command, activity, or installation within which the allegations of misconduct arose will provide
funding for travel, per diem and other necessary expenses related to the OSC investigation. These expenses may include
appropriate funding for witnesses, counsel for consultation and DA General Counsel approved counsel for representation.

Exemption determination authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The commander exercising special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) over a unit has the authority to
determine whether a soldier of that unit, who has been served with a summons, is exempt from serving on a state or local
jury unless that authority has been limited or withheld in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This
authority may not be delegated to a subordinate commander who does not exercise SPCMCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A commander superior to the SPCMCA, who also exercises SPCMCA or general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA)
over a unit, may limit or withhold the exemption determination authority of subordinate commanders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A GCMCA, who orders a unit or soldier assigned to one command to be attached or detailed to another command for disciplinary
purposes (for example, ``for administration'' or ``for administration of military justice''), may reserve exemption
determination authority to the commander exercising SPCMCA in the chain of command to which the unit or soldier is
assigned rather than the chain of command to which the unit or soldier is attached or detailed.

Procedures for exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Active duty soldiers served with a summons to serve on a state or local jury will promptly advise their commander
and provide copies of pertinent documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unit commanders will evaluate the summons considering both the individual soldier's duties and the unit mission.
Coordination with the servicing judge advocate or legal adviser and with the appropriate state or local official
may be necessary to determine any impact on the soldier's duties or on unit readiness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the soldier is not exempt under &sect;516.75 (b) or (c), the commander will process the soldier for permissive
TDY in accordance with AR 630&hyph;5, Leaves and Passes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the soldier is exempt under &sect;516.75 (b) or (c), the commander will forward the summons and any related documentation,
with recommendations, through the chain of command to the commander with exemption determination authority over
the soldier concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The commander with exemption determination authority over the soldier concerned will determine whether the
soldier is exempt. His determination is final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The exemption determination authority will notify responsible state or local officials whenever a soldier summoned
for jury duty is exempt. The notification will cite 10 U.S.C. 982 as authority.

(a) Soldiers who are required to comply with summons to serve on state or local juries will be placed on permissive TDY
under the provisions of AR 630&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Jury fees accruing to soldiers for complying with the summons to serve on state and local juries must be turned over
to the appropriate finance office for deposit into the U.S. Treasury. Commands will establish procedures with local
authorities and their servicing finance and accounting activity to ensure that such jury fees are so deposited. Soldiers,
however, may keep any reimbursement from state or local authority for expenses incurred in the performance of jury
duty, including transportation, meals, and parking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
l. The General Counsel, Department of Defense (GC, DoD), shall provide general policy and procedural guidance by

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Authority to Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a. In response to a litigation request or demand for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses,
the General Counsels of DoD, Navy, and the Defense Agencies; the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments;
and the Chief Legal Advisors to the JCS and the Unified and Specified Commands, with regard to their respective Components,
are authorized_after consulting and coordinating with the appropriate Department of Justice litigation attorneys,
as required_to determine whether official information originated by the Component may be released in litigation;
whether DoD personnel assigned to or affiliated with the Component may be interviewed, contacted, or used as witnesses
concerning official DoD information or as expert witnesses; and what, if any, conditions will be imposed upon such
release, interview, contact, or testimony. Delegation of this authority, to include the authority to invoke appropriate
claims of privilege before any tribunal, is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In the event that a DoD Component receives a litigation request or demand for official information originated by
another Component, the receiving Component shall forward the appropriate portions of the request or demand to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Factors to Consider
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In deciding whether to authorize the release of official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel concerning
official information (hereinafter referred to as ``the disclosure'') pursuant to paragraph F.1., DoD officials
should consider the following types of factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the
case or matter in which the request or demand arose; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Whether the disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive
law concerning privilege; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Whether the disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information
properly classified pursuant to the DoD Information Security Program under DoD 5200.1&hyph;R (reference (d)),
unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25 (reference (e)), or
other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Whether disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights,
reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential
commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Decisions on Litigation Requests and Demands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel shall not, in response to a litigation request or demand, produce, disclose,
release, comment upon, or testify concerning any official DoD information without the prior written approval of
the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. Oral approval may be granted, but a record of such approval
shall be made and retained in accordance with the applicable implementing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. If official DoD information is sought, through testimony or otherwise, by a litigation request or demand, the individual
seeking such release or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much specificity as possible, the nature and
relevance of the official information sought. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel may only produce, disclose,
release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters that were specified in writing and properly approved
by the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462
(1951). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Whenever a litigation request or demand is made upon DoD personnel for official DoD information or for testimony
concerning such information, the personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall immediately notify the
DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. for the Component to which the individual contacted is or, for former personnel,
was last assigned. In appropriate cases, the responsible DoD official shall thereupon notify the Department of Justice
of the request or demands. After due consultation and coordination with the Department of Justice, as required, the
DoD official shall determine whether the individual is required to comply with the request or demand and shall notify
the requestor or the court or other authority of the determination reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. If, after DoD personnel have received a litigation request or demand and have in turn notified the appropriate DoD
official in accordance with paragraph F.3.c., a response to the request or demand is required before instructions
from the responsible official are received, the responsible official designated in paragraph F.1. shall furnish
the requestor or the court or other authority with a copy of this Directive and applicable implementing regulations,
inform the requestor or the court or other authority that the request or demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of
the request or demand pending a final determination by the Component concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority declines to stay the effect of the request or
demand in response to action taken pursuant to paragraph F.3.d., or if such court or other authority orders that the
request or demand must be complied with notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate DoD official, the DoD
personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall notify the responsible DoD official of such ruling or order.
If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's ruling or order will be sought,
the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the request, demand, or order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official,
however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel.

4. Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the guidelines in DoD Instruction 7230.7 (reference (f)), the appropriate officials designated
in paragraph F.1. are authorized to charge reasonable fees, as established by regulation and to the extent not prohibited
by law, to parties seeking, by request or demand, official DoD information not otherwise available under the DoD Freedom
of Information Act Program (reference (g)). Such fees, in amounts calculated to reimburse the Government for the
expense of providing such information, may include the costs of time expended by DoD employees to process and respond
to the request or demand; attorney time for reviewing the request or demand and any information located in response
thereto and for related legal work in connection with the request or demand; and expenses generated by materials and
equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders,
437 U.S. 340 (1978). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Expert or Opinion Testimony 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
DoD personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official
DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department
of Justice. Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony
will not be adverse to the interests of the Department of Defense or the United States, the appropriate DoD official
designated in paragraph F.1. may, in writing, grant special authorization for DoD personnel to appear and testify
at no expense to the United States. If, despite the final determination of the responsible DoD official, a court of
competent jurisdiction, or other appropriate authority, orders the appearance and expert or opinion testimony
of DoD personnel, the personnel shall notify the responsible DoD official of such order. If the DoD official determines
that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply
with the order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully
decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is DoD policy that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each of the DoD Components shall monitor, from its inception, all significant investigations of fraud or corruption
related to procurement activities affecting its organizations, for the purpose of ensuring that all possible criminal,
civil, administrative, and contractual remedies in such cases are identified to cognizant procurement and command
officials and that appropriate remedies are pursued expeditiously. This process shall include appropriate coordination
with all other affected DoD Components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities shall be reviewed to determine and
implement the appropriate contractual and administrative actions that are necessary to recover funds lost through
fraud or corruption and to ensure the integrity of DoD programs and operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Appropriate civil, contractual, and administrative actions, including those set forth in enclosure 1, shall
be taken expeditiously. During an investigation and before prosecution or litigation, and when based in whole or
in part on evidence developed during an investigation, such actions shall be taken with the advance knowledge of the
responsible DoD criminal investigative organization and, when necessary, the appropriate legal counsel in the
Department of Defense and the Department of Justice (DoJ). When appropriate, such actions shall be taken before final
resolution of the criminal or civil case.

To overcome Federal statutory restrictions on the disclosure of the requested file imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.
&sect;552a, you must provide either a written release authorization signed by the individual to whom the file pertains
(that is, SSG Kramer) or a court ordered release signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. A subpoena signed
by a clerk of court, notary, or other official is insufficient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, because of the attorney-client relationship between Captain Selby and SSG Kramer, you must produce
a written waiver of the attorney-client privilege from SSG Kramer. Because the privilege may protect both documents
and testimony, Captain Selby may not divulge such information without SSG Kramer's consent.

In addition to the above requirements, Captain Selby's supervisor must approve her absence from duty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 32 CFR &sect;516.43. In this regard, we suggest you take the deposition at Fort Smith. In any event, however, you or
your client must pay all travel expenses, as this is purely private litigation and witness' appearance must be at no

Finally, if Captain Selby does appear as a witness, she may only give factual testimony. She may not testify as an opinion

employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to the following conditions, your request is approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This grant of authority is limited to factual testimony only. Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness.
This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private
litigation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 32 CFR &sect;516.42. Captain Sawyer may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise
protected from public disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization
is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because
this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States.

Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request for Mr. Charles Montrose to appear as an expert witness in private litigation:
Smithers 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
ABC Video.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the following reasons, the request is denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Army Regulation 27&hyph;40 forbids Army personnel from providing expert testimony in private litigation, with
or without compensation, except under the most extraordinary circumstances. See 32 CFR &sect;&sect;97.6(e), 516.42.
Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest,
or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies,
a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers
to the contrary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with
matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private
litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal
taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance
of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such
conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony.
You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The
expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception
to the Army's policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500.

Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request to depose Dr. (MAJ) J. McDonald, Fort Smith Medical Treatment Facility.
Pursuant to 32 CFR &sect;&sect;516.33&hyph;516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted,
or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the
treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries
suffered, or contemplated future treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an ``expert.'' This
limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and
Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects,
or activities in private litigation. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 32 CFR &sect;&sect;97.6(e), 516.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from
public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the
depositions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived
from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge. A subpoena
issued by someone other than a judge or magistrate is insufficient.

e. Mandatory stock levels and inventory requirements appear excessive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Items appear to be unnecessarily declared excess or sold as surplus, while same items are being reprocured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. It appears that an item or service is being purchased more as a result of aggressive marketing efforts rather than
in response to a valid requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Need determination appears to be unnecessarily tailored in ways that can only be met by certain contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Items and services are continually obtained from the same source due to an unwarranted lack of effort to develop
second sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. During the development of the statements of work and specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Statements of work and specifications appear to be intentionally written to fit the products or capabilities of
a single contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Statements of work, specifications, or sole source justifications developed by or in consultation with a preferred
contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Information concerning requirements and pending contracts is released only to preferred contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Allowing companies and industry personnel who participated in the preparation of bid packages to perform on subsequent
contracts in either a prime or subcontractor capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Release of information by firms or personnel participating in design or engineering to companies competing for
prime contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Prequalification standards or specifications appear designed to exclude otherwise qualified contractors or
their productions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Requirements appear split up to allow for rotating bids, giving each contractor his or her ``fair share.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Requirements appear split up to meet small purchase requirements (that is, $25,000) or to avoid higher levels of
approval that would be otherwise required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Bid specifications or statement of work appear inconsistent with the items described in the general requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Specifications appear so vague that reasonable comparisons of estimate would be difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Specifications appear inconsistent with previous procurements of similar items of services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. During the presolicitation phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Sole source justifications appear unnecessary or poorly supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Statements justifying sole source or negotiated procurements appear inadequate or incredible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Solicitation documents appear to contain unnecessary requirements which tend to restrict competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Contractors or their representatives appear to have received advanced information related to the proposed procurement
on a preferential basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. During the solicitation phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Procurement appears to be processed so as to exclude or impede certain contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The time for submission of bids appears to be unnecessarily limited so that only those with advance information
have adequate time to prepare bids or proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. It appears that information concerning the procurement has been revealed only to certain contractors, without
being revealed to all prospective competitors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Bidders conferences are conducted in a way that apparently invites bid rigging, price fixing, or other improper
collusion between contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. There is an apparent intentional failure to fairly publish notice of the solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Solicitation appears vague as to the details such as time, place and manner, of submitting acceptable bids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. There is evidence of improper communications or social contract between contractors and government personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Controls over the number and destination of bid packages sent to interested bidders appear inadequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Indications that government personnel or their families may own stock or have some other financial interest in
either a contractor or subcontractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Indications that government personnel are discussing possible employment for themselves or a family member with
a contractor or subcontractor or indications that a proposal for future employment from a contractor or subcontractor
to a government employee or his or her family members has not been firmly rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Testing Defective Items Under Criminal or Civil Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Under no circumstances is testing to proceed unless the command has committed sufficient funding to cover the entire
cost of the projected testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. No testing will be initiated unless there has been a written request for the testing to the appropriate Procurement
Fraud Advisor from a criminal investigator or Assistant United States Attorney or Department of Justice Attorney
(AUSA is used in these procedures to indicate either an AUSA or Department of Justice attorney). If they have not already
done so, criminal investigators should be requested to coordinate their testing requests with the AUSA overseeing
the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Barring extraordinary circumstances, only one test will be conducted to support the criminal and civil recovery
efforts of a procurement fraud/irregularity matter. Early coordination with the Civil Division of Department of
Justice or the local United States Attorneys Office is necessary to ensure that testing funds are not wasted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The request for testing should include a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the testing to include a statement
of the allegations made and the contact number(s) involved. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Any test plan which requires destructive testing must be approved by the AUSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. No testing will be initiated unless a test plan has been developed which states the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 -->
a. the contract number(s) involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to be tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. the purpose of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. the alleged defect or the contractual requirement violated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. the CID report of investigation (ROI) number or the DCIS case number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. cost of the test (a cost proposal should be an attachment to the test plan) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. where the test will be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. how the test will be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. the name and telephone number of the test team leader 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. the names of all test team members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. the approximate dates of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. the date that completion of the test is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. a clear statement of the desired product (that is test report, raw data, analysis of results, evaluation of test
results) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n. the PRON to fund the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o. a retention plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
6. The test plan shall be coordinated with the concurrence received in advance from the appropriate personnel in the
Procurement Directorate, Product Assurance and Test Directorate, the Procurement Fraud Advisor, and the investigator/AUSA
requesting the test. No testing will be initiated until the criminal investigator/AUSA who requested the testing
has approved the test plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If the items tested are to be retained as evidence, the criminal investigator should arrange for retention of the
evidence. While the Command will support evidence retention, this is primarily the responsibility of the criminal
investigators. Agents should be advised that putting items in Code L or similar non-use status is insufficient to
protect it from being released to the field. A decision not to retain the tested items as evidence must have the approval
of the AUSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. All items to be tested should be from a statistically valid random sample. The sample should conform with the inspection
requirements of the contract or be in conformance with a random sample specifically developed for the instant test
plan. It is recommended that a statistician be consulted to determine the feasibility of a random sample specifically
created to support the test plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Results of testing should be available to Command and DA personnel for appropriate contractual and administrative
remedies. Any request for testing results that indicates that dissemination of the testing results will be limited
by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be forwarded through the MACOM or AMC Procurement Fraud
Coordinator to DA Procurement Fraud Division prior to the initiation of any testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Resolution of problems associated with testing requests should be conducted at the local level. In AMC the authority
to refuse a testing request resides with the Office of Command Counsel. Any disputes which cannot be resolved at the
local level will be forwarded to the AMC or MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator for resolution. This includes disputes
regarding funding or any time sensitive issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Second requests for testing of the same item due to a change in the investigative plan require coordination by the
PFA with the investigator and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 AUSA overseeing the investigation to determine the deficiencies in the earlier test. Disputes which cannot be resolved
between the AUSA, PFA, and investigator regarding testing are to be forwarded simultaneously to the MACOM Procurement
Fraud Coordinator and PFD for resolution. The procedures established in paragraphs 5 and 6 apply for second requests
for testing with the additional requirement that the Assistant United States Attorney must be requested to approve
the test plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation Before Office of Special Counsel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. DA employees or military members asked to provide information (testimonial or documentary) to OSC may obtain legal
advice through the Labor Counselor from DA attorneys concerning their rights and obligations. This includes assistance
at any interviews with OSC investigators. However, an attorney-client relationship will not be established unless
the employee or military member_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has been assigned counsel by the DA General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Any military member or employee who reasonably believes that he or she is suspected or has been accused by OSC of committing
a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from DA. The counsel
assigned will be from another DOD component whenever a DA attorney is likely to face a conflict between the attorney's
ethical obligation to the client and DA, or when the suspected or accused individual has requested representation
from another DOD component. Outside legal counsel may be retained by DA on behalf of the member or employee under unusual
circumstances and only with the personal approval of the DOD General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The DA General Counsel will determine whether a conflict is likely to occur if a DA attorney is assigned to represent
a military member or civilian. If the DA General Counsel determines a conflict may occur, or if the suspected or accused
employee has requested representation from another DOD component, the DA General Counsel will seek the assistance
of another General Counsel in obtaining representation outside DA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requests for Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. To obtain legal representation, military members or civilian employees must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Submit a written request for legal representation through the Labor and Employment Law Office, Office of the Judge
Advocate General, Department of the Army, to DA General Counsel, explaining the circumstances that justify legal
representation. Copies of all process and pleadings served should accompany the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Indicate whether private counsel, at personal expense, has been retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Obtain written certification from their supervisor that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) They were acting within the scope of official duties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) DA has not initiated any adverse or disciplinary action against them for the conduct being investigated by the
OSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Requests for DA legal representation must be approved by the DA General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The conditions of legal representation must be explained and accepted in writing by the member or employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Limitations on Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. DA will not provide legal representation with respect to a DA initiated disciplinary action against a civilian
employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in illegal or improper
conduct. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary
action proposed by the OSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In certain situations, counsel provided by DA may be limited to representing the individual only with respect to
some of the pending matters, if other specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the requirements
contained in this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Attorney-Client Relationship
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. An attorney-client relationship will be established and continued between the suspected or accused individual
and assigned DA counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In representing a DA employee or military member, the DA attorney designated as counsel will act as a vigorous advocate
of the individual's legal interests before the OSC or MSPB. The attorney's professional responsibility to DA will
be satisfied by fulfilling this responsibility to the employee or military member. Legal representation may be terminated
only with the approval of the DA General Counsel and normally only on the basis of information not available at the time
the attorney was assigned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the assigned DA counsel determines, with the approval of
the DA General Counsel, that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The military member or civilian employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official duties when engaging
in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC investigation or charge; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Termination is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The DA attorney designated as counsel may request relief from the duties of representation or counseling without
being required to furnish explanatory information that might compromise confidential communications between
the client and the attorney. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation authorizes cognizant DA officials to approve requests from military members or civilian employees
for travel, per diem, witness appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective legal representation
by the designated counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A military member's or civilian employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB hearings, and other related
proceedings will be considered official departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar
purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Advice to Witnesses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following advice to military members and civilian employees questioned during the course of an OSC investigation
may be appropriate in response to these frequent inquiries:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A witness may decline to provide a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer in favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary
to ensure accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are appropriate to avoid misinterpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Means to ensure verifications of an interview by OSC investigators are appropriate, whether or not the military
member or civilian employee is accompanied by counsel. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recorder is used in full view.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All attendees are informed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OSC investigator agrees to record the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview prepared by the investigator should be corrected before
the member or employee signs the statement. The military member or civilian employee is not required to sign any written
summary that is not completely accurate. A military member or civilian employee may receive a copy of the summary as
a condition of signing.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Labor is issuing these regulations pursuant to the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A&hyph;110 (Revised), which provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. This rule also applies to the Department of Labor's grants to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments and international organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and, except for a minor revision in February 1987, the Circular remained unchanged
until revised in 1993. To update the Circular, OMB established an interagency task force to review the Circular. The
task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular from university groups, non-profit organizations
and other interested parties and compared for consistency the provisions of similar provisions applied to State
and local governments. The revised Circular and these regulations reflect the results of these efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 39018) on August 27, 1992, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Interested
parties were invited to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations,
professional organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing this final revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62992, OMB published a notice containing its final revision to Circular A&hyph;110.
In that publication, OMB presented a summary of the major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment.
Other changes were made to increase clarity and readability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Omitted from part 95 are requirements which DOL must meet pursuant to the Circular. Those requirements deal with the
relationship between DOL and OMB and are not necessary to this rulemaking. OMB Circular A&hyph;110 gives Federal
agencies the discretion to make these regulations applicable to grants and agreements awarded to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments, and international organizations.
The Department of Labor has chosen to do so. As permitted by OMB Circular A&hyph;110, the Department has made a few changes
to the language of the Circular to fit the particular circumstances of the DOL programs. The Department has added a
definition of ``commercial organizations'' and revised the definition of ``program income'' for clarification
purposes. The Department also has revised the language in &sect;95.25(e)(2), dealing with extensions, for editorial
purposes. The Department has deleted the words ``at least'' from &sect;95.22(e)(2) to enhance administrative efficiency
by limiting invoicing to once a month. Other minor editorial, technical, and clarifying changes are made as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Publication in Final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Labor has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that good cause exists for waiving public
comment on this procedural amendment to the regulation because such comment is unnecessary, impracticable, and
contrary to the public interest. This finding is made because all executive agencies are required to follow OMB directives
with respect to grants or assistance of property. See 41 U.S.C. &sect;405 (The Office of Federal Procurement Policy
Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that good cause exists for waiving the customary requirement for delay in the effective
date of a final rule for 30 days following its publication. Therefore, this rule shall be effective July 27, 1994. See
5 U.S.C. 553. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Procedural Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Since this
rule was not preceded by a proposed rule, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Further,
the Department of Labor certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but, rather, modifies
and updates administrative and procedural requirements. The recordkeeping requirements in this rule have been
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 1225&hyph;0017.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205), declares that
the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. DOL shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage
in Federal Government Programs.''

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State
agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section
6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products
containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
(40 CFR parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit
organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement
programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in &sect;95.52. Though DOL requires reporting on an accrual
basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required
to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis
of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, DOL, at its
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient
are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) DOL may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business

State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and

Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special DOL instructions
for electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DOL
may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished
through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, DOL shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless
the billing is improper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement monthly when electronic funds transfers are
not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOL has determined that reimbursement is not feasible
because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOL may provide cash on a working capital advance basis.
Under this procedure, DOL shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial
period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOL shall reimburse the recipient for its
actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling
or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOL shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at
any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, DOL may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOL shall not require separate depository
accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds
provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1),
(k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR Part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment
Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients who do not have this
capability should use a check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest.
If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written
approval from DOL, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. DOL shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The SF&hyph;270 is the standard form for all nonconstruction
programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. DOL, however, has the option
of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement
for Construction Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The SF&hyph;271 is the
standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, DOL may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
substitute
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the SF&hyph;270 when DOL determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federally-assisted project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with prior written approval
of the grant officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If DOL authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of the
value determined under paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the grant officer may approve
the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of
donation to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the grant officer has approved the charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees.

(5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The inclusion, unless waived by the grant officer, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB
Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A 122, ``Cost Principles
for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to
Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles

OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, the grant officer may waive cost-related
and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such
waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior written approval

anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the grant officer in writing with the supporting

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) DOL may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and
activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such
transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOL. DOL shall not permit
a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent
with the original intent of the appropriation.

the recipient to request prior written approval before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients shall notify the grant officer in writing promptly
whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period
by more than $5,000 or five percent of the award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an
application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) When requesting written approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in
the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the grant officer shall review

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with

Sections 95.31 through 95.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished
by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Recipients are required
to observe these standards under awards and no additional requirements shall be imposed, unless specifically required
by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes
the provisions of &sect;&sect;95.31 through 95.37.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOL shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in
whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain prior written approval from the grant officer for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored
projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project.
Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that
have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the grant officer. The grant officer shall issue one or more of the following
disposition instructions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by DOL and pay DOL for that percentage
of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting
actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized
or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the
extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to DOL. Upon completion of the award or when the
property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to DOL for further Federal agency utilization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) If DOL has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless DOL has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exempt property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When statutory authority exists, DOL has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOL considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should DOL not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the
equipment in connection with its other federally, sponsored activities, in the following order of priority: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by the DOL agency which funded the original project, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the DOL agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to
projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the grant officer.
User charges shall be treated as program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the written approval of
the grant officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A description of the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the grant officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original DOL agency. The amount of
compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project
or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient
shall request disposition instructions from DOL. The DOL agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used
to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within the DOL agency, the availability of the equipment
shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOL to determine whether a requirement for the equipment
exists in other Federal agencies. DOL shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after
the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOL an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall
be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for
the recipient's selling and handling expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the
awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The DOL agency reserves the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the
Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject
to the following standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The DOL agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory.
The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOL fails
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of
this section, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When DOL exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned
equipment.

in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient
shall not encumber the property without written approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the originally
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of &sect;95.34(g).

Purpose of procurement standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 95.41 through 95.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by DOL upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or approved by OMB.

Recipient responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOL, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

Codes of conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

Competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid
or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest
to do so.

(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients shall avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the
most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services shall provide for all of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration,
the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency, and DOL's Office of Small Business and Minority
Affairs in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.'s
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' See 29 CFR part 98. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available to DOL, pre-award and procurement documents, such as request for
proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

Contract provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, DOL may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided DOL has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, DOL, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) DOL shall prescribe the frequency with which performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph
(f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently
than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports
shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOL may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year
awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOL of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) DOL may make site visits, as needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Recipients shall use the SF&hyph;269, SF&hyph;269A, or other OMB-approved forms to report the status of funds
for all nonconstruction projects or programs. DOL may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269
or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash
Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or
SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) DOL shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or an accrual basis. If DOL requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not convert
its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of
the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) DOL shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients, the recipient shall submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary, its continuation
sheet, SF&hyph;272a. DOL shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement
information for each agreement with the recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) DOL may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOL may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions
taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar days following
the end of each quarter. The DOL agency may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling
$1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) DOL may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in DOL's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances;
or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When DOL needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOL shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When DOL determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in &sect;95.21, additional
pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time
as the system is brought up to standard. DOL, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements
of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) DOL may shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.

(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by DOL. The only exceptions are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOL, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the
recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) DOL shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, DOL may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Federal grantor awarding agency, the Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or
any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents,
papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, DOL shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOL can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. &sect;552) if the
records had belonged to DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply
to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals,
cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to DOL or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the
proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period
for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to DOL or the subrecipient is not required
to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention
period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year
(or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless DOL expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule clarifies, updates and modifies existing regulations on the management of cabins on national wildlife
refuges (refuges) in Alaska. These regulations are necessary in order to comply with the National Wildlife Refuge
System Administration Act of 1966 and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) concerning
the administration of cabins on Alaska refuges. These regulations are being revised to ensure proper and uniform
management of all cabins on national wildlife refuges in Alaska. In addition, a technical amendment is made to eliminate
reference to sections regarding general provisions which have been removed earlier.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1303 and 1315 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3193 and 3203) allow the Secretary of the Interior to permit cabins on refuges
in Alaska under certain conditions. Section 304 of ANILCA reemphasizes the authority of the Secretary to prescribe
such regulations as necessary to ensure the compatibility of uses with refuge purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original cabin policy for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was developed in 1981 and revised in 1984.
This policy was the basis for regulations printed in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 50. In September 1987, the
Service, believing revisions of the existing cabin policy and regulations were needed, published a Draft Cabin Management
Policy for Cabins on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. The purpose of the cabin policy is to provide uniform guidance
to both the public and refuge managers on human use and occupancy of cabins located on refuges in Alaska. The policy
further serves to define under what conditions use and occupancy of a cabin may be compatible with the purposes for
which the refuge was established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and suggestions on the draft policy were solicited during a 60-day public review period. The Service made
extensive revisions in response to the comments. Because of the number and nature of revisions made, the Service published
a revised draft of the policy in December 1988 to give the public another opportunity to comment before the policy was
made final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised draft was completely reorganized. It better described the objectives of the policy and set forth the guidelines
needed to comply with ANILCA and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The comment period
for the revised draft was also 60 days. The final cabin policy was issued in August, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in the process was to publish proposed rules to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the
rulemaking process and solicit public comment. A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 25, 1991 (56 FR 19074). The proposed rule had a 60 day public comment period and public hearings were held in
Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the proposed and the final rules contain significantly more guidance relating to cabin management than existing
regulations. However, only minor changes are made in permit application procedures. The existing requirement that
individuals apply for nontransferable renewable five year special use permits is retained. However, this final
rule requires two additional items (date of construction or acquisition of the cabin and the dimensions of the cabin
and related structures) to be submitted in the application. In addition to the increased application requirements,
the rule has additional requirements of permittees such as getting permission from the refuge manager before major
modification or rehabilitation is conducted on existing cabins.

Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four persons presented oral comments at the public hearings and the Service received an additional eight letters
providing written comments from the public. A number of changes were made in the final rule from the proposed rule after
consideration of all public comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments requested changes that were 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
made, however, and the Service first addresses these comments as noted below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Exemptions for Certain Types of Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations should exempt facilities such as headquarters sites, visitor centers, and state facilities used
to support fish and wildlife related management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Service's position that cabins used by the State for support of fish and wildlife related management are administrative
cabins and should not be exempted from the regulations. Visitor centers and headquarters sites do not need to be exempted
since they are not within the scope of the cabin regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final cabin regulations should address rights of access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service does not believe it is necessary to repeat such language in the cabin regulations since the intent of ANILCA
Section 1110(a) regarding access is already articulated in 50 CFR 36.12 and 43 CFR Part 36. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Definition of Family and Immediate Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``family'' should be broadened and the definition of ``immediate family'' should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions, as proposed, fully meet the intent of ANILCA Section 1303(c)(1) regarding permit renewal for the
life of claimants and immediate family. The definition of ``immediate family'' was broadened by deleting ``legal''
from the term ``legal spouse.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Public Use of Seasonally Permitted Cabins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``public use cabin'' should be revised to allow seasonally permitted cabins to also be used as public
use cabins during the other parts of the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service does not have the authority to allow use of ``existing'' cabins which are privately owned. Although ``new''
cabins are government property, the permittees usually have a considerable amount of private property in and around
the cabin. The Service does not believe it is reasonable to make the permittees' private belongings accessible to
the public or require the permittees to seasonally remove all of their property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) Permits for New Cabins Generally Only for Subsistence Purposes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language ``In general, new cabin permits will be given only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence
activity[.]'' should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This statement meets the intent of ANILCA and the Service believes it is appropriate to include in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) Construction and Use of Cabins in Wilderness Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language which only allows new cabins to be constructed in wilderness areas that are built specifically for the
administration of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary
use should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language as proposed meets the intent of the Wilderness Act, as well as ANILCA, and is appropriate to include in
the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) Guests in Cabins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was some objection to the requirement that guests occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee are required
to obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unauthorized use and vandalism of permitted cabins has been a problem in the past. The Service believes this is a reasonable
requirement to reduce the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) Recreational Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended revising the language ``No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin
for private recreational use or for the private recreational use of an existing cabin'' in order to comply with a recent
court case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language as proposed does comply with the decision of the court. The case simply made it clear that permittees and
their guests have the right to recreate while occupying cabins for which permits were issued for purposes other than
recreation.

(i) Nontransferable Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It was recommended that permits for existing cabins be transferable to another person at the election or death of the
original permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nontransferability is a condition of all Service special use permits, regardless of the use being authorized. The
requirement is consistent with ANILCA and is appropriate to be included in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(j) Compatibility Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The criteria for determining cabin compatibility should be included in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Compatibility determinations are site specific and relate directly to the specific purposes for which each refuge
was established. The 16 refuges established/redesignated by ANILCA have different purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(k) Relationship of Proposed Regulations With Policy

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intent, clarifications, and directions in the Service's cabin policy should be included in the regulations or
be adopted by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service's cabin policy was widely distributed to the public and is available by request to all interested parties.
Some of the information in the policy is of a subjective nature which is not appropriate for regulations. All elements
of the Service's cabin policy that were determined to be appropriate as regulatory language were included in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(l) Environmental Protection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Language should be included that recognizes there are other Federal and State regulations governing environmental
compliance with activities associated with cabins (e.g., disposal of sewage and solid waste, drinking water, fuel
storage, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Standard conditions of all special use permits issued by the Service require the permittees to follow other applicable
State and Federal regulations. Therefore, the inclusion of regulatory language referencing other applicable regulations
is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(m) Late Application for Existing Cabins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirement that claimants who fail to meet application deadlines for ``existing'' cabins (within one year from
the date these regulations are published) will only be allowed to apply for ``new'' cabins, no matter when the cabin
was built or first used should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations provide a one year application period following the effective date of the regulations. The Service
believes that the deadline is reasonable since regulations requiring the permits have been in place since 1981 and
considerable time and effort has been expended in notifying cabin occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(n) Other Related Structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of ``other related structures'' should be revised to clarify that the term only includes those structures
in the vicinity and directly related to the operation of a cabin. The commenter also requested clarification that
temporary facilities may also occur under other regulations unrelated to the cabin regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service believes that the context of the definition makes it clear that the other related structures only include
those associated with cabins. A statement that temporary facilities may be authorized under other regulations is
irrelevant to the cabin regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We appreciate these comments; however, as noted, the Service did not make substantive changes to reflect such requests
for revisions for the reasons stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a section by section analysis of all substantive changes that the Service made in the final rule.

A provision was included in paragraph (1) regarding the privileges and rights of existing cabin users in response
to one comment. The period for applications for permits for existing cabins which are not currently under a valid permit
was revised from 90 days to one year following the effective date of these regulations. This was done in response to
two comments. Vandalism was included in paragraph (5) as a cause to reconstruct existing cabins in response to one
comment.

Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of these regulations on subsistence uses has been evaluated as required by Section 810 of ANILCA. Subsistence
use and access are expected to differ little from existing use. The regulations are consistent with the purposes and
intent of Section 810 and will result in no significant restrictions on subsistence activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properly regulated and managed cabin use is consistent with the purposes for which the various refuges in Alaska were
established.

National Environmental Policy Act Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgation of these cabin management regulations would generally maintain the status quo existing under the
current rules. Additionally, changes in environmental effects would be negligible. Therefore the implementation
of regulations relative to cabin management on refuges in Alaska is determined to be a categorical exclusion as detailed
in the Department of Interior Manual (516 DM 6, Appendix 1). An Environmental Action Memorandum documenting this
decision was signed on June 7, 1990.

Economic Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. A review under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small
entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This rulemaking would have
no significant effect on such entities as, in most cases, this merely continues pre-existing uses of public lands.

All cabins.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in this paragraph (b) shall apply to all cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. The regulations
in this paragraph (b) do not apply to temporary facilities: any structure or man-made improvement which can readily
be completely dismantled and removed from the site when the period of authorized use is terminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A special use permit is required to construct, use and/or occupy a cabin on Fish and Wildlife Service lands within
the refuge. The permit may also authorize the use of related structures and other necessary appurtenances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After adequate public notice has been given, unclaimed cabins become the property of the Federal Government.
Adequate public notice shall include: Posting notices of trespass on unclaimed cabins; publication of notices of
trespass in Anchorage and Fairbanks newspapers and in at least one local newspaper if available; and posting notices
of trespass at appropriate community post offices. A Government-owned cabin may be used for refuge administration,
used for emergency purposes by the public, permitted to another applicant, designated a public use cabin, or destroyed.
Disposal of excess cabins and structures will be according to regulations pursuant to Title 41, Chapter 114 of the
Code of Federal Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Willful noncompliance with the conditions and stipulations of a special use permit shall be considered grounds
to invoke the administrative process leading to notice and hearing, and possible revocation of the permit. The refuge
manager will attempt to resolve problems of noncompliance with the permittee as soon as possible after the situation
becomes known. If this effort fails, the refuge manager shall provide written notice to the permittee within 30 days
of that date, informing the permittee of noncompliance, giving specific instructions for compliance and providing
appropriate time for the permittee to comply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin for private recreational use or for the private
recreational use of an existing cabin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Guests are allowed to occupy a cabin only during the activity period identified on the special use permit. Guests
occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee shall obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. The
guest must have a copy of the letter in his/her possession. In commercial cabins, the permittee or another person listed
on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied by guests or clients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A person whose permit application (new or renewal) for a cabin has been denied or whose cabin permit has been revoked
by the refuge manager may appeal to the Regional Director as described in &sect;36.41(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Existing cabins.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (c) shall apply to all existing cabins,
claimants, occupants, and guests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where a valid cabin permit or lease was in effect on December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added
to the refuge, the refuge manager shall provide for the continuation of the permit or lease under the same conditions.
The new permit shall be nontransferable and renewable every five years unless the continuation would directly threaten
or significantly impair the purposes for which the refuge was established. The cabin and related structures are the
personal property of the claimant and can be removed by him/her upon non-renewal or revocation. The owner of a cabin
may sell his/her interest in the cabin to another person; however, the new owner does not automatically qualify for
a permit and must apply for a new one.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To obtain a special use permit for a cabin that was not under permit or lease before December 2, 1980, or at the time
the land was subsequently added to the refuge, a claimant should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Reasonable proof of possessory interest or right to occupy the cabin as shown by affidavit, bill of sale, or other
document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Date of construction or acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A sketch or photograph that accurately depicts the cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The dimensions of the cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The claimant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within
one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The claimant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin and related
structures are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) A list of family members residing with the claimant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those
immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's
death (this is not applicable to cabins used for commercial purposes).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Applications for permits for existing cabins, which are not currently under valid permits, will only be accepted
for a period of one year following the effective date of these regulations. However, cabins that were legally located
on lands that subsequently become refuge will also be considered ``existing'' cabins. The owners will have two years
following the date the lands become refuge to apply for a permit. Following those dates, all applications for cabins
will be for ``new'' cabins only, no matter when the cabin was built or first used. If ownership is not established within
three years after the land becomes refuge, the cabin may be considered abandoned, and it will become Federal property
in accordance with Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee and his/her family, bona fide partners, and
guests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Major modification or rehabilitation of an existing cabin must be approved by the refuge manager before construction
begins. The modifications will be done by the permittee or designated agent and will remain the property of the permittee.
Major additions (e.g., larger than the original cabin) may fall under the ownership provisions for new cabins. Although
cabins destroyed by accidents, vandalism or natural causes may be reconstructed, they must be approved by the refuge
manager before construction and must meet the construction guidelines for new cabins, even though remaining the
property of the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New cabins.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (d) shall apply to all new cabins, claimants,
occupants, and guests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A nontransferable, five year special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed construction,
use and maintenance of the cabin is compatible with refuge purposes and that the cabin use is either directly related
to refuge administration or is needed for continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the
refuge where the applicant lacks a reasonable off-refuge site. In addition, these activities must have historically
been supported by the construction and use of cabins in the geographic area. In general, new cabin permits will be given
only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence activity. In determining whether to permit the construction,
use, and occupancy of cabins or other structures, the refuge manager shall be guided by factors such as other public
uses, public health and safety, environmental and resource protection, research activities, protection of historic
or scientific values, subsistence uses, endangered or threatened species conservation and other management considerations
necessary to ensure that the activities authorized pursuant to a permit are compatible with the purposes for which
the refuge was established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To obtain a special use permit for a new cabin, an applicant should submit to the refuge manager an application that
includes the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A sketch that accurately depicts the proposed cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The dimensions of the proposed cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the proposed cabin and related
structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The applicant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within
one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The applicant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the cabin and related structures or in the
real property on which the cabin and related structures are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A list of family members residing with the applicant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those
immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's
death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The permitting instrument shall be a nontransferable renewable five year special use permit. It shall be renewed
every five years (upon request) until the death of the original claimant's last immediate family member unless the
special use permit has been revoked or the cabin has been abandoned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No new cabins will be constructed in designated wilderness areas unless they are built specifically for the administration
of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) New trapping cabins in wilderness will be available for public use to ensure public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee, and his/her family, bona fide partners, and
guests.

In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (e) shall apply to all commercial cabins,
permittees, clients, guests, and occupants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A special use permit is required for all cabins used for commercial purposes. Refuge managers may also issue special
use permits that authorize additional commercial use of an existing cabin used for guiding, etc. The use of a new cabin
shall be limited to the type of use specified in the original permit. The refuge manager may permit the use of an existing
cabin on non-wilderness refuge lands for the exercise of valid commercial fishing rights. Such a permit may be denied
if, after conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, it is found that the use is inconsistent with refuge
purposes and is a significant expansion of commercial fishing activities within the unit beyond 1979 levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the commercial fishing or guiding rights associated with a permittee's existing cabin are acquired by a new
party, the privilege of using the cabin cannot be sold and the new party does not necessarily qualify for a cabin permit.
He/she must apply for a permit and meet the criteria described in this paragraph (e) before issuance of a special use
permit by the refuge manager. He/she may not occupy the cabin before issuance of a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No new commercial cabins will be permitted in wilderness areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Commercial cabins may be occupied only by persons legitimately involved in the commercial enterprise, assistants,
employees, their families, guests and clients and only during the time that the authorized activity is occurring.
The names of those individuals, excluding guests and clients, will be listed on the permit. The permittee or another
individual listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Special use permits for commercial cabins may be renewed annually in conjunction with the special use permit renewal
for the commercial activity itself. The cabin permit may be issued for periods of up to five years and is a separate permit
from one issued for the commercial activity.

Administrative and government-owned public use cabins. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (f) apply to all administrative and
government-owned cabins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The refuge manager can designate those cabins not under permit as administrative cabins to be used for official
government business. Administrative cabins may be used by the public during life-threatening emergencies. On a
case-by-case basis, they may also be designated as public use cabins when not needed for government purposes. In such
cases, the refuge manager must inform the public and post dates or seasons when the cabins are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The refuge manager may designate government-owned cabins as public use cabins. They are only intended for short-term
public recreational use and occupancy. The refuge manager may develop an allocation system for managing public use
cabins for short-term recreational use. No existing public use cabins shall be removed or new public use cabins constructed
within wilderness areas designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 or subsequently
designated wilderness areas until the Secretary of the Interior notifies the House Committee on Interior and Insular
Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule sets forth the requirements and procedures for awarding Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funds to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Following issuance of a proposed rule on June 21, 1991, the Department issued an interim rule on April 7, 1992, regarding
the criteria for awarding CDBG funding to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. The Department has decided to
issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim rule and to allow the public
to see how the rule works in conjunction with the latest Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA). This interim rule will
enable Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages to meet with representatives of the HUD Office of Native American
Programs (ONAP) field offices to make suggestions for modification of the regulation before it is issued in final
form.

The authority for the CDBG program for Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages was previously with the Office of
Community Planning and Development; therefore, all previous issuances refer to it under 24 CFR part 571. However,
that authority was transferred recently to the Office of Public and Indian Housing. Therefore, this interim rule
is placed in 24 CFR part 953, and part 571 is removed.

Section 105 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;235) (``Reform
Act''), as amended by the National Affordable Housing Act (``NAHA''), amended Title I of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 (``1974 Act''), by transferring the authority for making grants to Indian Tribes from the
section 107 discretionary fund to the allocation and distribution of funds provisions of Section 106 of the 1974 Act.
Under section 106, as so amended, one percent of the title I appropriation, excluding the amounts appropriated for
use under section 107, is allocated for grants to Indian Tribes. The allocated amount is to be distributed to Indian
Tribes/Villages on a competitive basis in accordance with selection criteria ``contained in a regulation promulgated
by the Secretary after notice and public comment.'' The Department issued the proposed rule on June 21, 1991, at 56
FR 28666, to comply with the requirement for publication for comment. The Department issued an interim rule, April
7, 1992, at 57 FR 11832, to give the public an additional opportunity to comment on the interim rule after it has been
in effect for one round of competition. This revised interim rule is issued to address the comments and will allow the
public to see how the interim rule works in conjunction with the latest NOFA.

Section 953.602 describes applicable relocation and real property acquisition policies, including those implementing
the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). Under the government-wide
URA rule at 49 CFR Part 24, any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organizations, or farm) displaced
on or after April 2, 1989 as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation or demolition for a project assisted under
this part is entitled to URA relocation assistance. The acquisition of real property for a project assisted under
this part is also subject to the URA. The URA policies are described in HUD Handbook 1378, Tenant Assistance, Relocation
and Real Property Acquisition.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received 18 individual comments from 9 sources on the interim
rule published on April 7, 1992. HUD received 6 letters from tribes, and 3 from regional and private organizations.
General comments are discussed below and are followed by specific comments. The specific comments and the Department's
responses are discussed under ``Specific Comments,'' according to the section where they appear in the interim regulation.

General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous comments were received requesting more tribal involvement in the development of the final rule and NOFA.
Also questioned was the need for a national NOFA since the program had operated with a regional competition in the past.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The passage of two statutes, NAHA and the Reform Act, created the need for a national NOFA and revised rule. These statutes
changed the Indian Community Development Block (ICDBG) program selection process. The NAHA required the Secretary
of HUD to promulgate a regulation containing selection criteria used to award funds in competitive programs. The
Reform Act restricts the disclosure of information about HUD programs and discretionary funds. The current interim
ICDBG rule contained changes reflecting the NAHA and Reform Act requirements. As a result of the written comments
received and the consultation sessions held relative to this interim rule, a second interim rule is being published
to continue the process of refining and developing a final rule. HUD is committed to involving the public in this process
to the extent practicable. In order to publish a fair and coherent NOFA, HUD Headquarters consulted extensively with
HUD ONAP field offices throughout the NOFA's development. Since the ONAP field offices are in frequent contact with
the tribes/villages within their jurisdiction, they were able to provide Headquarters with information on how various
NOFA provisions would be received by ICDBG applicants. Following the publication of the NOFA and regulation and after
the selection process has been completed, HUD field staff will hold public meetings to get suggestions on how to improve
the NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the Department's ability to more readily respond to the consultation process, changes to the rating
criteria have been made in this Interim Rule. Sections 953.303, 953.304, and 953.305 have been modified to permit
a wider range of changes to the rating criteria in the NOFA without changing the regulation. The separate rating criteria
has been eliminated for Public Services activities at &sect;953.306. Eligible Public Service activities must still
meet the submission criteria set out in this part.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received concerning the requirement that the applicant must, when reporting income levels to HUD,
include and identify the distribution of tribal or village income to families, households or individuals in the definition
of low and moderate income beneficiary. The commenter pointed out the existence of a Federal statute that might preclude
the use of portions of such payments from being considered income when determining eligibility for federal or federally
assisted programs.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is recognized that such exclusions may exist and the statutory mandates will be followed where appropriate. Their
existence would not necessarily indicate the need for additional language identifying the exclusions. These claimed
exclusions would be identified by the applicant when reporting income to HUD when complying with this section of the
interim rule.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received noting that Indians residing in urban areas and metropolitan cities and not on reservations
do not receive adequate service or funding from IHS and no service from BIA. The commenter suggested that if HUD recognized
these groups it would be beneficial in gaining acceptance with other agencies such as IHS and BIA.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not have legislative authority to provide Federal recognition to Indian Tribes or Alaskan Native
Villages, but deals with those tribes and villages recognized by the Treasury Department and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs as stipulated in this section. The Indian groups residing in urban areas and metropolitan cities and not on
reservations can receive, to the extent such persons are otherwise eligible as low income persons, benefits under
the regular CDBG programs serving the area where they reside.

The commenter also indicated the desire to establish an entitlement program for the Indians. This proposal has been
considered but cannot be adopted without amendments to existing legislation. For these reasons there are no changes
proposed in this section of the interim rule.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters requested that HUD give the field offices latitude in providing more technical assistance on responding
to the NOFA and the submission requirements than presently permitted. Several felt that the tribes/villages are
penalized for not having the sophistication needed to prepare successful applications. One commenter felt that
the lack of technical assistance resulted in some tribes/villages not submitting applications for activities they
felt were most appropriate to address their needs because of the uncertainty of their eligibility or rating. The majority
of the commenters felt that expanded technical assistance was necessary for the tribes/villages to successfully
compete in the program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The technical assistance provisions of the Reform Act limit the direct assistance that may be provided by the Department.
New regulations providing in-depth guidance have been issued by the Department and are expected to more clearly define
the technical assistance role of the Field staff. Technical Assistance during the application process will be provided
to the greatest extent allowed by the Reform Act.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt that the method of setting grant ceilings was not equitable because the established limits in their

Paragraph (b)(1) of this section gives the Assistant Secretary final authority to determine grant ceilings for each
field office. Field offices recommend the ceilings for their jurisdiction. The reason for this process is to ensure
that grant ceilings are appropriate on a national level. The Department has determined that the present procedure
for establishing grant ceilings is the most appropriate method of establishing these limits and proposes no changes
to this section.

HUD will use Census data. HUD recognizes that Census data on Indian and Alaskan native populations may be incomplete
or inaccurate. However, these are the only data that are consistently available, and they are reasonably representative
when aggregated by region. HUD encourages tribes and villages to use their own survey or other locally collected data
in their project applications, after consulting with the ONAP on appropriate data collection methods, if they believe
these to be more reliable.

One commenter suggested that in cases where recaptured funds became available and are offered to a standby applicant
to fund a previously rated and ranked activity, the applicant should be funded on the new cost estimate and not the amount
applied for initially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In all cases where recaptured funds are reallocated to fund a standby application, the Department must insure the
criteria contained in the governing NOFA are met. If the amounts available are not sufficient to fund the application
as proposed, the next highest ranked application would be considered for funding.

This recommendation was considered but not included in the revisions to the interim rule. The current application
process is intended to promote a competition where all applicants have an equal chance for funding and not one that
depends upon an applicant's ability to produce large numbers of projects that could be included in their application.
The present application process leaves the decisions on the type of project to be submitted with the applicant and
does not pass it on to HUD.

The regulation gives applicants

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at least 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30 days to submit their applications to the field office. This minimum level was established so that it is clear that
under any circumstance an applicant would have at least this amount of time to prepare an application. The NOFA will
establish the time in which the applicants have to prepare and submit their applications. The application submission
deadline will continue to be established by Headquarters, since the NOFA is issued on a national basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to streamline this regulation, portions of &sect;953.300, Application requirements, will be moved

This process allows applicants to submit only that information requested by the field office to help clarify the application.
HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 4.105(b)(3) allow authorized employees, during the selection process, to contact applicants
to seek clarification of the terms of an applicant's submission. HUD policy requires each NOFA to include a cure period
for technical deficiencies of at least 14 calendar days. Any deficiency that can be cured (e.g., the submission of
a missing certification) cannot affect the rating of the application in either a positive or negative way and should
by its nature be readily correctable within the present 14 day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portions of &sect;953.301, Screening and review of applications, have been moved from this Interim Rule and will

One commenter requested a reconsideration of the portions of this section that relate to the definition of ``neediest
segment of the population'' in the rating factors for community buildings. This rating factor required that more
than 80% of the beneficiaries be very low income to receive the maximum points. Fifty-one to 79.9 percent of the beneficiaries
must be very low income to receive moderate points.

 While this specific language has been removed from the regulation, it in no way diminishes HUD commitment to empower

Section 953.307(b)(2) of the current regulation gives successful applicants at least 30 days to provide supporting
documentation at the request of the field office, prior to execution of the grant agreement. One commenter suggested
expanding the 30-day period because of the difficulty of preparing and submitting such information to make the application
more competitive within the 30-day time period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has decided to issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim

is issued in final form.

Program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary objective of the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) Program and of the community development program of each grantee
covered under this Act is the development of viable Indian and Alaskan native communities, including decent housing,
a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low- and moderate-income.
The Federal assistance provided in this part is not to be used to reduce substantially the amount of local financial
support for community development activities below the level of such support prior to the availability of this assistance.

Nature of program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICDBG Program is competitive in nature. Therefore, selection of eligible applicants for funds will reflect consideration
of the relative adequacy of applications in addressing locally determined need. Applicants for funding must have
the administrative capacity to undertake the community development activities proposed, including the systems
of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.

Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)), which requires that, to the greatest extent feasible:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises include both of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any economic enterprise as defined in section 3(e) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;262); that
is, ``any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of
profit provided that such Indian ownership and control shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise'';
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any ``Tribal organizations'' as defined in section 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance
Act (Pub. L. 93&hyph;638); that is, ``the recognized governing body of any Indian Tribe; any legally established
organization of Indians which is controlled, sanctioned or chartered by such governing body or which is democratically
elected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by such organizations and which includes the maximum
participation of Indians in all phases of its activities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preference in administration of grant. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the
administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians and Alaskan natives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preference in contracting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under
this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each grantee shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stage 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid
announcement limited to Indian-owned firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stage 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals
limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Develop, subject to HUD field office one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations
or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then
the grantee shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Re-bid the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Re-bid the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If one approvable bid is received, request field office review and approval of the proposed contract and related
procurement documents, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36, in order to award the contract to the single bidder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 24 CFR 85.36 need not
follow the formal bid procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small
purchase procedures of 24 CFR 85.36. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent
feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding solicitation and the bidding documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian
organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises; however, this information need not be submitted to HUD. Grantees
may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal,
or at the time of submission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership, control, and interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including
major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary
or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has
the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded
in connection with a project funded under this part:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent
feasible:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.

preference requirements shall be consistent with the objectives of the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act and shall
not result in a significantly higher cost or greater risk of non-performance or longer period of performance. The
additional Indian preference requirements permitted by this part do not include the imposition of geographic preferences

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Program income received before grant closeout may be retained by the recipient if the income is treated as additional
CDBG funds subject to all applicable requirements governing the use of CDBG funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient chooses to retain program income, that income shall affect withdrawals of grant funds from the
U.S. Treasury as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Program income in the form of repayments to, or interest earned on, a revolving fund shall be substantially disbursed
from the fund before additional cash withdrawals are made from the U.S. Treasury for the same activity. (This rule
does not prevent a lump sum disbursement to finance the rehabilitation of privately owned properties as provided
for in &sect;570.513 of this title.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Substantially all other program income shall be disbursed for eligible activities before additional cash withdrawals
are made from the U.S. Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Program income on hand at the time of closeout shall continue to be subject to the eligibility requirements in subpart
C of this part and all other applicable provisions of this part until it is expended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Unless otherwise provided in any grant closeout agreement, and subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)
of this section, income received after closeout shall not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that,
if at the time of closeout the recipient has another ongoing CDBG grant received directly from HUD, funds received
after closeout shall be treated as program income of the ongoing grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income
received after closeout from the disposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall
not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that such income shall be used for activities that meet one of
the national objectives in 24 CFR 570.208 and the eligibility requirements described in section 105 of the Act.

A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels
described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA)(42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance
to persons displaced by a project that is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide
relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraph (c) of this section at levels in excess of
those required. For assistance that is not required by State or tribal law, the grantee shall adopt a written policy
available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acquisition of real property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the grantee
does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals
prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the grantee from accepting a donation
or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property.
The grantee shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and, when applicable, a justification for any
proposed acquisition payment that exceeds the fair market value of the property. HUD will promptly review the proposal
and inform the grantee of it's approval or disapproval.

A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced
person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that
determination with the grantee. A person who is dissatisfied with the grantee's determination on his or her appeal
may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.

of this section, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24). The grantee shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding
any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent
as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the grantee from any other
source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The grantee shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Displaced person. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For purposes of this section, the term ``displaced person'' means any person (family, individual, business,
nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property,
permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this
part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from real
property that is made: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) After notice by the grantee or property owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after
the date of the submission of an application for financial assistance by the grantee to HUD that is later approved for
the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Before the date of the submission of the application requesting assistance, if either HUD or the grantee determines
that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant moves after execution of the agreement between the grantee and HUD and the move occurs before the tenant
is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary
dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such
reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed
the greater of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 30 percent of gross household income; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary
relocation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are
not reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application for financial assistance to HUD, and,
before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on
the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the
person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of
the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person is not displaced, as defined under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A grantee may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this

(3) Developing and publishing or posting a community development statement in such a manner as to afford affected
residents an opportunity to examine its contents and to submit comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Affording residents an opportunity to review and comment on the applicant's performance under any active community
development block grant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) made the modified application available to residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No part of the requirement under paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to restrict the responsibility

the citizen participation requirements of this section do not include concurrence by any person or group in making
final determinations on the contents of the application.

 Except for the use of ICDBG funds to pay salaries and other related administrative or personnel costs, the general
rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities
with respect to ICDBG activities assisted under this part or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making
process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors to be considered for exceptions:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the requirements
of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or essential expert knowledge to the program or
project which would otherwise not be available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or from the decision-making
process, with reference to the specific assisted activity in question; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph
(b) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Whether undue hardship will result, either to the recipient or to the person affected, when weighed against the
public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any other relevant considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Circumstances under which the conflict prohibition does not apply.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In instances where a person who might otherwise be deemed to be included under the conflict prohibition is a member

as are being made available or provided to the group or class, the prohibition does not apply, except that if, by not
applying the prohibition against conflict of interest, a violation of Tribal or State laws on conflict of interest
would result, the prohibition does apply. However, if the assistance to be provided is housing rehabilitation (or
repair) or new housing, a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided and the specific basis for
the selection of the proposed beneficiaries must be made prior to the submission of an application to HUD. Evidence
of this disclosure must be provided as a component of the application.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One or more corrective or remedial actions will be taken by HUD when, on the basis of the performance review, HUD determines
that the recipient has not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Complied with the requirements of the Act, this part, and other applicable laws and regulations, including the
environmental responsibilities assumed under section 104(g) of title I of the Act;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken by HUD will be designed, first, to prevent the continuance of the deficiency; second, to mitigate
any adverse effects or consequences of the deficiency; and third, to prevent a recurrence of the same or similar deficiencies.
The following actions may be taken singly or in combination, as appropriate for the circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Request the recipient to submit progress schedules for completing approved activities or for complying with
the requirements of this part; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Issue a letter of warning advising the recipient of the deficiency (including environmental review deficiencies
and housing assistance deficiencies), describing the corrective actions to be taken, establishing a date for corrective
actions, and putting the recipient on notice that more serious actions will be taken if the deficiency is not corrected
or is repeated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Advise the recipient that a certification of compliance will no longer be acceptable and that additional information
or assurances will be required; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Advise the recipient to suspend, discontinue, or not incur costs for the affected activity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Advise the recipient to reprogram funds from affected activities to other eligible activities, provided that
such action shall not be taken in connection with any substantial violation of Part 58 and provided that such reprogramming
is subjected to the environmental review procedures of Part 58 of this title; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Advise the recipient to reimburse the recipient's program account or line of credit in any amount improperly expended;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Change the method of payment from a line of credit basis to a reimbursement basis; and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Suspend the line of credit until corrective actions are taken.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A reduction or withdrawal of a grant under paragraph (b) of this section will not be made until at least one of the corrective
or remedial actions specified in &sect;953.702(b) has been taken and only then if the recipient has not made an appropriate
and timely response. Before making such a grant reduction or withdrawal, the recipient also shall be notified and
given an opportunity within a prescribed time for an informal consultation regarding the proposed action.

Secretarial actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Secretary finds a recipient has failed to comply with any provision of this part even after corrective actions
authorized under &sect;953.702 have been applied, the following actions may be taken provided that reasonable notice
and opportunity for hearing is made to the recipient. (The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), where
applicable, shall be a guide in any situation involving adjudications where the Secretary desires to take actions
requiring reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Terminate the grant to the recipient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reduce the grant to the recipient by an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to the amount which was not expended in accordance with this part; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Limit the availability of funds to projects or activities not affected by such failure to comply; provided, however,
that the Secretary may on due notice revoke the recipient's line of credit in whole or in part at any time if the Secretary
determines that such action is necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for activities affected by
such failure to comply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secretarial referral to the Attorney General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If there is reason to believe that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provision of the Act, the
Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate
civil action be instituted. Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States
district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount
of the assistance furnished under this part which was not expended in accordance with this part or for mandatory or
injunctive relief.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading
Service (General Specifications). The proposed changes would revise the requirements for anhydrous milkfat to
allow butter to be used as an ingredient and would revise the requirements for butteroil to allow the addition of safe
and suitable antioxidants. The proposal to allow the use of butter was initiated at the request of the American Butter
Institute.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also has been reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because participation in the USDA-approved
plant program is voluntary and the amendments would not increase the costs to those utilizing the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications, established in 1975, do not provide for butter to be used in making anhydrous milkfat
in USDA-approved dairy plants. This is inconsistent with international standards that allow butter to be used in
anhydrous milkfat. The General Specifications also do not provide for the addition of antioxidants to butteroil,
which also is permitted in international standards. These restrictions have placed the domestic manufacturer at
a disadvantage when competing in the world market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To permit domestic manufacturers of anhydrous milkfat and butteroil to compete on equal terms with manufacturers
from other exporting countries, and to amend the General Specifications to more closely align U.S. requirements
with international standards, USDA is proposing changes to Part 58, subpart B, of the grading and inspection regulations
concerning dairy products, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amend Ingredient Requirements to Permit Butter To Be Used as an Ingredient in Anhydrous Milkfat
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications were established in 1975 and permit only cream to be used as an ingredient in anhydrous
milkfat. The International Dairy Federation and the Codex Alimentarius Commission have both developed internationally
recognized standards that allow the use of butter in making anhydrous milkfat. Revision of the General Specifications
is being proposed to align USDA requirements with internationally recognized standards and allow butter as an ingredient
in anhydrous milkfat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allow the Addition of Antioxidants to Butteroil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications do not provide for the addition of antioxidants to butteroil. International dairy standards
permit the addition of antioxidants to assist in preserving the flavor characteristics of this product. Revision
of the General Specifications is being proposed to align USDA requirements with international standards and to allow
the addition of antioxidants to butteroil, provided the antioxidant used is permitted by standards developed by
the Codex Alimentarius Commission and authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Standards
developed by the Commission may be found in the ``Standard A&hyph;2 for Milkfat Products.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications allow a maximum moisture content of 0.15 percent in anhydrous milkfat. International
standards developed by the International Dairy Federation and the Codex Alimentarius Commission allow a maximum
moisture content of 0.1 percent. Revision of the General Specifications is being proposed to align USDA requirements
with international standards by reducing the maximum allowable moisture content to 0.1 percent.

Provide for the Pasteurization of Oil (Highly Concentrated Milkfat) in the Manufacture of Anhydrous Milkfat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pasteurization of dairy products ensures the destruction of pathogenic organisms. The General Specifications
require cream to be pasteurized in the production of anhydrous milkfat. In some segments of the dairy industry, this
pasteurization step occurs when the milkfat in the cream has been concentrated to a level where it is considered to
be ``oil'' rather than cream. Changes in the General Specifications are being proposed to provide for this industry
practice.

5. Restrict the Amount of Other Butter Constituents in Anhydrous Milkfat When Butter is used as an Ingredient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When butter is used in anhydrous milkfat, the majority of the non-milkfat constituents normally found in butter are
removed during the manufacture of the product. The non-milkfat constituents which are removed include protein,
ash, and salt. Changes are being proposed to restrict the amount of these non-milkfat constituents that would be permitted
to remain in anhydrous milkfat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anhydrous milkfat specifications established by USDA are voluntary specifications that are developed to facilitate
the orderly marketing process. Dairy plants are free to choose whether or not to use the specifications. When manufactured
or processed dairy products are graded or inspected, the USDA regulations governing the grading or inspection of
dairy products are used.

If cream is used in the production of anhydrous milkfat that is eligible for official certification, the anhydrous
milkfat shall be made by a continuous separation process directly from milk or cream. The cream used shall be comparable
to the flavor quality specified above for U.S. Grade AA or U.S. Grade A butter. The milkfat from cream may then be further
concentrated into oil. The cream or oil shall be pasteurized in accordance with the procedures for cream for buttermaking
(&sect;58.334a). If butter is used in the production of anhydrous milkfat that is eligible for official certification,
the butter used shall conform to the flavor requirements of U.S. Grade AA or U.S. Grade A butter, and shall have been

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule invites comments on revising the administrative rules and regulations in effect under the Texas
citrus marketing order. The revision would eliminate the provision which exempts fruit handled for home use from
the order's grade, size, pack, container, inspection and assessment requirements. This proposed rule would help
prevent unauthorized shipments of uninspected citrus from being shipped out of the production area. Individuals
would continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements which should be
sufficient for fruit purchased for home use.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR Part 906] regulating the handling of
oranges and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the order. The agreement
and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is not
intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or
policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses would not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 750 orange and grapefruit producers in south Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 906.40 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container requirements
for fresh shipments of Texas oranges and grapefruit. Whenever such requirements are in effect, oranges and grapefruit
are required to be inspected and certified as meeting applicable standards in accordance with &sect;906.45 of the
order. The program is financed through handler assessments, established pursuant to &sect;906.34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order provides, in &sect;906.42, that regulations issued under &sect;&sect;906.34, 906.40, and 906.45 may
be modified, suspended or terminated to facilitate the handling of citrus fruit for certain purposes. Under this
authority, &sect;906.120 of the order's rules and regulations provides that oranges and grapefruit may be handled
for relief, charity or home use exempt from order requirements. Handlers desiring to utilize this exemption are required
to apply to the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee), the agency established to administer the order locally.
In making an application, the handler is required to submit information such as the quantity of fruit to be handled
under the exemption and its intended destination. Based on the information provided, the committee determines whether
to approve the application and issue the handler a certificate of privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;906.120 by deleting
``home use'' from the provision which allows fruit to be handled exempt from regulation. Current regulations allow
for an unlimited amount of fruit to be shipped for home use (not for resale) exempt from all marketing order requirements.
The committee recommended this amendment to reduce the potential for abuse of the home use exemption. The committee
has had difficulty in verifing the final disposition of exempted fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee expressed concern that bulk loads of uninspected fruit may enter fresh, commercial markets and prove
detrimental to producer returns if the exemption is not removed. Section 906.120(c)(1) is proposed to be amended
by deleting the phrase ``home use''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other exemptions from order requirements would remain unchanged. Under paragraph (a) of &sect;906.120, individuals
would continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements. The committee
believes that this minimum quantity exemption is sufficient to cover fruit purchased for home use and not for resale.
Thus, it is not expected that this action would adversely impact those persons who purchase Texas oranges and grapefruit
directly from handlers for their own use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0068 for oranges and grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would reduce the reporting burden on approximately 6 handlers of oranges and grapefruit who have been completing
the Special Purpose Shipments Form (Application for fundraiser-specialty pack), taking about 5 minutes to complete
each report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. All comments timely received
will be considered prior to issuance of any final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would require an inspection to determine the model and orientation of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight control rods, and replacement with modified rods, if necessary. This proposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted by reports of corrosion found on the pitch and rudder trim and rudder travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiter fail-safe rods. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems associated with corrosion of the flight control rods, which could compromise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required strength of these items.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes.
The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods and the rudder travel
limiter fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes. (This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted
as a part of a sampling program carried out by the manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by
water accumulating in the lower part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rods and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards),
which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated
with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1033, dated February 23, 1994, describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for inspecting the elevator trim, rudder trim, and rudder travel limitation rods to determine the orientation
of the open rod end. It also describes procedures for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with
rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation
of water between the internal and external tubes of the rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service
bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;001&hyph;018(B), dated January 5, 1994,
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1012, Revision 3, dated October 7, 1991, describes procedures for replacing
the currently installed fail-safe control rods with rods that have been modified by the addition of a drain hole in
the non-open end of the rod and the application of a protective treatment. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin
as ``recommended.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1010, Revision 4, dated February 23, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes procedures for reversing the installation of the ends of the elevator tab rod and rudder tab rod so that the
open end of the rods is oriented downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1027, dated July 28, 1993, describes procedures for determining the installation
direction of the fail-safe rod of the rudder travel limitation unit (TLU), and replacing the rod if it is installed
with its open end oriented upwards. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the orientation
of the end of the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods and the rudder travel limiter fail-safe rods, and replacement
of those rods having downwards-oriented ends. The actions would be required to be accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airplanes on which Aerospatiale Modification 02723 and Modification 03110 have been installed are not affected
by the requirements of this proposed AD. The subject flight control rods on those airplanes have been modified prior
to airplane delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 28 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per
work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,240,
or $330 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any
of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if
this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should replacement of any of the flight control rods be necessary, the number of work hours and the cost of required
parts would vary according to the type of replacement accomplished. In a ``worst case scenario'' (all subject rods
needing replacement), the cost of parts would be approximately $8,200 per airplane. Labor necessary to accomplish
replacement of a rod(s) would vary from 2 work hours to 10 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas
Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. This proposal would require modification
of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. This proposal is prompted by an FAA determination that, in the event of a
failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine, an all-engine
flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during or shortly after a fuel dumping operation. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system due to a failure of the number
2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine.

On October 1, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06, amendment 39&hyph;8392, (57 FR 47570, October 19, 1992),
applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 airplanes, Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, and Model KC&hyph;10A
(military) airplanes. That AD requires revising the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include information to specify
that electrical malfunctions may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. That action was
prompted by an incident in which the automatic fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system became inoperative, and fuel was
dumped below the minimum allowable level. Dumping fuel below the minimum allowable level could lead to an all-engine-out

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of that AD, an in-depth review has revealed that the fuel dump shutoff system on Model DC&hyph;10 series
airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A airplanes is such that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the
subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to
fuel starvation during or shortly after fuel dumping operations. This condition, if not corrected, could render
the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system inoperable due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent
loss of the number 2 electrical power source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28&hyph;208, dated April 14, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff
system. This modification provides isolation of the engine fuel system, which entails installation of new fuel relays
and, for certain airplanes, relocation of existing relays. Further, this modification also revises the electrical
wiring for the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system to provide redundant electrical power sources, which minimizes
the possibility of system loss in the event of a number 2 engine shutdown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. The actions would be
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Accomplishment of this
modification will terminate the requirement imposed by paragraph (b) of AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06 to revise the FAA-approved
AFM, which cautioned that electrical malfunctions may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative.

On March 23, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94&hyph;07&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8865 (59 FR 15853, April 5, 1994), applicable
to certain Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, to require a similar modification to terminate the requirement
imposed by paragraph (a) of AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06.]

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 425 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 221 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed
AD, that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,560 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $454,155, or $2,055 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;700A series airplanes. This proposal would require installation of two new circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. This proposal is prompted by a report of smoke in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flight deck due to a lighting transformer 6 volt output circuit short circuiting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the flight deck due to inadequate circuit protection for 6 volt circuits of the flight deck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lighting transformer.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and -700A series airplanes. The CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advises that an incident occurred on a Model HS 125&hyph;700B series airplane when a 6 volt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output circuit from the flight deck lighting transformer on Panel 'RY' overheated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-circuited to ground. This resulted in a release of acrid smoke in the flight deck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation revealed that the 6 volt output circuit was not protected by a fuse or circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaker. This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke and fire in the flight deck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 125&hyph;700A series airplanes are similar in type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design to Model BH/HS 125&hyph;700B series airplanes, the FAA has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
125&hyph;700A series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB.24&hyph;310&hyph;3544A&amp;B, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 14, 1994, which describes procedures for installing circuit breakers in the 6 volt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output circuits of two flight deck lighting transformers. The purpose of the circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breakers is to provide circuit protection for the 6-volt output wires and to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overheating and short circuiting. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel 'RY.' The actions would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 202 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts would cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $212,100, or $1,050 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently requires replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug splice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action would require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies; when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished, this modification would terminate the need for the currently required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement and check. This proposal is prompted by reports of loose or missing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft exhaust plugs, and loss of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rear exhaust plug following an engine bird strike. The actions specified by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent reduced integrity of the engine exhaust plug installation, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may lead to separation of exhaust plugs from the airplane, and create a hazard to persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and property on the ground.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 17, 1983, the FAA issued AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;4544 (48 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5539, February 7, 1983), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, to require replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splice. That AD also requires a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nut plates not meeting the minimum run down torque of five inch-pounds. That action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was prompted by reports of loose or missing attachment screws at the plug splice joint. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one reported incident, the exhaust plug nozzle separated from one engine while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane was in flight. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent separation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exhaust nozzle plug from the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, three operators have reported four incidents of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plugs. These discrepancies were found on airplanes subsequent to the accomplishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05. One operator reported loss of the rear exhaust plug on one airplane after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the engine sustained a bird strike. Investigation revealed that the cause of these loose or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
missing splice joint attachments was attributed to higher temperatures and vibration effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the engine exhaust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators also reported loose nuts at the forward plug-to-engine turbine flange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachments. The cause of these loose nuts has been attributed to high temperature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompatibility of the nut threads with associated threaded studs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These conditions, if not corrected, could result in reduced integrity of the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust plug installation, which may lead to separation of exhaust plugs from the airplane, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and create a hazard to persons and property on the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin 78&hyph;112, Revision 2, dated March 8, 1994, that describes procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies. The modification entails replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of existing fasteners with permanent fasteners having larger diameters; this will serve to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthen the splice installation and minimize the possibility of loose splice joint fasteners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, this modification entails replacement of existing nuts with nuts that are less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible to the effects of higher temperatures and have compatible thread pitch, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizes the possibility of forward plug-to-engine turbine attachments becoming loose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies. The actions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishment of this modification would constitute terminating action for the currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required replacement and check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 110 Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 78 airplanes of U.S. registry would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 46 work hours per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane to accomplish the proposed modification, and that the average labor rate is $55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $21,400 per airplane. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $1,866,540, or $23,930 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the power transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit (PTU). This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the drain port 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housings of the PTU's on several airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent failure of the PTU housing due to fatigue cracking, which could result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received reports of cracked drain port housings found on the power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer units (PTU) installed on five McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In one incident, failure of the housing resulted in the loss of both hydraulic systems, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused the airplane to depart from the runway during taxi due to the loss of braking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nose landing gear steering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation has revealed that the cause of the cracking is attributed to fatigue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further analysis of the hardware has indicated that the center housing and drain port 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing can crack before the design life of the PTU has been reached. This condition, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not corrected, could lead to the failure of the housings associated with the PTU, which in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turn could result in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 29&hyph;53, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision 1, dated April 21, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the center 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing and drain port housing of the PTU. This modification entails replacing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently installed cast aluminum housings with wrought aluminum housings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reidentifying the part number of the PTU. Such modification will ensure that the housings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the PTU design life requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the center housing and drain port housing of the PTU. The actions would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with the McDonnell Douglas service bulletin described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed AD would not be applicable to airplanes that are equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vickers PV3&hyph;160 engine driven pumps. The FAA finds that this type of pump provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized flow of 21 gallons per minute and, in the event of a PTU crack or failure, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of flow would be adequate to continue pressurizing the affected hydraulic system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,074 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 578 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $2,912 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $1,746,716, or $3,022 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80
series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the engine nose cowl.
This proposal is prompted by several in-flight incidents in which the engine nose cowl separated or nearly separated
from the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the engine nose cowl
from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has received reports of several in-flight incidents that have occurred on McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80
series airplanes in which the engine nose cowl separated or nearly separated from these airplanes. Investigation
revealed that these separations occurred following severe vibration of the engine due to failures of the first stage
fan blade. The cause of these separations has been attributed to loose or missing attachment bolts of the engine nose
cowl. This condition, if not corrected, could result in separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during
severe vibration of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;80 Alert Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin A71&hyph;61, dated May 18, 1994, which describes procedures for modification of the left and right engine
nose cowls. This modification entails removal of attachment bolts and nutplates, replacement of nutplates with
self-locking nuts and washers on the engine ``A'' flange, and reversal of attachment bolt direction (bolthead facing
forward). This modification will ensure the integrity of the nose cowl attachment assembly so as to minimize the possibility
of separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the left and right engine nose cowls. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,062 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 540
airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 work hours per
airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would
cost approximately $100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $232,200, or $430 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received from Asgrow Seed Co., Kalamzoo, MI 49004, pesticide petition (PP) 4E4310 on December 6, 1993, proposing
to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.
346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance, the residues of the plant-pesticides watermelon mosaic virus-2
coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cucurbita pepo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 L., and subsequent generations obtained through normal sexual reproduction. An amendment to this petition was received
on April 4, 1994, which changed the proposed exemption by including the genetic material necessary for the production
of these proteins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The squash plants identified as Asgrow line ZW20 have been genetically modified to produce the coat proteins of two
viruses which commonly infect squash plants (watermelon mosaic virus-2 and zucchini yellow mosaic virus). Production
of specific viral coat proteins by the plant will protect it from infection by those viruses. Viral coat proteins,
along with the genetic material (nucleic acids) necessary to produce them in the plant, are designated as plant pesticides
by EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The data considered in support
of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include the following: Sequences of the engineered WMV2 and ZYMV
coat protein coding regions and their resulting coat proteins, Southern blots to show absence of NPT2 gene and non-T-DNA
sequences in ZW 20 squash, levels of WMV2 and ZYMV coat protein deduced from amino acid sequence, and levels of viral
coat proteins in fruit collected from local markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees with the petitioner's contention that components of plant pathogenic viruses, as represented
by the protein coats of zucchini yellow mosaic virus and watermelon mosaic virus-2, present no health concerns when
expressed in edible portions of the plant. The data include evidence to support the lack of any NPT2 marker gene in the
ZW20 plants. Therefore, the only transgene expressed is the viral coat protein. The submitted data include results
of tests to determine the levels of the proteins in market-ready fruit from line ZW20 and related this information
to the normal levels of these viruses in cucurbit fruits pruchased at local markets. These data demonstrated that,
overall, the levels of viral coat proteins in locally grown cucurbit plants were higher than those expressed in the
transgenic squash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for specific viral coat proteins WMV2 and ZYMV is based on the following:
(1) Virus-infected plants have always been a part of the human and domestic animal food supply since most crops are
frequently infected with plant viruses, and food from these crops has been and is being consumed without observed
adverse human health effects; (2) plant viruses have never been shown to be infectious to humans or mammals. Plant
viruses are not able to replicate in mammals or other vertebrates. Thus, there is no possibility of human infection.
In addition, only the portion of the viral genome coding for the whole coat protein or a subcomponent of the coat protein
will be expressed in the ZW20 plants. This portion by itself is incapable of forming infectious particles. Since whole
intact plant viruses are not known to cause deleterious human health effects, it is reasonable to assume that a subunit
of these viruses likewise will not cause adverse human health effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asgrow Seed Co. amended its petition to include the genetic material necessary for the production of the proteins
because EPA considers such genetic material to be part of the plant-pesticide product. It is the genetic material
that is introduced into the plant with the intent that it will ultimately result in a pesticidal effect (i.e., the plant
will produce the viral coat protein). Moreover, the pesticidal proteins could not be produced without the genetic
material being present in the plant. The exemption from a tolerance for the genetic material which codes for the production
of the viral coat proteins is based on the fact that the nucleic acids which form the genetic material are found in all
foods and have not, by themselves, been associated with toxic or pathogenic effects on animals and humans. None of
these constituents of nucleic acids are know to be acute toxicants by themselves but, like proteins and other normal
constituents of food, may cause indirect, adverse metabolic effects if consumed exclusively at high doses over a
long period of time in the absence of a normal balanced diet. Nucleic acids will not occur at these high amounts in ZW20
plants. Thus, EPA does not believe there is any potential for adverse health effects related to the consumption of
the ZW20 plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data and information submitted with this petition are acceptable and are adequate to show that there are no forseeable
human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the consumption of fruit from the Asgrow line ZW20 of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cucurbita pepo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acceptable daily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition
because the data submitted demonstrate that these plant pesticides are not toxic to humans. No enforcement actions
are expected based upon the level of residues of viral coat proteins and the genetic material necessary for their production.
Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to this exemption
request. This will be the first exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for this plant pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plant pesticides in the Asgrow squash line ZW20 are considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from
the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment
of the exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed rule. Comments must bear a notation indicating

 of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), in which it announced that the Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big Horn Ave., Cody,
WY 82414, had requested that the Administrator amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance under section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)) for acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer, FD &amp; C Yellow No. 6 aluminum lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole and octadecyl
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices
in pesticide formulations applied to animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter claimed that among the bases for approval
of the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is an erroneous interpretation of the results of a risk assessment conducted
by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the bases for approval listed in the proposed rule under the subheading ``acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer''
references an FDA risk assessment for acrylonitrile monomer and states, ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;the worst
case exposure to this monomer would result in an upper daily lifetime oncogenic risk of less than 1.2 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based upon a daily lifetime consumption of 1,060 grams of soft drinks contained in acrylonitrile/styrene plastic
beverage bottles (from which the monomer might be expected to migrate) with acrylonitrile monomer concentration
not exceeding 80 ppm.'' The quoted language (49 FR 36635; September 19, 1984) was part of the preamble of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document that amended the food additive regulations at 21 CFR 177.1040(c) to add a description of an acrylonitrile/styrene
copolymer suitable for use in packaging soft drinks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter noted that the maximum residual acrylonitrile monomer content of a finished article intended for such
use is specified in the regulation as 0.10 ppm rather than 80 ppm. The FDA assessment of risk used as a basis of approval
was based upon the 0.10-ppm value. In addition, the commenter asserted that the barrier properties of the acrylonitrile/styrene
copolymer that is the subject of 21 CFR 177.1040 are such that the migration of the residual acrylonitrile monomer
would occur more slowly and to a lesser extent than would be the case for the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer for
which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance was proposed. For the reasons cited above, the commenter claimed
that EPA's citation of the FDA calculation of the lifetime risk from exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile does not
support the action proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the comment and in response EPA has decided to reissue a proposal to establish an exemption from the
requirement of a tolerance for the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer that includes a revised calculation of lifetime
risk from exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile.

II. Application of Assessment in Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Exposure to Acrylonitrile Monomer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data provided by the petitioner regarding the levels of acrylonitrile monomer typically expected to be present in
the subject acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer indicate that the concentration does not exceed 1 part per million
(ppm). Using this concentration of acrylonitrile monomer and the conditions of use of the acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer in animal ear tags, an estimation of exposure to acrylonitrile monomer resulting from the use of acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer as a component of an animal tag or similar devices was conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following assumptions were incorporated into a ``worst-case'' exposure assessment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The subject acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer contains a residual acrylonitrile monomer concentration of
1 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The copolymer comprises 50% of the weight of the tag.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tag weight does not exceed 15 grams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each animal wears two tags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The animal weighs 800 pounds (363.2 kilograms). This would correspond to the lower range of weight for beef cattle,
the predominant wearers of insecticidal animal tags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All acrylonitrile monomer present in the tags migrates into the animal and is not metabolized and/or excreted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A human diet of 3,000 grams per day consists solely of meat emanating from cattle wearing tags containing acrylonitrile
monomer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These ``worst-case'' assumptions produce an estimate of human acrylonitrile monomer dietary consumption of 0.12
microgram per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Toxicity of Acrylonitrile Monomer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in the previously cited 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document establishing a food-additive regulation for acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, the FDA's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition Cancer Assessment Committee concluded from its quantitative risk assessment that
acrylonitrile monomer exposure corresponding to an upper-limit lifetime risk of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, i.e., 1 in 1 million, is about 0.5 to 1.0 microgram per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Extrapolation of Risk for Acrylonitrile Monomer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the above FDA quantitative risk assessment and the ``worst-case'' exposure estimate, EPA concludes that the
upper-limit individual lifetime risk for acrylonitrile monomer resulting from the use of acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer as a component of an animal ear tag is about 1.2 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 2.4 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or slightly more than 1 in 7 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the numerous conservative assumptions included in the worst-case exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged
individual exposure to acrylonitrile monomer is expected to be significantly less than the estimated exposure and,
therefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would be significantly less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Additional Bases of Approval
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of certain chemical substances which are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exlcude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer conforms to the definition
of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria which are used to identify low-risk polymers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum number average molecular weight of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is greater than 1,000. Substances
with molecular weights greater than 400 are generally not readily absorbed through the intact skin, and substances
with molecular weights greater than 1,000 are generally not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
Chemicals not absorbed through the skin or GI tract are generally incapable of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not a cationic polymer nor is it reasonably expected to become a cationic
polymer in a natural aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities,
any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative
or modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than as impurities,
halogen atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain reactive functional groups that are intended or reasonably
anticipated to undergo further reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not designed or reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose,
or depolymerize. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and that the establishment of a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public
health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, which contains the ingredient listed herein, may request, within
30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of FFDCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP&hyph;300296]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposed rule that would amend primarily the regulations that govern how the Secretary of the Interior, through
the Bureau of Land Management, administers livestock grazing was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14314). That proposed rule is a part of the Department's Rangeland Reform '94, an effort to improve
the administration of grazing. The original comment period on the proposed rule was to end on July 28, 1994. The comment
period is being extended until September 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the development of the proposed rule and since the opening of the comment period on the Rangeland Reform '94
proposal, the Governors of several States have organized groups to consider the Department's proposals. The Governor
of Wyoming has established one such group which is developing comments and alternative actions to be considered.
The Governor of Wyoming has requested an extension of the comment period to provide the Wyoming working group sufficient
time to complete their model for rangeland reform. In keeping with the Department's intent to encourage collaborative
efforts in the resolution of difficult public land management issues, the comment period on the proposed rule is being
extended until September 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elements of Rangeland Reform '94 have been analyzed through a draft environmental impact statement (EIS), notice
of which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25118). The Forest Service is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the EIS. The comment period
on the draft EIS ends August 11, 1994, but the Department is considering the need to extend the EIS comment period to
coincide with the closing of the comment period on the related proposed rule. Any extension of the comment period for
the draft EIS will be made through a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A key provision of the Department's proposed rule published March 25, 1994, would raise the Federal grazing fee to
a level more closely reflecting market value. Under the proposed rule the grazing fee would be charged for each animal
unit month (AUM) of grazing on Federal lands. An AUM was defined, for billing purposes, as a month's use and occupancy
of range by one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, mule, five sheep, or five goats, over the age of six months at
the time of entering the public lands or other lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM); for all such
weaned animals regardless of age; and for such animals that will become 12 months of age during the authorized period
of use. This document requests comment from the public regarding whether the definition of an AUM for billing purposes,
as it pertains to sheep, should be six or seven sheep, rather than five sheep. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicits comments on this aspect of the proposed rule in recognition of the decline in the number of
sheep operators and number of sheep AUMs authorized on public lands over the last 20 years. During the period of 1975
through 1993 the number of sheep operators using public rangelands administered by the BLM dropped from 2,490 to 1,624.
During the same period the number of AUMs authorized for sheep use dropped from about 1.8 million to about 1.2 million.
The decline in sheep grazing on the public lands may be attributed to a number of factors, but has resulted in a shift
from sheep to cattle in many areas where grazing by sheep would be environmentally and administratively preferable.
It has come to the attention of the Department that the long-term trend in the shift from sheep to cattle may be accelerated
by recent changes in market factors such as the phase-out of wool incentive and unshorn lamb payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public is asked to provide information addressing whether or how the proposed rule might affect the long-term
trend in the shift from sheep to cattle. In particular, the Department is inviting comment on the effect of changing
the definition of an AUM for billing purposes in a manner that would reduce the proposed grazing fee that would be charged
for the use of public lands by sheep by 17 percent if the number of sheep per billing unit would be changed from five to
six, or 28 percent if changed from five to seven. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adjustment in the definition of an AUM for billing purposes would not affect the manner in which sheep stocking rates
are determined. It would only affect the price paid for the use of public lands by sheep. Stocking rates are determined
by, among other things, assessing the capacity of the public lands for a given kind of livestock. The equivalency between
cattle and sheep expressed in the definition of an AUM for billing purposes is not used by the BLM in determining stocking
rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends that any change in the definition of an AUM for billing purposes would not affect the proposed
30 percent incentive fee reduction.

This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, adopted June 13, 1994, and released July 6, 1994.
The complete text of this Commission action, including the proposed rule amendments, is available for inspection

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A commercial radio operator license is required to be held by a person who operates stations in a number of radio services.
To qualify for certain of these licenses, an applicant must pass an examination(s) that is administered by one of the
nine Commission-certified Commercial Operator License Examination (COLE) Managers. Within 10 days of completion
of an examination element(s), the COLE Manager must issued a Proof-of-Passing Certificate (PPC) to an examinee who
scores a passing grade on an examination element. When the examinee is credited for all examination elements required
for the commercial operator license sought, the examinee applies to the Commission for the license. The Commission
then processes the application and, if the applicant is fully qualified, grants the license. Total processing time
may be as much as eight weeks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We are dedicated to providing better and friendlier service to our customers. One significant way we can further
this goal is by permitting applicants who have passed the qualifying examinations and applied for a commercial radio
operator license to perform the functions of a commercial radio operator prior to receiving the Commission license.
This would be a significant benefit to persons who must have the license as a condition of employment by allowing them
to start work immediately. Providing for such temporary conditional operating authority would product a secondary
benefit by likely applicants receiving their Commission-issued licenses sooner because there would be a reduction
in the number of inquiries to the processing staff regarding the status of pending applications. Answering such inquires
diverts resources from the primary task of processing license applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We propose to amend &sect;&sect;13.9 and 13.13 of the Commission's Rules to provide temporary conditional operating
authority to successful examinee upon properly filing an application with the Commission. This proposed temporary
operating authority, however, would not apply to any person who has previously had a commercial radio operator license
revoked, suspended, or is the subject of an ongoing suspension proceeding. In addition, the proposed rules provide
that the Commission, in its discretion, may cancel the temporary conditional operating authority without a hearing,
if the need for such action arises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For purposes of making log entries, the Commission proposed that a commercial radio operator exercising temporary
conditional operating authority would enter the PPC serial number and date of issue in place of the FCC-issued license
serial number and expiration date. Possession of the PPC document would activate the operating authority of proposed
&sect;13.9(d) and &sect;13.13(d) and would thereby serve in the stead of the license temporarily and conditionally.
This procedure would be verifiable and simple to implement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule making proceeding is initiated to obtain comments concerning proposed rule changes to Part 13 of the Rules
to permit a person who has passed the examinations necessary to qualify for a commercial radio operator license, but
who has not yet received the license, to temporarily and conditionally perform the functions of a commercial radio
operator.

Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any rule changes adopted as a result of this proceeding may affect various small entities that require an individual
to hold a commercial radio operator license as a condition of employment. Potentially, small entities could hire
commercial radio operator licensees sooner than under present licensing procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mercury-containing lamps (light bulbs) may be hazardous waste under the Toxicity Characteristic Rule issued under
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and if so, must be managed as a hazardous waste, unless they are a
household waste or are generated by an exempted small quantity generator. Mercury-containing lamps include fluorescent,
high pressure sodium, mercury vapor and metal halide lamps. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today seeking
comment on two alternative approaches for the management of mercury-containing lamps. First, EPA is seeking comment
on whether an exclusion from regulation as hazardous waste is appropriate for mercury lamps, provided they are disposed
in municipal landfills that are permitted by States/Tribes with EPA approved municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill
permitting programs or managed in mercury reclamation facilities that are permitted, licensed or registered by
States/Tribes. The second approach would add mercury lamps to EPA's Universal Waste Proposal (February 11, 1993,
58 FR 8102). The Universal Waste approach is a streamlined, reduced regulatory structure, which is designed to address
the management of certain widely generated wastes currently subject to full Subtitle C RCRA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposal presents management options that would be considered less stringent than the existing Federal
regulations because they would exempt certain activities now within the purview of RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste
management). Therefore, States authorized under RCRA section 3006 to administer and enforce a hazardous waste system
in lieu of the Federal program would be allowed flexibility in modifying their programs to adopt less stringent regulations
regarding the management of mercury-containing lamps, should one of the proposed options be promulgated as a final
rule.

A. The Toxicity Characteristic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 3001 of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is charged with defining which solid wastes are hazardous by identifying the characteristics of hazardous
waste and by listing particular hazardous wastes. Toxicity is one of the four characteristics used by EPA to identify
waste as hazardous (along with ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity). EPA promulgated the Extraction Procedure
Toxicity Characteristic (EPTC) on May 19, 1980. The EPTC regulated eight metals, four insecticides, and two herbicides.
Section 3001(g) of RCRA, added by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, required EPA to revise the
EPTC. On March 29, 1990 (55 FR 11798), the EPA promulgated the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) to revise the existing
EPTC. Like the EPTC, the TC and its associated testing methodology, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure
(TCLP) is used to define the toxicity of a waste by measuring the potential for the toxic constituents in the waste to
leach out of an unlined municipal landfill into groundwater and contaminate drinking water wells at levels of health
or environmental concern if not subject to Subtitle C controls. The TC implemented an improved leaching procedure
that better predicts leaching and added several hazardous waste constituents. Twenty-five organic hazardous waste
constituents were added to the TC and a model was developed to predict their fate and transport in the groundwater.
If wastes exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic they are subject to the hazardous waste management requirements of
RCRA Subtitle C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preamble to the Toxicity Characteristic Rule (March 29, 1990, 55 FR 11813), the regulatory levels
for the TC metals were not changed by the promulgation of the final TC rule. EPA retained the regulatory levels set by
the EPTC rule, pending further study of the fate and transport of metals in groundwater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is continuing longer-term developmental work on a metal speciation model, called MINTEQ, to be used to
evaluate the fate and transport of the TC metals (including mercury) for purposes of reassessing the toxicity characteristic
regulatory levels for the TC metals. EPA's preliminary analysis indicates that mercury that would leach out of landfills
would not all necessarily travel far enough through the groundwater to contaminate drinking water wells, depending
on the distance to the well. A certain percent (still to be determined) will combine with other substances in the soil
(via complexation, adsorption, etc.) to form solid substances and remain in the soil. Therefore, the regulatory
limits for mercury if re-assessed using the MINTEQ model, when completed, might be higher (less stringent) than the
current limits because mercury may be less mobile than the current TC rule indicates. However, these studies are still
ongoing (U.S. EPA, 1991b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available data (included in the docket for this proposal) indicate that as a result of the use of mercury in the production
of fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, a relatively high percentage of these lamps, when spent,
exhibit the characteristic of toxicity. (U.S. EPA, 1992a) However, all generators of spent lamps that exhibit the
toxicity characteristic may not have to manage those lamps as hazardous waste. EPA has specified different requirements
for generators of hazardous waste depending on the amount of hazardous waste generated per month. Conditionally-exempt
small quantity generators (CESQG) generate less than 100 kilograms (kg) of hazardous waste each month and can send
their waste to a hazardous waste facility, or may elect to send their wastes to a landfill or other facility approved
by the State for industrial or municipal non-hazardous wastes (see 40 CFR 261.5). Generators of more than 100 kg of
hazardous waste per month are required to fully comply with Federal hazardous waste regulations (although generators
of between 100 and 1000 kg of hazardous waste per month are subject to certain reduced regulatory requirements).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For the purposes of this proposal ``electric lamp'' also referred to as ``lamp'' is defined as the bulb or tube portion
of a lighting device specifically designed to produce radiant energy, most often in the ultraviolet, visible, and
infra-red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of common electric lamps include but are not limited
to, incandescent, fluorescent, high intensity discharge, and neon lamps. Also, a ``mercury-containing lamp''
is defined as an electric lamp in which mercury is purposely introduced by the manufacturer for the operation of the
lamp. The Agency requests comment on whether the definitions of ``lamp'' and ``mercury-containing lamp'' are technically
correct and on whether they accurately define the appropriate universe of items.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Energy-Efficient Lighting Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Today's proposal, which would reduce management requirements for lamps, is expected to support the efforts of many
existing and planned energy conservation programs, which encourage the installation of energy efficient lighting.
Energy efficient lighting consumes less electricity, reducing the generation of pollution from power plants. However,
replacing energy inefficient lighting systems with energy efficient lighting systems requires the use and eventual
disposal of fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, which contain mercury. Requiring the disposal
of lamp wastes as hazardous waste, under full Subtitle C regulations, may discourage participation in energy efficient
lighting programs. The Agency anticipates that either of the proposed actions will encourage participation in energy-efficient
lighting programs, and will therefore promote the energy-efficiency and the environmental benefits derived from
that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If energy-efficient lighting were used wherever it is profitable, the nation's demand for electricity could be cut
by more than 10 percent. This would result in reductions of estimated annual carbon dioxide emissions of 202 million
metric tons (4 percent of the national total), reductions of annual sulfur dioxide emissions of 1.3 million metric
tons (7 percent of the national total), and reductions of annual nitrogen oxide emissions of 600,000 metric tons (4
percent of the national total). (U.S. EPA, 1992b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, EPA initiated a voluntary energy conservation program called ``Green Lights'' to encourage pollution prevention
through energy efficient lighting. Lighting accounts for 20&hyph;25 percent of electricity used annually in the
U.S. Lighting for industry, businesses, offices, and warehouses represents 80&hyph;90 percent of total lighting
electricity use. Available technologies in energy efficient lighting can reduce lighting electricity demand by
over 50 percent, enabling power plants to generate less electricity and burn less fuel. It also reduces other types
of pollution resulting from mining and transporting power plant fuels and disposing of power plant wastes (U.S. EPA,
1992b). In addition, electric utilities, when burning fossil fuels, emit mercury at a rate of 0.0428 mg/kWh sold,
on a national average. Full implementation of Green Lights is estimated to reduce the emission by 9.7 Mg of mercury
by the year 2000 (U.S. EPA, 1992b). Further, the energy-efficient fluorescent lamps, used by Green Lights and other
energy conservation programs, contain less mercury than energy-inefficient fluorescent lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A goal of Green Lights is to encourage the widespread use of efficient lighting technologies to reduce air pollution
from coal combustion. Energy-efficient lighting technologies provide excellent investment opportunities. A
typical lighting upgrade yields an internal rate of return of 20&hyph;30 percent and a payback of 3&hyph;4 years.

Green Lights participants include: Corporations; State, city, and county governments; lighting manufacturing
and management companies; electric utilities; non-profit organizations; and hospitals, universities, and other
businesses throughout the U.S. Green Lights encourages the establishment of comprehensive energy-efficient lighting
programs within an organization that include: Converting from less-efficient fluorescent to more-efficient fluorescent
lamps; converting from incandescent to compact fluorescent lamps; converting from magnetic to electronic lighting
ballasts; installing occupancy sensors, daylight dimmers, and other lighting control technologies; installing
more efficient luminaries or lighting fixtures; and efficient maintenance practices, such as group relamping and
regular fixture cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By signing a partnership agreement with the EPA, Green Lights participants agree to survey and upgrade, within 5 years,
90 percent of all domestic facilities wherever profitable and wherever lighting quality is improved or maintained.
In return, these participants should receive reductions (savings) in their monthly energy expenses. A good energy-efficient
lighting upgrade typically includes some type of control strategy (such as occupancy sensors) that will reduce lamp
burning hours. The result is that the lamp will last longer and need to be replaced less frequently. As of June 30, 1993,
over 1,000 organizations have joined the Green Lights program. These organizations have committed over 3.5 billion
square feet of facility space to the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Green Lights Program encourages the use of energy-efficient lamps using an initial and scheduled periodic relampings
to achieve higher energy efficiency and reduce energy costs. These relampings involve removal and replacement of
all lamps in a building or in an area at one time, as opposed to replacement of lamps as they burn out. An initial lighting
upgrade and group relamping may result in a large number of fluorescent lamps that require disposal. In some instances,
a participant that would usually be a conditionally exempt small quantity generator, could become a large quantity
generator of hazardous waste due to the large number of lamps generated in one month. In general, if a generator disposes
of more than approximately 350 four foot fluorescent lamps, that generator is a large quantity generator due to lamps
alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the environmental and financial benefits of energy efficient lighting systems, there are disincentives
to participating in an energy conservation program like Green Lights. Establishing a comprehensive energy-efficient
lighting program and installing energy-efficient lighting technologies require an initial investment that may
be significant, depending on the size and comprehensiveness of the project. Although Green Lights provides information
to participants on financing options, many profitable lighting upgrade projects are delayed due to restricted availability
of capital. It is especially difficult for smaller businesses and government organizations to raise the necessary
capital, although energy-efficient lighting investments are low risk and in the long run will reduce costs. The additional
costs associated with managing, transporting, and disposing of lighting wastes as hazardous wastes can create an
additional disincentive to join Green Lights and make the initial investment in energy-efficient light technologies.
For example, under the hazardous waste regulations, large quantity generators are required to label boxes and drums,
notify EPA of status as a hazardous waste generator, transport waste via a hazardous waste transporter, manage waste
consistent with the land disposal restrictions, and manage waste at a hazardous waste management facility. In addition,
on May 8, 1994, generators of mercury-containing lamps will be required (under the Land Disposal Restrictions) to
meet a treatment standard for lamps as hazardous debris. As is discussed in detail in Section VII, Economic Impact
Analysis, of this preamble, the Agency estimates that the annual national cost of Subtitle C compliance for large
quantity generators could range from 110 to 134 million dollars. EPA's preliminary estimates suggest that an exclusion
would save generators of mercury containing lamps approximately 85 to 102 million dollars annually, while the inclusion
of lamps in the universal waste management system would save generators approximately 16 to 20 million dollars annually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Green Lights program may increase the number of large quantity generators on months when mass relamping
occurs, the program is not expected to increase the total quantity of used fluorescent lamps in the long run. The lamps
recommended by the Green Lights program are more energy efficient and with implementation of energy saving practices,
these lamps could have an extended life of four to five years rather than the average three to four years. Therefore,
if by reducing the initial costs of participation in the Green Lights program, generators participate in the Green
Lights Program, an energy savings will occur. These additional energy savings will decrease the amount of mercury
and other pollutants emitted to in the atmosphere from coal-burning.

C. Industry Source Reduction Initiatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A report, ``The Management of Spent Electric Lamps Containing Mercury,'' by the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (NEMA, 1992) discussed industry efforts to reduce mercury in fluorescent lamps. According to the report,
due to the use of more efficient dosing techniques (i.e., placing mercury in the lamp), the average mercury content
of a standard 4-foot, 11/2 inch diameter, cool white fluorescent lamp was reduced by 14% (48.2 mg/lamp to 41.6 mg/lamp)
from 1985 to 1990. Future industry projections of mercury reductions by 1995 show an estimated 35% further reduction
(41.6 mg/lamp to 27.0 mg/lamp) for the standard fluorescent lamp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source reduction, which is the reduction or elimination of the toxicity and/or volume of a waste product, is at the
top of EPA's hierarchy of municipal solid waste (MSW) management methods. With regard to mercury, the most significant
source reduction achievement has been the trend toward elimination of mercury from alkaline batteries. Although
these batteries are still a significant contributor of mercury to municipal solid waste, discards of mercury from
alkaline batteries are dropping dramatically because of source reduction achievement. Mercury-containing lamps
are one of the next highest single sources of mercury in the municipal solid waste, accounting for 3.8% of mercury now
going to MSW landfills. EPA encourages cost-effective source reduction of mercury in fluorescent lamps. Opportunities
exist to reduce mercury content levels in both standard 4-foot fluorescent lamps and the increasingly popular compact
fluorescent lamps (U.S. EPA, 1993b). If source reduction is pursued aggressively by the fluorescent lamp manufacturing
industry, the overall contribution of mercury from fluorescent lamps to municipal solid waste could remain constant
or decrease over time even as fluorescent lamp usage increases.

EPA requests comment on industry and other source reduction initiatives involving the reduction of mercury in fluorescent
lamps. Source reduction may be occurring through more efficient dosing techniques, lightweighting of lamps, and
changes in phosphor powder technology. The Agency requests comments reflecting these and any other source reduction
activities and may use this information to develop a strategy to support and encourage voluntary source reduction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This section presents the technical information used by the Agency in developing options for the management of used
mercury-containing lamps. Information is provided on the environmental fate and transport in the ground water and
air pathway for mercury. Specifically, EPA has reviewed leachate data from municipal landfills and data on air emissions
from municipal waste combustors and municipal landfills. In addition, the Agency has estimated possible releases
of mercury to the air from lamps broken during storage and transportation. Most of the information considered pertains
to management in municipal landfills. Information on other types of non-hazardous landfills is not presented due
to a lack of data and the wide variability in design and waste composition of other non-hazardous landfills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on the data presented in this section of the preamble. These data, along with any data submitted
in the public comment to this proposal, will be used to determine the risk to human health and the environment from the
management of used mercury-containing lamps. Also, some information on the risks of managing mercury-containing
lamps in landfills, combustors and recovery facilities was submitted to the Agency in response to a request for such
information in the Universal Waste Proposal (February 11, 1993, 58 FR 8102). This information is included in the rulemaking
docket for today's proposal and the Agency requests comment on it.

A. Groundwater Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This section discusses leachate samples collected by EPA from municipal landfills. As previously discussed, the
Agency is further developing its groundwater model under the TC to accurately predict the movement of mercury through
the groundwater system. The groundwater pathway for mercury is being considered because the TC uses the groundwater
pathway to estimate the movement of contaminants from municipal landfills. The leachate data indicate that further
analysis may be needed on the behavior and movement of mercury in municipal landfills and in groundwater, although
initial analyses indicate that mercury is less mobile than previously believed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has collected data indicating that mercury may not leach from MSW landfills at levels above the drinking water
MCL, despite some mercury disposal in MSW landfills. EPA estimates that approximately 73% of municipal solid waste
(MSW) is placed in municipal landfills, while 14% of municipal solid waste is incinerated and 13% is recycled. Based
on a study of mercury production and use, the Agency estimates that about 643 metric tons (Mg) of mercury is discarded
in MSW landfills per year. A major source of mercury in municipal solid waste is household batteries which accounts
for about 88% of the 565 metric tons (Mg) of mercury in municipal solid waste. Most of these batteries fall under the
Household Waste Exclusion (see 45 FR 33119, May 19, 1980). Thermostats/thermometers and mercury-containing lamps
are second in their contribution of mercury in municipal solid waste, 3.9% and 3.8% respectively. The Agency estimates
that, assuming all lamps are disposed of in MSW landfills, approximately 20 Mg of mercury would be placed in MSW landfills
per year from used mercury-containing lamps. (U.S. EPA, 1991c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on the amounts of mercury in MSW landfill leachate are included in a study summarizing the available data on MSW
landfill leachate characteristics conducted by the Office of Solid Waste (U.S. EPA, 1988). Out of 109 leachate mercury
analyses collected, only six (7 percent) were above the drinking water level or maximum contaminant level (MCL) for
mercury (0.002 mg/L) and none were above the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) limit for mercury (0.2 mg/L). The average
of these MSW leachate analyses was 0.0008 mg/L mercury. The maximum concentration reported is 0.0098 mg/L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further analysis indicates that less than 0.01 percent of the mercury in MSW landfills leaches from the landfill.
This estimate is supported by a study measuring mercury disposition (in landfill gas and leachate) in four Swiss landfills
which found around .007 percent of the mercury from the landfill in the leachate (Baccini et al., 1987).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The behavior of mercury in a MSW landfill is not known in great detail. The complexity of aqueous mercury chemistry
makes it difficult to predict and model at this time. However, the available information suggests that chemical conditions
tend to favor the metallic form of mercury in MSW landfills. This form has a lower solubility in water (0.02&hyph;0.04
mg/L) than other chemical forms. In addition, EPA has identified studies that indicate that municipal solid waste
has a significant capacity for retaining mercury in the landfill unless there are unusually large quantities of mercury
in municipal solid waste (Gould et al., 1988/Mennerich, 1985). The Agency has not seen field data for industrial non-hazardous
landfills.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition, the Agency reviewed 1990 and 1991 Superfund Records of Decision (RODs) for information on municipal
landfill sites where mercury was listed as a contaminant of concern (COC). A total of twelve out of sixty-six 1990 and
1991 RODs for landfills accepting municipal waste listed mercury as a COC. Of these 12 sites, 5 had mercury detections
in ground-water over the MCL. All but one of these sites had confirmed industrial waste codisposal. At this site only
onsite ground-water exceeded the MCL for mercury (maximum of 0.013 mg/L); all offsite ground-water samples were
below detection limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, preliminary data and analysis suggest at this time that mercury in municipal solid wastes is not being
readily released by leaching processes that typically occur in the MSW landfill environment. This indication is
also supported by controlled leaching studies of high-concentration mercury-containing wastes codisposed with
municipal solid waste (Borden et al., 1990/Gould et al., 1988). However, the Agency requests that commenters provide
any MSW landfill leachate or groundwater data, or data from industrial Subtitle D landfills, that EPA has not considered
in its analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency is also reviewing data on the air pathway for mercury because low levels of mercury in surface water have
caused elevated fish concentrations at many sites in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, and other States,
and these elevated levels of mercury have been attributed to atmospheric deposition from non-specific sources (U.S.
EPA, 1993a). Therefore, EPA reviewed data on mercury emissions to air from a number of sources, including those potentially
related to lamp disposal. EPA also considered available data on the fate and transport of mercury of mercury emitted
to the air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of elemental mercury's high vapor pressure, it is easily volatilized into the atmosphere. Two factors are
believed to contribute to the recent increases in atmospheric deposition of mercury compounds. The first factor
is increased atmospheric levels from mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, chloralkali plants, MWC facilities,
and other sources. The second factor is increased oxidation of atmospheric elemental mercury vapor to more soluble
oxidized forms which is enhanced by anthropogenic (i.e., pollution from man-made sources) increases in atmospheric
oxidizing agents, such as ozone and inorganic acids. Based on current mercury emissions inventories EPA believes
that major mercury emission source categories include coal fired power plants, municipal waste combustors and medical
waste combustors. (U.S. EPA, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mercury that is methylated is strongly biomagnified through the food chain through bioconcentration in animals,
and in plant tissue. Methylation is a chemical process in which a methyl unit is added to either elemental or oxidized
mercury. The primary environmental human exposure pathway for mercury is through the consumption of contaminated
fish. Fish bioconcentration factors (fish tissue concentration/water concentration) are as high as 85,000. Recently,
elevated levels of mercury in fish in isolated, pristine lakes have been identified in widespread areas around the
country. There are currently over 1,550 fish consumption bans or advisories due to mercury in effect in the United
States (Sorensen et al, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there may be insufficient data to determine whether mercury from lamps will endanger human health and environment
by the release of mercury to the air, there are concerns over emissions of mercury from lamps from municipal waste combustors,
possibly landfill gas, as well as concerns with the handling and disposal of mercury lamps. In this section, available
information will be discussed pertaining to the hazards of mercury via air exposure.

(1) Incineration

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency estimates that approximately 14% of U.S. municipal solid waste is burned in municipal waste combustors
(MWCs), comprising 23 million metric tons (Mg) of waste. Approximately 100 Mg of mercury-containing waste is burned
in municipal waste combustors, of which about 3 Mg/yr is mercury-containing lamps (U.S. EPA, 1990). Because of its
low boiling point, elemental mercury in the waste is largely vaporized during municipal waste combustion and, without
controls specific to mercury, passes out of the municipal waste combustor into the atmosphere with the flue gas. Measurements
have shown that for several municipal waste combustors with emissions controls for sulfur and nitrogen oxide particulates,
average MWC mercury emission factors range from 70 to 90 percent of the mercury input (Vogg et al, 1986/Reiman, 1989).
If we assume that 98% of the mercury in incinerated municipal solid waste is volatilized during combustion this would
potentially generate 98 Mg/year mercury emissions of this, about 2.9 Mg/year would be from mercury-containing lamps.
Post-combustion mercury control at the municipal waste combustor's would reduce mercury levels by 80% to 90%.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA plans to propose mercury emission limits for new and existing municipal waste combustors in 1994 (U.S. EPA, 1991a).
The mercury emission limits will be based on the use of activated carbon injection for mercury control as demonstrated
by EPA at tests at the Stanislaus municipal waste combustor (California) and Camden municipal waste combustor (New
Jersey). These tests demonstrated activated carbon injection technology as available for post-combustion mercury
control at municipal waste combustors and achieved mercury reduction levels of 80 to 90 percent. During the tests,
activated carbon was injected into the flue gases upstream of the acid gas control system and collected (with the mercury)
in the particulate matter control system. The ash from the particulate matter control system was then landfilled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unclear to what degree the mercury being released from municipal waste combustors would contribute to increased
mercury levels in surface waters because the transport and cycling of atmospheric mercury emissions are complex
and poorly understood. It is uncertain how long mercury will stay in the atmosphere after being released. The oxidation
state of mercury dictates how long it remains in the air. Elemental mercury could stay in the atmosphere for months
to years, whereas an oxidized species of mercury would stay for only days to weeks. Although controversy remains over
the form of mercury as it leaves the MWC stack, it is likely that mercury from a municipal waste combustor would be more
oxidized and therefore would not remain in the atmosphere for a long period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since MWC facilities comprise one anthropogenic source of atmospheric mercury, there are probably regional-scale
or global-scale impacts from such sources (Glass et al., 1986/Johnson, 1987). The elimination of mercury-containing
lamps from municipal waste combustors would reduce annual atmospheric mercury emissions from these significant
sources by around 3 metric tons, or about 3 percent of the total mercury-bearing waste that is incinerated. The Agency
is considering proposing air emission controls for mercury later this year which would, when implemented, reduce
these emissions.

(2) Mercury in Landfill Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA evaluated emissions of mercury in landfill gas emission in its ``Preliminary Risk Assessment'' which is available
in the public docket (EPA, 1993). EPA reviewed studies on the amount of mercury that may be released to the air from municipal
solid waste landfills. Specifically, this section presents in detail the results of two studies that attempt to measure
mercury air releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Swiss study (Baccini et al., 1987) measured the amount of landfill gas from four municipal landfills. This study
is comparable to municipal solid waste landfills in the U.S. because the study indicated that these Swiss MSW landfills
contained approximately 2 parts per million (ppm) of mercury, which, given the standard error range, is comparable
to the approximately 3.6 ppm of mercury in U.S. municipal solid waste (U.S. EPA, 1990). The Swiss study indicated that
mercury concentrations in landfill gases had a mean value of about 0.4 &mu;g/cubic meter. The annual total mercury
release also was low (0.0065 mg/Mg waste, average). Using this gas release value, and the amount of municipal solid
waste annually disposed in U.S. landfills (118 million Mg), the amount of mercury annually released in landfill gas
can be estimated as 0.8 kg, about 0.0001 percent of the total mercury load entering MSW landfills (643 Mg). Adjusting
the proportion of total mercury contributed by mercury-containing lamps to the MSW stream (3.8 percent), provides
an estimate of annual landfill gas emissions from lamps of about 0.03 kg, less than 0.00001 percent of the total municipal
solid waste mercury input (EPA, 1993). The amount of mercury from lamps emitted into the atmosphere by landfill gas
is very small (.00003 Mg) when compared to the 3 Mg of mercury from lamps that is estimated to be emitted into the atmosphere
through municipal waste combustors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received a study (National Environmental Protection Board et al, 1989) in a comment to the Universal Waste
Proposal that provided data on mercury gas from four municipal landfills in Sweden. The Swedish study measured the
ambient air quality above four municipal landfills. The study did not indicate the level of mercury in the municipal
landfills. Mercury was measured using differential optical adsorption spectroscopy (DOAS), located two meters
above the landfill, compared with background mercury concentrations measured at each of the four landfills. The
mean ranged from 10.2 ng/m

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The report stated that because all measurements were close to the detection limit for the DOAS technique, the reliability
of the results was questioned. After a review, it was determined that although the quantification was uncertain because
of a low signal-to-noise ratio, the concentration above the landfills was significantly above background mercury
levels, indicating that mercury was being released to the atmosphere. However, since it is unknown how much mercury
is found in Swedish municipal solid waste landfills, the results of this study cannot be readily compared to the situation
in the U.S.

(3) Crushing and Breakage of Lamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mercury remains in lamps until they are broken. When lamps break, the elemental mercury inside becomes available
for evaporation, adsorption, or reaction. EPA modeled mercury emissions from broken lamps based on two different
methods of transportation (EPA, 1993). Discarded lamps may be transported in one of two ways: In refuse trucks as household
or commercial trash, and in closed vans or trailers as part of a bulk relamping program. Based on available information,
it was assumed for the purposes of this model that as much as 6.6% of mercury could be released in the air from a lamp broken
during the collection, storage and transport of mercury-containing lamps in garbage trucks. The Agency recognizes
that it is uncertain how much mercury is released from broken lamps. The amount of mercury released would vary depending
on the ambient air temperature, the time the broken lamps are directly exposed to the air and the number of lamps broken.
The Agency requests any available data concerning releases of mercury during storage, transportation and waste
management (e.g., landfill and recyclers) activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Technical Considerations and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The available data on landfill leachate suggests that mercury-containing lamps may not pose a threat to groundwater
when placed in a state-controlled municipal landfill due to the low levels of mercury found in landfill leachate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, available information also indicates that an important route of exposure for mercury is bioaccumulation
up the food chain, causing mercury poisoning to both wildlife and humans (i.e., through fish consumption). Although
it is unclear how mercury moves through the atmosphere and what conditions enhance or retard it, information suggests
that given the high vapor pressure of mercury, it can readily volatilize to the air and be transported, perhaps long
distances, and be deposited on surface water or soil (which can run off into surface water). Some mercury that is subsequently
methylated will bioaccumulate in the food chain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual amount of mercury released from fluorescent or HID lamps is unknown. It is estimated that lamps that are
incinerated will release 98% of their mercury due to the high temperatures needed for the incineration process. However,
because mercury is such a volatile metal, amounts of mercury could be released into the air from lamps broken during
transportation or lamps broken at the landfill. For purposes of this proposal, EPA has made assumptions on the amount
of mercury that may be released from a broken lamp but few studies have directly measured the amount of mercury released
from a lamp over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More information on the air release, transport and exposure pathway for mercury is needed in order to better evaluate
the proper management methods for spent mercury-containing lamps. The Agency requests information on air transport
of mercury from mercury-containing lamps, the mercury methylation process (both in general and in landfills) and
any studies that directly measure the amount and form of mercury released from broken mercury-containing lamps.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Management Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information presented in this notice has led the Agency to re-evaluate the management of waste mercury-containing
lamps because of their importance in promoting energy-efficiency. As mentioned earlier in this notice, the use of
energy-efficient lighting can reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants as well as emissions of carbon
dioxide and sulfur oxide. In light of the benefits derived from the use of these lamps, EPA is seeking comment on two
proposed options based the data which indicate that these lamps may be better managed either outside of the hazardous
waste system or in a reduced regulatory structure within the hazardous waste system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since there remain uncertainties in the data, more information on the air exposure pathway for mercury from
lamps would facilitate a decision by EPA on the management of lamps. Additional information could clarify which kind
of reduced management structure would be most appropriate for mercury-containing lamps. The Agency has requested
that information, if available, be submitted with the public comment to this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these technical uncertainties, EPA has developed two proposed alternative approaches for the management
of mercury-containing lamps. The first approach is a conditional exclusion for mercury-containing lamps from regulation
as hazardous waste. Under this approach, mercury-containing lamps would no longer be considered hazardous waste
provided that they are managed under the conditions of the exclusion. The second approach is to add mercury-containing
lamps to the universal waste management system, which was proposed for batteries and pesticides on February 11, 1993
(58 FR 8102). Under the universal waste management system, lamps that fail the TC would be considered hazardous waste,
but they would be subject to streamlined hazardous waste management requirements, which are described in detail
later in this notice. The major difference between these two options is whether lamps are disposed of under Subtitle
D requirements or under Subtitle C requirements. Recycling of lamps would be allowed under either option.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If EPA concludes, after considering data from the public comment on this proposal, that the risk from mercury release
from mercury-containing lamps is not significant enough to warrant Subtitle C regulation, the Agency may choose
to finalize a conditional exclusion. However, if EPA concludes, after considering data received in public comment
that the risk from mercury release from lamps is significant, the Agency may choose to keep mercury-containing lamps
in Subtitle C, under the universal waste management system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections describe the two approaches in detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Conditional Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3001 of RCRA charges EPA with identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste and listing particular
hazardous wastes. Section 1004(5) of RCRA defines waste as ``hazardous'' if the waste poses a ``substantial present
or potential hazard'' to human health or the environment when improperly managed. The groundwater data discussed
earlier in this notice suggest that mercury-bearing lamps, if they are disposed of according to the conditions of
the proposed exclusion, may not pose a substantial present or future threat to human health or the environment. Based
on the Agency's authority to identify characteristics of hazardous waste and the statutory definition of hazardous
waste, EPA is considering whether an exclusion of used mercury-containing lamps from regulation as hazardous waste
would be appropriate. EPA requests comment on the data presented in the proposal, as well as on whether to exclude these
lamps from regulation as hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion under consideration today has two conditions. In order to qualify for the exclusion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(a) Generators would be required to either dispose of these lamps in a municipal solid waste landfill that is permitted
by a State/Tribe with an EPA-approved MSW permitting program, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If generators do not send these lamps to a MSW landfill, they would send them to a State permitted, licensed, or registered
mercury reclamation facility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Generators would be required to keep a record of the lamps shipped to management facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to limit the exclusion to spent lamps disposed in MSW landfills (requirements of MSW landfills
are discussed later in this section), rather than allowing disposal in any nonhazardous waste landfill, because
EPA has field data on leachate (including mercury levels) only for MSW landfills (among Subtitle D facility categories).
The available information (discussed above) suggests that the amount of mercury from mercury-containing lamps
that is released from MSW landfill gas is very small and its effect on ambient air quality may not pose a significant
hazard to human health or the environment. EPA requests any information on the levels and impacts of mercury in MSW
landfill gas. Further, data on leachate quality and air emissions from other nonhazardous waste landfills, including
industrial solid waste landfills, is very limited. However, some soil column data also suggest that mercury dissolution
into soil pore water occurs at very low levels (Eichholz et al., 1986). EPA requests comment on this approach and any
information on mercury releases from other nonhazardous waste landfills. Based on EPA's existing data and any additional
data received, EPA may expand the exclusion to include disposal in non-municipal, solid waste, Subtitle D disposal
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this proposed exclusion from Subtitle C of RCRA is supported by data from municipal solid waste landfills with
a range of design and operating conditions, EPA believes that limiting the exclusion to spent lamps disposed only
in MSW landfills that are permitted by States or Tribes with EPA-approved MSW landfill permitting programs will provide
further assurance that human health and the environment will be protected. In particular, these MSW landfill permitting
controls will provide added protection to the management of these lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1991, EPA promulgated new requirements for municipal solid waste landfills (40 CFR Part 258, October 9,
1991, 56 FR 51016). These requirements cover location restrictions, landfill design and operations, groundwater
monitoring, corrective action measures, financial assurance, and conditions for closing the landfill and post
closure care. The majority of landfill owners/operators accepting greater than 100 tons per day must comply with
the majority of the requirements by October 9, 1993. On October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51536), EPA delayed the October 9, 1993
effective date for six months for landfills accepting less than 100 tons per day (in addition to other criteria) and
delayed the effective date for two years for landfills in arid or remote regions that accept less than 20 tons per day.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States/tribes are in the process of incorporating these new municipal solid waste landfill standards into their
permitting programs and applying for EPA approval of their permitting programs. EPA is currently evaluating these
State permitting programs to determine their adequacy in incorporating the new municipal solid waste landfill criteria
(40 CFR part 258). As of June 30, 1993, EPA approved thirty-six State municipal solid waste landfill programs. In addition,
EPA is actively reviewing numerous State permitting program applications and expects to approve the remaining State
landfill permitting programs by April 1994, well before this proposed rule would become effective as a final rule.
EPA expects to issue ``partial'' program approvals to some States because their landfill permitting programs may
not fully address all elements of the EPA municipal solid waste landfill criteria. For purposes of today's rule, EPA
would consider ``partial'' program approvals, as well as ``full'' program approvals, to be ``EPA-approved'' State
municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs. Further, States with ``partial'' approval have agreed to an
EPA approved schedule for full approval. The Agency believes that limiting today's proposed exclusion to landfills
that are permitted by States that have incorporated EPA's new municipal landfill standards will provide further
assurance that spent lamps will be safely managed in municipal solid waste landfills. EPA requests comment on this
approach and any alternative approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second condition, which limits the proposed exclusion to lamps managed in State permitted, licensed, or registered
mercury reclamation facilities, is also consistent with the Agency's support for environmentally sound reclamation
of waste. EPA believes that with adequate State oversight, mercury containing lamps can be safely recycled and the
mercury reclaimed from them. However, EPA is concerned that, in States without oversight over recyclers, recycling
activities could pose a threat to human health and the environment because of inadequate or non-existent waste management
controls. Therefore, the Agency is requesting information on recycling operations and practices. EPA is aware that
several technologies are available to recycle lamps and recover mercury from them. However, the Agency does not have
complete information on which technologies are currently being used by recycling companies and if these technologies
can address all different kinds of lamps (e.g., tube, U-shaped, compact, etc.). The Agency also seeks information
that tracks mercury as it moves through the recycling process. Further, EPA would like to know the operating capacity
of existing or planned reyclers of mercury-containing lamps. The Agency is also requesting information on what markets
exist for the mercury and other materials recovered from lamps. This information will be useful to the Agency in understanding
and assessing possible risks to human health and the environment as well as to determine the potential or actual use
of the materials recovered from lamps in the market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditional exclusion, regulated lamp generators (i.e., those that generate more than the conditional-exempt
small quantity generator (CESQG) limit of 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month which would be about 350 mercury-containing
lamps) would not be able to send lamps to a municipal waste combustor for disposal. EPA does not propose to extend the
exclusion to lamps disposed in municipal waste combustors because of concern over mercury air emissions from these
sources. However, this proposed option would not affect municipal waste combustors' ability to continue the combustion
of traditional municipal solid waste which contains limited quantities of unregulated household or CESQG mercury-containing
lamps. Because mercury-containing lamps do not burn, it is unlikely that truck loads of mercury-containing lamps
(i.e., containing more than 350 lamps) would have been acceptable to most operators. The exclusion would assure that
this disposal alternative is not considered in any situation. The Agency requests comment on the proposal to limit
the exclusion to permitted municipal solid waste landfills (i.e., regulated lamp generators would not be allowed
to send lamps to a municipal waste combustor for disposal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also requests comment on adding to the exclusion handling requirements to minimize mercury emissions during
storage and transportation (e.g., packaging to reduce breakage). These management controls could be the same as
those proposed in the universal waste management system. The Agency is interested in data on the cost of and human health
protection provided by these handling requirements for lamps.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third condition is that generators taking advantage of the exclusion would be required to maintain a written certification
indicating the disposal or recycling location for the lamps. The proposed certification, to be signed by the generator
or its authorized representative, would state that on a specified date a specified amount of lamps was consigned to
a specified transporter for disposal or recycling at a specified facility. This certification would be required
for each shipment of lamps and would be maintained by the generator for three years from the date of shipment. The Agency
is proposing this documentation as a mechanism for verifying that the conditions of the exclusion have been met. Failure
to maintain the required documentation would disqualify the generator from eligibility for the exclusion. The existence
of the certification, however, would not protect a generator from an enforcement action if the lamps were not actually
disposed of or recycled in accordance with the conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing that separate documentation be required for each shipment based on its belief that most lamp
generation is sporadic (every three to four years), as opposed to on-going generation which would lead to a continuous
relationship with the same disposal or recycling facility. Given that the life span of mercury-containing lamps
is approximately three to four years, businesses that participate in mass relampings would only dispose of their
lamps every few years. Under the current hazardous waste regulations, many of these businesses would be subject to
hazardous waste regulation because mass relamping could cause them to exceed the conditionally-exempt small quantity
generator level (approximately 350 four foot lamps, if lamps are the only hazardous waste generated). However, small
businesses and other facilities that generate just under the CESQG limit of hazardous waste (100 kg per month) may
exceed this limit with attrition relamping. For these generators, this recordkeeping requirement could be more
burdensome. The Agency requests comments on whether there are alternative mechanisms that can be used by generators
to demonstrate compliance with the conditions of the exclusion. The Agency also requests comment on whether, if the
Agency determines that documentation is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the conditions, the form and frequency
of documentation proposed are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to requesting comment on the conditions of the exclusion, the Agency requests comment on having a 3 to 5
year sunset provision on the exclusion. A sunset provision would require the Agency to re-evaluate the exclusion
after a period of three to five years, to determine whether an exclusion is indeed appropriate for lamps given any unanticipated
management or risk issues that develop as a result of the exclusion. The Agency would then determine whether to extend
the exclusion.

Finally, the Agency requests comments on other alternatives that still achieve the overall RCRA goal of protection

and the Agency will consider such options.

B. Universal Waste Management System

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widely-generated
hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection
and proper management (the ``universal wastes'' proposal, 58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure,
known as a special collection system, is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted
in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators
of these wastes. See the February 11, 1993 preamble discussion, for a detailed discussion of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general waste types that EPA believes may be appropriately managed under this streamlined regulatory structure
are known as ``universal wastes'' and share several characteristics. These wastes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are frequently generated in a wide variety of settings other than the industrial settings usually associated
with hazardous wastes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are generated by a vast community, the size of which poses implementation difficulties for both those who are
regulated and the regulatory agencies charged with implementing the hazardous waste program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;May be present in significant volumes in the municipal waste stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 11, 1993, proposal included specific regulatory text addressing the management of two waste types;
hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or canceled hazardous waste pesticides that are recalled. The proposal
also included a petition process and a set of criteria to be used to determine whether it would be appropriate to add
additional waste types to the special collection system in the future. Several waste types such as automotive antifreeze,
paint application wastes, and mercury-containing items such as thermostats and thermometers were discussed as
possible additions to the Universal Waste proposal, also referred to as the special collection system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2. Universal Waste System Alternative for Lamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 11, 1993, proposal EPA mentioned fluorescent lamps (58 FR 8110), explaining that the Agency was examining
the risks of managing these wastes in landfills and requesting data on the risks of various management methods for
these wastes. Comments received in response to that request are included in the docket for this proposal. The Agency
will respond to these comments in the final rule together with those submitted in response to Today's proposal. The
Agency is requesting comment on using the proposed special collection system for the management of spent lamps as
another approach to the management of mercury-containing lamps. The Agency has not yet promulgated a final universal
waste rule but anticipates doing so in the near future. Should EPA select the universal waste option for lamps as a final
rule, the Agency will ensure consistency with the more comprehensive universal waste final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that spent lamps may appropriately be considered ``universal wastes'' in that they are generated
in a wide variety of settings, are generated by a very large number of generators, and are present in significant volumes
in the municipal waste stream. The special collection system approach may be an appropriate option for addressing
the collection phase of managing lamps that are hazardous waste. The special collection system approach (which is
consistent with the February 11, 1993 proposal), would not change any of the requirements applicable to the ultimate
treatment and disposal or recycling of any wastes collected, but would minimize the regulatory requirements applicable
to collection of these wastes (i.e., generation, transportation, and intermediate storage/consolidation) for
proper management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special collection system regulations also could remove some existing barriers to management of hazardous waste
lamps under the Subtitle C system by reducing the technical and paperwork requirements applicable to collection,
thus making collection more efficient and economical. At the same time, management requirements included in special
collection system regulations could be designed to minimize the hazards posed in collection of these wastes (e.g.,
special packaging could be required to minimize the risk of breakage).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By removing some of the barriers to Subtitle C management for lamps, a special collection system approach could minimize
concerns about decreased participation in the Green Lights program by simplifying and clarifying the requirements
for mercury-containing lamp collection while maintaining Subtitle C control over final treatment and disposal
(or recycling) for these lamps. Such an approach could help in assuring that the substantial environmental benefits
offered by the Green Lights program are realized through increased participation. Management costs under the special
collection system approach proposed on February 11, 1993, would be lower than full Subtitle C management because
hazardous waste transporters and manifests would not be required for lamp shipments between the generator and the
consolidation facility, and permits would not be required for storage at interim consolidation points. However,
under the Special Collection System the management of mercury-containing lamps (after reaching the consolidation
point) would be more expensive than the management of these lamps under the conditional exclusion (although the larger
volumes managed at these consolidation points may result in certain economies of scale for transport and disposal
or recycling). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on whether spent hazardous waste lamps should be regulated under the special collection
system approach proposed February 11, 1993. Documents included in the docket for this proposal include estimates
indicating that approximately 3.9 billion spent lamps of all types may be disposed of annually in the country (including
550 million spent fluorescent lamps) and that lighting is one of the second largest contributors of mercury to the
municipal waste stream (from all types of mercury-containing lamps). In addition, the Agency believes that spent
mercury-containing lamps of some type must be generated by almost every commercial and industrial establishment
in the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a special collection system approach could address all types of spent lamps that fail the toxicity characteristic
and are therefore hazardous waste, not only mercury-containing lamps. Such an approach seems appropriate since
any type of waste lamp is likely to be ``universal'' in nature. The Agency requests comment on whether various types
of spent lamps (e.g., incandescent, neon), other than mercury-containing lamps, typically fail the TC test (or exhibit
other characteristics) and would be hazardous waste under the current RCRA Subtitle C toxicity characteristic (40
CFR 261.24). Indeed, should the Agency choose, in a final rule, to conditionally exempt mercury-containing lamps
from regulation under Subtitle C, the Agency may still elect to add other types of lamps to the universal waste management
system. The Agency requests comment on this approach and on whether, how frequently, and for what TC constituents
various lamp types may fail the toxicity characteristic. The Agency also requests that commenters submit any additional
data that may be available on this question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on a special collection system for management of spent lamps including the same basic
structure and requirements for generators, transporters, consolidation points, and destination facilities as
proposed on February 11, 1993 for management of hazardous waste batteries and pesticides. The Agency is also specifically
requesting comment on the items discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in the February 11, 1993, proposal the Agency proposed a quantity limit for storage of batteries above which
generators and consolidation points would be required to notify the Agency of their storage activities. The Agency
requests comment on a notification requirement for generators and consolidation points storing more than 35,000
spent mercury-containing lamps. This requirement is similar in substance to the notification requirement proposed
in the Universal Wastes rule (proposed &sect;273.11(c) and &sect;273.13(d) (58 FR 8129&hyph;8130)). EPA is suggesting
a numerical limit rather than a weight limit because lamp packaging (e.g., the cardboard boxes in which new replacement
lamps were shipped) may constitute a large proportion of the total weight of a shipment or stored quantity of lamps.
In addition, industry practice appears to be to quantify inventories by number of lamps rather than by weight, calculated
by multiplying the number of boxes of lamps in storage or in a shipment by the number of lamps per box. Since about 35,000
lamps roughly correspond to a full truckload of packaged fluorescent lamps, the Agency is suggesting a 35,000 limit
for fluorescent lamps. The Agency also requests comment on appropriate quantity limits for notification for other
hazardous waste lamps types.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Agency is requesting comment on the options proposed in the Universal Waste proposal &sect;273.11(b)(2)
and &sect;273.13(a)(2) (58 FR 8129&hyph;8130) for demonstrating that lamps are not stored for greater than one year.
In addition, with respect to tracking of lamp shipments, the Agency is requesting comment on several alternatives.
The approach included in today's proposed regulatory text is the same as that included in the universal wastes proposal
for batteries (&sect;273.12(b) of the universal waste proposal). This approach requires that the manifest system
be used (which triggers the use of hazardous waste transporters) for shipments from the last consolidation point
to a destination facility, but that no manifests or other records (or hazardous waste transporters) be required for
shipments from generators to consolidation points, between consolidation points, or from generators to destination
facilities. On the other hand, because a number of comments received on the proposed universal wastes rule disagreed
with this approach, the Agency is also requesting comment on two additional approaches. The first alternative, which
was suggested in several comments on the universal wastes rule, would be to require that persons initiating and receiving
shipments of lamps retain shipping papers documenting the shipments. The minimum data elements required for such
records could be specified (e.g., quantity of lamps, date of shipment or receipt, name and address of shipper and receiver).
The second alternative would be not to specifically require any specific record keeping for shipments of lamps, but,
as with all exemptions, the person claiming the exemption would have to keep documentation to show they qualify (see
&sect;261.2(f)). The Agency is requesting comment on this second alternative because it is believed that due to the
large volumes of lamps, shipments are more likely to be made directly from the generator to a destination facility.
Records would be available for such shipments because destination facilities are already required under 40 CFR 264.73(b)(1)
or 265.73(b)(1) to maintain records including the description and quantity of each hazardous waste received. It
is likely that lamps would be shipped directly from generators to disposal facilities because volumes are likely
to be large enough that consolidation will not be necessary to make full truckloads. In addition, the storage space
and careful handling required for management of these wastes make consolidation less attractive and shipment directly
to the destination facility more likely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third question on which the Agency requests comment is what management controls would be appropriate to impose on
collection of lamps under a special collection system approach. Some of the data included in the docket for this proposal
discuss the risks of the types of management likely in lamp collection such as management at the generator's site,
transportation, and storage (U.S. EPA, 1993a). Requirements could include packaging that would be required to meet
a performance standard of minimizing breakage for unbroken spent lamps. A wide variety of containers would probably
satisfy such packaging requirements. EPA expects that packaging in which new replacement lamps are shipped from
the manufacturer would frequently be reused to store and transport removed, used lamps. Another option could be to
impose a prohibition on intentional breakage of spent lamps by generators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, requirements could be imposed on the storage and transportation of spent lamps that are inadvertently
broken, to prevent further mercury emissions. Steel 55-gallon drums or any enclosed container could be used to hold
broken lamps for transportation to the disposal site. In summary, the Agency requests comment on whether the exclusion
should include requirements to minimize mercury emissions during storage and transportation of spent lamps. Management
standards would apply to transporter and consolidation points as well as for generators. The Agency requests comment
on management practices for lamps, the risks posed by these practices, and appropriate technical controls to minimize
these risks while at the same time not inhibiting collection and proper management. The Agency also requests comment
on whether generators or consolidation points should be allowed to intentionally crush lamps to minimize volume
for storage or shipment and what, if any, standards should be imposed to protect against mercury releases during crushing
or the subsequent management of crushed lamps. The proposed universal waste management system includes a prohibition
on treatment (crushing is considered treatment) of lamps at the generator, transporter and consolidation points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth question on which the Agency requests comment is whether to include a 3 to 5 year sunset provision on the universal
waste system for lamps. A sunset provision will require EPA to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the universal waste
system in addressing the disposal of lamps after 3 to 5 years. The Agency can then decide whether less controls or more
controls are needed to maintain the safe management of lamps and whether to extend the inclusion of lamps in the universal
waste system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program with the
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA
retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary
enforcement responsibility. The standards and requirements for authorization are found at 40 CFR part 271.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a State with final authorization administered its
hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements
no longer applied in the authorized State and EPA could not issue permits for any facility in the State that the State
was authorized to permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was
obliged to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect
in an authorized State until the authorized State adopted the requirements as State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA
take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to
implement HSWA requirements and prohibitions in an authorized State, including the issuance of permits, until the
State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain
final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Effect on State Authorizations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditional exclusion and the universal waste management system would not be HSWA regulations, and thus would
not be immediately effective in authorized States. Thus, the exemption would be applicable only in those States that
do not have final authorization for the base (non-HSWA) portion of the RCRA program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose more stringent regulations than the Federal program. Accordingly, authorized
States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgates Federal regulations that are more stringent
than the authorized State regulations. For those changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal
program, States are not required to modify their programs. Today's proposed options are considered less stringent
or smaller in scope than the existing Federal regulations because that portion of today's proposal would exempt certain
activities now within the purview of RCRA Subtitle C. Therefore, authorized States are not required to modify their
programs to adopt regulations consistent with and equivalent to the proposed exclusion or the proposed universal
waste management system for lamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though States will not be required to adopt today's proposed options (if either is finalized), EPA would encourage
States to do so. As already explained in the preamble, a conditional exclusion of mercury-containing lamps or the
addition of lamps to the universal waste management system could reduce barriers to participation in EPA's Green
Lights program, which encourages pollution prevention through energy savings. Further, it could help to clarify
for the regulated community the proper management of mercury-containing lamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed options, by making regulations less stringent for management of lamps, would give States
more freedom to develop programs for lamp disposal that would be appropriate for their situation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order No. 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, this section of the preamble summarizes the costs (savings) and the
economic impact analysis of (option 1) the proposed mercury-containing lamp exclusion and of (option 2) the proposed
special collection of mercury-containing lamps. Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's rule, the Agency's
best estimate is that the exclusion of mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C hazardous waste regulatory requirements
(option 1) may result in nationwide annualized savings of approximately $93 million, and the special collection
of mercury containing lamps (option 2) may result in a nationwide annualized savings of approximately $17 million.
A complete discussion of the economic impact analysis is available in the regulatory docket for today's proposed
rule (EPA, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests information to better evaluate the human health and environmental effects of the two options
described in this notice and current disposal practices. Human and environmental exposure to mercury could occur
during the collection, transportation, processing, recycling, treatment, and disposal of spent lamps. EPA estimated
the potential mercury air emissions resulting from some of these activities, but is uncertain about the extent and
likelihood of human and environmental exposure. The Agency is also aware that the two regulatory options may pose
different worker and transportation injury risks as well as different environmental risks. The Agency requests
information on the overall risks to human health and the environment associated with current practices and the two
proposed options.

A. Compliance Costs (Savings) for Regulatory Options Considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section briefly describes (1) the universe of spent mercury-containing lamps and lamp generators, (2) the current
regulatory baseline and (3) the major options for the regulation of spent mercury-containing lamps included in today's
proposal for consideration. Descriptions of the baseline and the major options also include a summary of the methodology
used in estimating compliance costs (savings). Results of the analysis are summarized in section 5.

1. Universe of Spent Lamps and Spent Lamp Generators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency estimates that approximately 310 to 380 million mercury-containing lamps, and 47,000 to 64,000 facilities
could be affected annually by today's proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spent lamp generation number is based on sales data,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 adjusted to account for (1) Lamps generated by Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG), which would
not be affected by either one of the proposed options, and (2) lamps generated in States where spent bulb management
regulations exist (California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). (It was assumed that these State controls would be more
stringent than the options considered in today's proposal and would therefore supersede any Federal exemption of
spent mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C requirements).

2. Baseline Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA assumed that baseline requirements are the continuation of current Subtitle C regulatory standards for the treatment
and disposal of mercury-containing lamps which currently fail the TC. Under this scenario, generators of spent mercury
containing lamps which fail the TC continue to be subject to the full spectrum of hazardous waste management standards
including record keeping and manifesting of all mercury-containing lamp shipments, Agency notification and Subtitle
C transport, treatment, storage and disposal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cost analysis, all spent mercury-containing lamps were assumed to be TC (Toxicity Characteristic) hazardous
wastes. All spent lamps were also assumed to be in the low risk category for mercury, requiring stabilization as treatment
under the Land Disposal Restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost drivers for the baseline management of spent lamps include hazardous waste transportation, and Subtitle C disposal.
The bulk of mercury-containing lamps currently disposed (97%) are assumed to be stabilized and disposed of in hazardous
waste landfills. The remainder, based upon volume data from the spent mercury-containing lamp recovery industry,
are recycled. Based upon conversations with the recycling industry, which indicate planned increases in recycling
capacity, the analysis assumed a small annual increase in the baseline recycling rate of mercury-containing lamps
over the first three years of the analysis. Unit costs for stabilization, landfilling, recycling and hazardous waste
transport were applied on a per ton basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generator specific requirements which applied to all large quantity generators of spent mercury-containing lamps
included record-keeping, manifesting, exception reporting, and BRS (Biennial Reporting System) reporting. Other
generator requirements, including rule familiarization, notification, personnel safety training and emergency
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 planning were only assessed for new facilities which spot relamp and store (up to 90 days for large quantity generators;
up to 180 days for small quantity generators) spent lamps on site. It is assumed that costs resulting from generator
requirements which are incurred on a per shipment basis (i.e. manifesting, exception reporting) will be incurred
by group relampers once every three years (once per relamp). Spot relampers will incur these costs twice a year (for
small quantity generators) or four times per year (for large quantity generators).

According to 40 CFR part 265 Subpart D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, all large quantity generators
of hazardous waste must draft a contingency plan describing the actions facility personnel will take should a fire,
explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden releases of hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface
water occur. Local emergency response teams use the information required in the contingency plan to minimize unanticipated
damage from the storage of hazardous waste.

3. Option 1: Conditional Exclusion From Subtitle C Standards Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first option under consideration in today's proposal is to exclude mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C
management standards with the condition that these lamps are managed in permitted municipal landfills or recycling
facilities. The proposed exclusion also includes a minor generator record keeping requirement. As the exclusion
would be deregulatory, primary economic impacts to small and large quantity generators of mercury-containing lamps
resulting from this action would be in the form of cost savings from avoided Subtitle C regulatory management, particularly
for transport and disposal of spent lamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cost analysis, it was assumed that, given the proposed conditional exclusion, all small and large quantity
generators of spent mercury-containing lamps would opt for management in municipal landfills in order to reduce
disposal costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some generators may have slightly higher disposal costs than others as a result of the proposed exclusion of mercury-containing
lamps from municipal combustors. If these generators currently manage their non-hazardous waste in municipal combustors,
the combustor exclusion may require these generators to: (1) Keep their spent lamps separate from the rest of their
municipal solid waste, (2) store spent lamps on site until enough volume has been generated to make disposal cost effective,
and (3) haul spent lamps greater distances to municipal solid waste landfills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, overall savings to be accrued from the proposed exclusion may vary slightly from generator to generator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Option 2: Special Collection Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second option, special collection, included in today's proposal would allow small and large quantity generators
of spent mercury-containing lamps to reduce certain administrative activities required under Subtitle C standards,
including biennial reporting, notification, manifesting and personnel training. Additionally the option also
allows generators to store spent mercury-containing lamps on-site for up to one year without a hazardous waste permit,
and to transport their spent lamps direct to final disposal or recycling using non-hazardous waste haulers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The option also includes similar reduced requirements for interim spent lamp storage facilities and ``special collection
centers.'' Transportation to these facilities or centers from the generator would not be regulated under Subtitle
C standards, however, transport to final disposal or recycling from these facilities would be regulated under Subtitle
C standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs estimated for Special Collection Option assumes for urban generators direct shipment using non-hazardous
waste haulers, as allowed under this option, from generators to final disposal; thus the costs of creating and operating
an interim storage facility or special collection center are not included for urban generators. The rationale for
this omission is twofold: (1) It is assumed that spent lamp generation is large enough to create economies of scale
for direct non-hazardous waste transport; the need for special collection centers is precluded by non-hazardous
waste transport ``milk runs'' for spent lamps, and (2) although there may be economies of scale generated for long-haul
transport of spent lamps from collection centers, the special collection option requires Subtitle C transport from
the centers to final disposal or recycling, thus making the use of a collection center with Subtitle C final transport
more expensive than Subtitle D direct transport to the disposal facility.

National Annualized Costs (Savings).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A summary of estimated national annual compliance costs associated with the exclusion option and the special collection
option, along with estimated baseline compliance costs are presented below in exhibit VII.1. Also presented are
estimated incremental savings above baseline compliance costs for each option. Costs were annualized over a twenty-year
period, using a 7% discount rate. The analysis used projected growth in the U.S. population over the twenty-year time
frame of the analysis to estimate the increase in growth of spent lamp generation. Total estimated annualized savings
range between approximately $85 million and $102 million for the exclusion and savings estimates for the special
collection option range between $16 million and $20 million in savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above savings estimate is based on the assumption in the baseline that all facilities are properly managing their
mercury-containing spent lamps as Subtitle C waste. Currently, however, some lamp generators may not be aware that
fluorescent lamps are hazardous waste and therefore may not be following Subtitle C requirements. Hence, estimated
savings may represent savings from a future scenario of full compliance with current law, rather than savings from
current lamp management. EPA expects that if no regulatory action is taken, Subtitle C management of mercury-containing
lamps will become more prevalent over the next few years.

Savings Per Waste Lamp Generated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As with average savings per generator estimates, average savings per waste lamp generated were derived by simply
dividing total upper and lower bound costs (savings) by the estimated number of waste lamps accounted for by small
and large quantity generators in states without specific spent lamp management standards. The average baseline
Subtitle C cost per bulb is estimated to be $.34 to $.36. The resulting savings per lamp is estimated at $.27 per bulb
for the conditional exclusion option (both high and low savings scenario) and at $.05 per bulb for the special collection
option. Again, cost per bulb may vary significantly due to site specific factors.

6. Sensitivity Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section presents the results of EPA's analysis of the effects of varying selected major parameters in the cost
analysis (where the Agency used considerable judgment in arriving at the parameter's value) on the estimated savings
incurred under the proposed conditional exclusion and the proposed Universal Waste Rule. The following assumptions
were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis for EPA's analysis of spent lamp management costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Percentage of Lamps Generated at Small and Large Quantity Generators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the sensitivity analysis, EPA set its lower bound estimates of the percentage of lamps generated at SQGs and LQGs
at fifty percent of total spent lamp generation and its upper bound estimates at ninety percent. (Seventy-five percent
was used in the initial cost analysis).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) Cost to Transport Subtitle C Waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the sensitivity analysis, EPA increased the upper bound estimates of the costs of transporting spent lamps as Subtitle
C by a factor of three, based on price quotes from commercial transporters, over original estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) Cost to Dispose of Subtitle C Waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on price quotes from commercial hazardous waste disposal facilities, EPA increased the upper bound estimates
of the Subtitle C disposal costs by a factor of four over original estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(4) Cost of Employee Training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To reflect uncertainty over whether a professional trainer would be required and over how many employees would need
to be trained, EPA increased and decreased the cost of employee training required by 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the high-end scenario were estimated using the upper bound estimates for each cost element
included in the sensitivity analysis. The costs associated with the low-end scenario combined the lower bound estimates
for each cost element. The results from these two analyses suggest that the range of total annual savings from the proposed
condition exclusion for spent lamps could be $65 million to $289 million, and the range of total annual savings from
the proposed Universal Waste RCRA requirements for generators of spent lamps could be $15 million to $39 million.
The range in cost savings is mainly the result of uncertainty over Subtitle C transportation and disposal costs for
lamps. Although EPA has received price quotes for management of lamps as Subtitle C waste that are considerably higher
than the average cost of managing hazardous waste in Subtitle C landfills, it is not appropriate to directly compare
price quotes to engineering costs because the price quotes reflect a constrained market place which tends to inflate
prices well above costs. However, a three-fold difference between the price quotes for spent lamps and standard Subtitle
C management cost may also be due to other factors beyond the inflated prices of the constrained market, including
the low density of lamps (i.e. a ton of lamps has a greater volume than a ton of hazardous waste sludge), or difficulty
in handling lamps. EPA requests comment on the true costs, as well as the reasoning behind these costs, of managing
spent lamps as Subtitle C waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Proposed Rule Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Impacts on Generators of Mercury-Containing Waste Lamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, option 1, the exclusion, is estimated to result in average annual savings per small and large quantity
spent lamp generator ranging from $2,000 to $2,250. Option 2, special collection, is estimated to result in an average
annual per generator savings of approximately $300. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Secondary Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While total incremental savings from the proposed exclusion (option 1) and from the proposed special collection
system (option 2) over a Subtitle C management approach appear to be high, the Agency does not expect significant immediate
shifts in demand or price for the lamps or for products manufactured or sold by firms which consume these lamps due to
the proposed options. Because the impacts to lamp generators are positive (i.e. net savings), the Agency does not
expect the rule to result in adverse impacts to businesses, or to affect employment or international trade to any appreciable
degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that, with the exception of lamps generated in States with existing lamp disposal requirements, most
small and large quantity generators of mercury containing lamps will choose to dispose of their waste lamps in municipal
solid waste landfills under option 1, the proposed exclusion from Subtitle C. This is because Subtitle D disposal
is significantly less expensive per bulb than recycling or Subtitle C disposal.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, most waste lamps currently being handled according to Subtitle C standards by permitted hazardous
waste haulers, disposal sites and spent lamp processing facilities, would be handled by Subtitle D haulers and disposal
facilities. Thus Subtitle C waste haulers, disposal and spent lamp processing facilities would be affected negatively
while Subtitle D haulers and disposal facilities would be affected positively under option 1.

and $1,375 per ton for recycling.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exclusion, option 1, may also have an impact upon mercury-containing lamp processors. The Agency estimates that
there are currently 15 facilities which process spent mercury-containing lamps. Two of these facilities recover
spent mercury through retorting; the remaining 13 facilities separate the glass and aluminum ends, and send the mercury-containing
phosphor powder to the two facilities that retort. Ten of the 15 lamp processing facilities are located in the three
States where spent lamp management regulations exist. Although most recovery facilities are located in States with
stringent State lamp disposal requirements, and would most likely will not be affected by today's proposed exclusion,
a certain percentage of the spent lamps currently recovered at these facilities are generated in States with no specific
lamp disposal requirements. EPA believes that a portion of mercury-containing lamps would no longer be sent for recovery
under the proposed exclusion (option 1) since disposal in municipal landfills would be significantly less expensive.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assuming that lamps generated outside of these States will not be sent for recovery, it is possible that 17 percent,
or 16 million lamps, may be diverted. Using a lamp/revenue ratio for recovery facilities of $.44, total impact to the
industry could be approximately $7 million dollars
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in lost revenues ($469,000 per facility). Future recycling efforts may also be impacted since many of these facilities
may retract plans for expansion in States which currently have no specific lamp disposal requirements.

Under option 2, the proposed special collection system, small and large quantity generators would not be allowed
to choose to dispose of hazardous waste lamps in a municipal solid waste landfill. Thus the above impacts on Subtitle
C waste haulers, disposal and spent lamp processing facilities would not be observed under the second option.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agencies to consider ``small entities'' throughout
the regulatory process. Section 603 of the RFA requires an initial screening analysis to be performed to determine
whether small entities will be affected by the regulation. If affected small entities are identified, regulatory
alternatives must be considered to mitigate the potential impacts. Small entities as described in the Act are only
those ``businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only entities directly subject to today's proposed rule are small and large quantity generators of spent mercury
containing lamps (conditionally exempt small quantity generators are not directly subject to today's proposed
rule). In order to meet the definition of a regulated entity under today's rule, a generator must produce over 100 kg
of spent lamps (350 four foot fluorescent lamps) in a given month. It is conceivable that some of these generators would
meet the definition of ``small business'' as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (i.e. mid-sized firms that
group relamp and generate in excess of 346 spent fluorescent lamps in a given month); however the Agency does not have
an estimate of the number of such ``small entities.'' However, both of the proposed options are expected to result
in net savings to the regulated entities. Option 1, excluding mercury containing lamps from Subtitle C management
standards, is estimated to result in per generator savings of between $2,000 and $2,250 annually. Option 2, managing
spent lamps under a special collection system is estimated to result in an average annual per generator savings of
approximately $300. Thus, since generator impacts are positive for both options, EPA has determined that small regulated
entities will not be adversely impacted, and thus, no ``mitigating'' options are being analyzed in this section.
Hence, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), ``the Administrator certifies
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of entities.''

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under its appropriation for fiscal year (FY) 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389), FEMA was authorized to assess and collect
fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees to recover approximately, but not less than, 100 per centum
of the amounts anticipated by FEMA to be obligated for its Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program. This
appropriations act further provided for the Director of FEMA to promulgate, through rulemaking, a schedule of fees
applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. Public Law 102&hyph;389
provided the authority for these user fees to be assessed and collected for fiscal year 1993 services only. FEMA's
appropriation for FY 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124) continued the user fee provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;389, and
FEMA anticipates that the Congress will provide such authority again in FEMA's appropriation for FY 1995. If such
authority is provided, FEMA proposes to revise its existing interim rule to change for FY 1995 the methodology used
to assess the user fees. One advantage of the proposed change in methodology would be the ability to issue user fee bills
during the first quarter of the fiscal year. This proposed rule is being published at this time in order to publish the
resulting revised rule in time to meet the FY 1995 billing schedule, as well as to notify all potentially affected parties
of this proposed change and to invite and request comments on the proposed revised methodology.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 6, 1991, FEMA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 9452&hyph;9459) the final rule, 44 CFR part 353, that established a structure for assessing and collecting
user fees from NRC licensees. Under 44 CFR part 353, REP services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors were
reimbursable only if these services were site-specific in nature and directly contributed to the fulfillment of
emergency preparedness requirements needed for licensing by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
Although FEMA is proposing a new approach for the assessment and collection of fees from licensees for FY 1995, part
353 remains in effect and will apply in any subsequent fiscal year for which FEMA is not authorized to collect user fees
for generic services.

Public Law 102&hyph;389, October 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1571&hyph;1619, expanded reimbursable REP Program activities
by authorizing FEMA to charge licensees of commercial nuclear power plants fees to recover the full amount of the funds
budgeted for FEMA's REP Program for FY 1993. On July 1, 1993, FEMA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 35770&hyph;35775) an interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, to establish and set forth the policies and administrative
basis for assessing and collecting these fees. FEMA reserved the option of applying, reissuing, or amending part
354 for other fiscal years provided that appropriate authority was enacted. Public Law 103&hyph;124, September
23, 1993, 107 Stat. 1297, directed FEMA to continue assessing and collecting fees to recover the full amount of the
funds budgeted for FEMA's REP Program for FY 1994. In addition, the Administration has proposed assessing such fees
for subsequent fiscal years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the methodology established by the interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, the final hourly user fee rate for FEMA personnel
during FY 1993 was calculated at $122.88. On December 13, 1993, a notice to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 65274). The notice also explained that FEMA would not publish a final rule at that time, pending a reconsideration
of the methodology used for FY 1993, taking into consideration the comments received on interim rule 44 CFR part 354.
The methodology established by the interim rule 44 CFR part 354 was continued in effect for FY 1994 as noticed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 26350) published on May 19, 1994. Although the revised interim rule would, if authorized by FEMA's FY 1995 appropriation,
be restricted to FY 1995, FEMA reserves the option of reissuing or amending part 354 for other fiscal years provided
that appropriate authority is enacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed revision of 44 CFR part 354, fees for FY 1995 would be assessed at a flat rate based on fiscal year
budgeted funds for REP Program services performed by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors whether or not these services
directly support NRC licensing requirements. Under Section 354.4, Assessment of Fees, charges for services would
be determined by dividing the total amount of funds budgeted for the REP Program, i.e., salaries and expenses, including
travel, and Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) funding, by the total number of licensed commercial
nuclear power plant sites benefiting from REP Program services, as defined under &sect;354.2, Scope. The total amount
of funds budgeted for the REP Program would be recovered by dividing the funds equally among the NRC licensees on a per
site basis; thus, all sites will be charged the same flat fee. Under this methodology, site-specific and generic services
would not be distinguished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the comments in response to interim rule 44 CFR part 354 considered by FEMA were those submitted by the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which has now become part of the Nuclear Energy Institute. In its comments,
NUMARC recommended a methodology whereby the hourly rate for FEMA personnel would be determined by dividing that
percentage of the total FEMA Salaries and Expenses budget item attributable to site-specific activities by the total
number of site-specific hours expended. This hourly rate then would be applied only to site-specific activities
performed by FEMA personnel. Site-specific activities performed by contractor personnel would be billed on an actual
cost basis. Finally, under the proposed NUMARC methodology, costs for generic services provided by FEMA personnel
and FEMA contract personnel would be recovered by charging each licensee equally for these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology recommended by NUMARC was considered by FEMA, but the flat fee approach is being proposed instead
because a flat fee would: (1) Provide each licensee with a bill early in the fiscal year, thus facilitating the licensee's
planning and budgeting process by greatly increasing the predictability of the licensee's bill; (2) enable States
and licensees to request needed technical assistance without considering any cost implications associated with
site-specific oriented methodologies; (3) benefit the U.S. taxpayer by earlier deposit of funds in the U.S. Treasury;
and (4) reduce the FEMA resources required to track administrative costs, thus making the accounting and billing
process more efficient and cost-effective for the Government and freeing up FEMA resources for other REP program
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above considerations, FEMA used actual FY 1993 billing data to calculate a flat fee and compared
this with the fees that would have been generated using the methodology proposed by NUMARC. Using FY 1993 data, the
flat fee (for each site) would have been $149,928. Under the proposed NUMARC methodology, the generic portion of the
bill alone for each site would have been $87,702. The site-specific portion, consisting of exercise, plan review,
and other site-specific activities, would be added to this amount for the total bill.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A further comparison of the results of these calculations indicated that, under the proposed NUMARC methodology,
23 sites would have had bills equal to or higher than the flat fee, averaging approximately $90,000 more than the flat
fee. Forty-seven sites would have had bills lower than the flat fee, averaging approximately $42,000 less than the
flat fee. An analysis of the results using the proposed NUMARC methodology also indicated that the size of a site's
bill was, in most instances, directly related to the biennial exercise cycle; i.e., the bill was higher if a site had
an exercise in FY 1993, and the bill was lower if a site had not had an exercise in FY 1993. Thus, a majority of the bills
below the flat fee in FY 1993 would be higher than the flat fee in FY 1994, and vice versa. Over a two-year period the bills
would average out to an amount reasonably close to the flat fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the results of the above calculations, FEMA believes the flat fee to be fair and equitable because (1) although
under the proposed NUMARC methodology, more bills were below the flat fee than were above it, those bills lower than
the flat fee were, on the average, considerably closer to the flat fee than were the bills higher than the flat fee, and
(2) the flat fee would eliminate the extreme year-to-year fluctuation in bill amount due to a site's position in the
exercise cycle, and, thus, each site's bills would be more equitable in size over any given biennial cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEMA's services primarily are provided in support of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the NRC and FEMA
published on September 14, 1993 (58 FR 47996), and regulations issued by both FEMA (44 CFR parts 350, 351, and 352) and
the NRC (10 CFR parts 50 and 52).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Radiological emergency response plans and exercises are evaluated using joint FEMA&hyph;NRC criteria, NUREG&hyph;0654/FEMA&hyph;REP&hyph;1,
Revision 1 and Supplement 1. When State and local governments do not participate in the development of an emergency
plan, the licensee may submit a licensee offsite plan to the NRC. Pursuant to the MOU, the NRC can request that FEMA review
a licensee offsite plan and provide its assessments and findings on the adequacy of such plans and preparedness evaluated
under Supplement 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All funds collected under this proposed rule would be deposited in the U.S. Treasury to offset funds budgeted for FEMA's
REP Program. In response to a FEMA request for a waiver from the Department of Treasury's cash management provisions
of the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000, Section 8025.10, the Department of the Treasury
granted FEMA a waiver from the I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000, Section 8025.10, requirement to bill within five days of service.
A waiver was not granted to allow 45 days for payment of bills by licensees. However, if the authority for the proposed
revised interim rule is enacted, the Department of the Treasury will grant a one-time exemption to the 30 day payment
requirement in order to permit licensees to pay the FY 1995 bill, which would be issued in November 1994, in January
of 1995. Also, the Department of the Treasury requested that the user fee rule provide for the use of electronic billing
and payment mechanisms. FEMA worked with the Department of the Treasury to effect these procedures and now provides
for payment of bills by electronic transfers through Automated Clearing House credit payments. The Department of
the Treasury publication I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000 has been recently revised to require, under section 8025.30, all
funds to be collected by electronic funds transfer when such collection would be cost-effective, practicable, and
consistent with current statutory authority.

for classes of regulated persons and the administrative costs of collecting such fees. Fees received pursuant to
this section shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury as offsetting receipts. Assessment and collection
of such fees are only authorized during fiscal year (FY) 1995.

Assessment of fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessment of fees for licensees will be based on the following methodology that includes, but does not distinguish
between, charges for both site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors. Fees
will be assessed for REP Program services provided by FEMA personnel and by FEMA contractors and not for those services
provided by other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RACs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of charges for services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Charges for services will be determined by dividing the total amount of fiscal year funds budgeted for the REP Program,
i.e., salaries and expenses, including travel, and Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) funding,
by the total number of commercial nuclear power plant sites, as defined under &sect;354.2, Scope. The total amount
of funds budgeted for the REP Program will be recovered by dividing the funds equally among the NRC licensees on a per
commercial nuclear power plant site basis; thus, all sites would be charged the same amount. Under this methodology,
site specific and generic services will not be distinguished.

Upon receipt of official written notification from the NRC that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness
is no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, FEMA will discontinue REP Program services
and will close out the official docket. Commencing with the next fiscal year after closing out the official docket,
user fees will no longer be assessed for that site.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FEMA will forward bills to licensees based on the assessment methodology set forth in &sect;354.4 to recover the full
amount of the funds budgeted by FEMA to provide REP Program services. The assessments for each site and licensee, as
stated above, will not distinguish between site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA
contractors. Licensees with multiple sites will receive consolidated bills. FEMA will forward one bill to each licensee
during the first quarter of the fiscal year, with payment due within 30 days. There will be a one-time adjustment to
the billing cycle in the first quarter of FY 1995 to accommodate a transition to the new methodology. During this quarter,
an adjusted final bill for FY 1994 REP Program services will be issued along with the bill for all of FY 1995, with a possible
second bill if minor adjustments are necessary. In order to avoid having the licensees pay two bills during the same
fiscal year (FY 1994) for activities performed in two different fiscal years, FEMA, with the concurrence of the Department
of the Treasury, will structure the due date of these two bills so that the adjusted bill for FY 1994 will be due and payable
by the end of December 1994 and the full bill for FY 1995 will be due and payable in January of 1995.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule updates the regulations of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
to reflect developments and changes in Committee procedures which have occurred since the regulations were last
substantively revised in 1991, and to include wording changes that were overlooked in that revision. The new revisions
were made necessary by changes in the Government procurement process, of which the Committee's program is a part,
and by the Committee's experiences since 1991, including litigation, which have demonstrated that the regulations
do not always clearly reflect the authorities given the Committee by the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act and other
laws as implemented in its procedures. The proposed rule will enable the JWOD Program to operate more efficiently
to fulfill the Committee's mission of increasing employment opportunities for people with severe disabilities
through the Government procurement process

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Committee's regulations were last substantively amended in 1991 (56 FR 48974, effective October 28, 1991). Those
amendments were the result of the first comprehensive review of the regulations since their promulgation in 1973.
The purpose of the current proposed revision to the regulations is to update them to reflect developments and changes
in procedures since 1991, and to include changes that were overlooked in the last revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the changes to part 51&hyph;2 on Committee responsibilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;51&hyph;2.2(b) has been amended to make clear that the Committee authorizes and deauthorizes both central
nonprofit agencies and nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities to accept
orders from Government agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Committee's program. Section 51&hyph;2.3 is amended to indicate that the Committee publishes notices
of proposed deletions and additions to the Procurement List and to require interested persons who submit bound comments
on these proposals to also submit an unbound copy to be duplicated for staff use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 51&hyph;2.4, 51&hyph;2.7, and 51&hyph;3.2 have been amended to make them consistent with the JWOD Act,
which considers a determination that a commodity or service is suitable for addition to the Procurement List and the
establishment of an initial fair market price for the commodity or service to be two legally separate actions. The
confusing term ``current or most recent contractor'' in &sect;51&hyph;2.4 has been changed to ``current contractor.''
An explanation of those rare instances when ``current contractor'' means ``most recent contractor'' will be addressed
in the Committee's procedural memoranda. The Committee's position that the ``current contractor'' includes affiliated
companies and parent corporations is explicitly stated in the amended &sect;51&hyph;2.4. A provision has been added
to &sect;51&hyph;2.4 to express the Committee's position that its discretion to determine what commodities and
services are suitable for addition to the Procurement List is not totally constrained by the enumerated criteria
in the section. Section 51&hyph;2.7 has also been rewritten to reflect current Committee pricing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;2.5 has been amended to make clear that when the Committee decides that a proposed addition is likely
to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it will decide either to reduce the portion of the Government
requirement for the commodity or service to be added to the Procurement List or will decline to add it. The Committee's
standard for reconsidering a decision to add a commodity or service to the Procurement List, which appears in an internal
memorandum, has been added to &sect;51&hyph;2.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;3.3, which deals with assignment of a commodity or service to a central nonprofit agency for possible
addition to the Procurement List, and &sect;&sect;51&hyph;6.4 and 51&hyph;6.12, which deal with military resale
commodities and specification changes respectively, have been rewritten to clarify their language. Small editorial
changes for clarity have been made in &sect;&sect;51&hyph;4.2 and 51&hyph;5.2. Recordkeeping provisions in &sect;51&hyph;4.3
have been changed to permit acceptance of State certifications of disability to document individuals' disability
status in accordance with recent changes in Federal disability regulations. The section title ``Violations'' used
for both &sect;&sect;51&hyph;4.5 and 51&hyph;5.8 has been changed to indicate that the former applies to violations
of Committee regulations by nonprofit agencies and the latter to violations by entities of the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;5.3, which sets forth the scope of the mandatory procurement source requirement of the JWOD Program,
has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to indicate that the requirement applies to items that are essentially the same as commodities identified
on the Pro curement List by a National Stock Number or other item designation. This change was made necessary by the
increasing number of commercial items in the system which are essentially the same as Procurement List commodities.
A similar change was made in &sect;51&hyph;6.13 on replacement and similar commodities. A new paragraph was added
to &sect;51&hyph;5.3 to set forth the Committee's longstanding policy that Procurement List additions do not affect
contracts in being before the effective date of the addition, or options exercised under those contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum figure for prior Committee approval of purchase exceptions granted by central nonprofit agencies in
&sect;51&hyph;5.4 has been raised from $25,000 to $100,000. The $25,000 figure was set in the 1991 revision of the
Committee regulations to correspond with the Government's small purchase limitation. The new figure corresponds
with the simplified acquisition threshold which is expected to replace the small purchase limitation. Sections
51&hyph;5.5 and 51&hyph;5.6 on prices and shipping of commodities have been amended to allow for pricing and delivery
on an FOB destination basis, consistent with recent developments in Government ordering procedures, as well as the
Committee's traditional FOB origin practice.

Section 51&hyph;6.2 has been amended in paragraph (f) to correct an undetected typographical error in the 1991 amendments.
Section 51&hyph;6.8 on deletions from the Procurement List has been amended by adding a paragraph making it clear
that the Committee can delete a commodity or service from the Procurement List without a request from a central nonprofit
agency. A new paragraph has been added to &sect;51&hyph;6.12 on specification changes to indicate that nonprofit
agencies are to recommend changes that will improve the commodity or service being provided, reduce costs, or improve
overall value to the Government. The paragraph also requires contracting activities to respond promptly to the recommendations.
Section 51&hyph;6.13 has been amended to clarify its language and to indicate that other colors, sizes, or variations
of commodities on the Procurement List which have not been previously procured are considered to be on the Procurement
List as well.

Section 51&hyph;8.3, consisting of definitions applicable only to part 51&hyph;8 on Committee actions under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), has been amended by removing the definition of the Committee, which also appears
in the general definitions for the Committee's regulations at &sect;51&hyph;1.3, and by changing the title ``Chairman''
to ``Chairperson'' as the title of the Committee's presiding officer. The same change to ``Chairperson'' has also
been made in &sect;&sect;51&hyph;8.7, 51&hyph;8.10, 51&hyph;8.11, and 51&hyph;9.405. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes have been made to &sect;&sect;51&hyph;8.1 and 51&hyph;8.4 and to paragraph (a) of &sect;51&hyph;8.5 to
make clear the distinction between material which the Committee is required to make available for public inspection
and material which the Committee provides in response to a FOIA request. The provision in &sect;51&hyph;8.14 for
a minimum amount for FOIA processing costs below which no fee will be charged has been qualified to indicate that the
minimum will apply to each Committee response to a FOIA request where it is necessary to make more than one response
to a request. The Committee bills FOIA requesters separately for each response, which requires a decision each time
as to whether the cost of collection would exceed the amount billed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) In deciding whether or not a proposed addition to the Procurement List is likely to have a severe adverse impact
on the current contractor for the specific commodity or service, the Committee gives particular attention to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The possible impact on the contractor's total sales, including the sales of affiliated companies and parent corporations.
In addition, the Committee considers the effects of previous Committee actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Whether that contractor has been a continuous supplier to the Government of the specific commodity or service
proposed for addition and is, therefore, more dependent on the income from such sales to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any substantive comments received as the result of the notice of the proposed addition in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If there is not a current contract for the commodity or service being proposed for addition to the Procurement
List, the Committee may consider the most recent contractor to furnish the item to the Government as the current contractor
for the purpose of determining the level of impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In determining the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee also
considers other information it deems pertinent, including comments on a proposal published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Committee decision.

The Committee considers the particular facts and circumstances in each case in determining if a commodity or service
is suitable for addition to the Procurement List. When the Committee determines that a proposed addition is likely
to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it takes this fact into consideration in deciding not to add
the commodity or service to the Procurement List, or to add only a portion of the Government requirement for the item.
If the Committee decides to add a commodity or service in whole or in part to the Procurement List, that decision is announced
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

(b) In reconsidering its decision, the Committee will balance the harm to the party requesting reconsideration if
the item remains on the Procurement List against the harm which the nonprofit agency or its employees who are blind
or have other severe disabilities would suffer if the item were deleted from the Procurement List. The Committee may
also consider information bringing into question its conclusions on the suitability criteria on which it based its
original decision as factors weighing toward a decision to delete the item, and information concerning possible
harm to the contracting activity and the JWOD Program as factors weighing toward confirmation of the original decision.

The Committee is responsible for determining the fair market prices, and changes thereto, for commodities and services
on the Procurement List. The Committee establishes the initial fair market price at the time a commodity or service
is added to the Procurement List. In cases where the prices are not based on competitive bids, the Committee considers
recommendations from contracting activities and the central nonprofit agency concerned. Recommendations for
fair market prices or changes thereto shall be submitted by the nonprofit agencies to the appropriate central nonprofit
agency. The central nonprofit agency shall analyze the data and submit a recommended fair market price to the Committee
accompanied by the information required by the Committee's pricing procedures to support the recommended price.

(a) The central nonprofit agencies shall determine by mutual agreement the assignment to one of them of a commodity
or service for the purpose of evaluating its potential for possible future addition to the Procurement List, except
that the Committee shall initially assign a commodity to National Industries for the Blind when NISH has expressed
an interest in the commodity and National Industries for the Blind has exercised the blind priority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) NISH shall provide National Industries for the Blind with procurement information necessary for a decision to
exercise or waive the blind priority when it requests a decision. National Industries for the Blind shall normally
notify NISH of its decision within 30 days, but not later than 60 days after receipt of the procurement information,
unless the two central nonprofit agencies agree to an extension of time for the decision. Disagreements on extensions
shall be referred to the Committee for resolution.

nine months of the notification, unless the Committee extends the assignment period because of delays beyond the
control of National Industries for the Blind. Upon expiration of the assignment period, the Committee shall reassign
the commodity to NISH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The central nonprofit agency assigned a commodity shall obtain a decision from Federal Prison Industries on the
exercise or waiver of its priority and shall submit the procurement information required by Federal Prison Industries
when it requests the decision. Federal Prison Industries shall normally notify the central nonprofit agency of its
decision within 30 days, but not later than 60 days after receipt of the procurement information, unless it agrees
with the central nonprofit agency on an extension of time for the decision. The central nonprofit

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The central nonprofit agency shall provide the Committee the decision of Federal Prison Industries on the waiver

The Service Annual Survey (SAS) is the only annual source of data on the dollar volume of receipts for various service
industries. The data is needed for national income accounting, productivity, and price measurement. The Bureau
of Economic Analysis uses SAS data in its preparation of the national income and product accounts, and its benchmark
and annual input&hyph;output tables. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses the data as input to its Producer Price
Indexes and in developing productivity measurements. Other government agencies use the data for program planning
and development. The SAS provides detailed information on sources of receipts and receipts lines for various industries
such as computer programming, data processing, and other computer related services, management and public relations
services, equipment rental and leasing, automotive rental and leasing, amusement parks, and offices and clinics
of health practitioners.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to announce the proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Cryptographic
Service Calls for Federal agency use. This proposed FIPS specifies a standard interface for application programs
to request cryptographic functions from a cryptographic module. The cryptographic functions include message encryption
and decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation and verification, key management, and user
authentication. The proposed standard supports both secret key and public key algorithms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the announcement
section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications from
the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building,
room B&hyph;64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

7. Objectives. A standard cryptographic interface will facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic
implementations. Specifically, a standard set of cryptographic service calls provides the following advantages:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Application programmers will need to learn only one set of cryptographic service calls for multiple cryptographic
applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cryptographic modules from different vendors, which conform to this interface standard, may be interfaced to
a given application without requiring modification to the application program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Contracts for additional cryptographic modules would not have to be sole sourced because multiple vendors would
offer the standard service calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Vendors could build cryptographic modules which would interface to a wide variety of applications.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Applicability. This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies that use cryptographic-based
security systems for the protection of unclassified information that is not subject to Section 2315 of Title 10, U.S.
Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. The standard shall be used by all Federal departments and agencies
in designing, acquiring and implementing cryptographic services where a cryptographic interface is to be provided.
Not all of the service calls specified in this standard need to be used in its entirety by an application. The specific
service calls that shall be used depend on the security requirements for the particular application and environment
in which the system is to be utilized. Private and commercial organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard
in order to facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applications. The standard may be used in any application which uses cryptography to provide any of the following
cryptographic functions: message encryption/decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation
and verification, and key management. Not all the service calls specified in this standard need to be used by an application.
An application can make use of additional service calls not available in this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Specifications. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) XXX, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cryptographic Service Calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Implementations. Though this document specifies a standard interface for requesting cryptographic functions,
the standard, however, does not mandate a specific implementation of these cryptographic functions other than what
are explicitly specified in the document. The cryptographic functions may in fact be implemented in software, firmware,
hardware, or any combination thereof. However, there may be other standards that are applicable to the implementation
of specific cryptographic functions. For specific requirements, the individual standard shall be referred to.
Conformance to this standard requires that the cryptographic service calls used by an application provide exactly
the same name and letter case for the service calls and their parameters as specified in the standard. In the rare case
where the standard naming and specification of the service calls and parameters may violate certain rules of a particular
programming language in use, the exception should be noted and the selected naming and case specification should
match the standard as much as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Export Control. Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are deemed to be defense articles
(i.e., inherently military in character) and are subject to Federal government export controls as specified in Title
22, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 120&hyph;128. Some exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard
and technical data regarding them must comply with these Federal regulations and be licensed by the U.S. Department
of State. Other exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them fall
under the licensing authority of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department
of Commerce is responsible for licensing cryptographic devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary
software, automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment and software. For advice
concerning which agency has licensing authority for a particular cryptographic device, please contact the respective
agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Implementation Schedule. This standard becomes effective six months after publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of its approval by the Secretary of Commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Qualifications. While this standard specifies a standard interface for application programs to request cryptographic
functions from a cryptographic module, conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular cryptographic
module or implementation is secure. Security requirements for a cryptographic module are addressed in FIPS 140&hyph;1.
The responsible authority in each agency or department shall assure that the overall system provides an acceptable
level of security.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Program Description.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MARFIN is a competitive Federal grant program that promotes and endorses programs that seek to optimize economic
and social benefits from marine fishery resources through cooperative efforts that involve the best research and
management talents to accomplish priority activities. Preference is given to selecting and funding applications
for project grants that provide an opportunity for cooperative NMFS/applicant efforts and for multiple cooperating
applicants/NMFS efforts with up to 3-year time horizons. Projects funded under MARFIN are focused into cooperative
efforts that provide clear answers for fishery needs covered by the NMFS Strategic Plan, available from the Southeast
Regional Office (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), particularly those goals relating to rebuilding overfished marine fisheries, maintaining currently productive
fisheries, and integrating conservation of protected species and fisheries management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications from multiple cooperating applicants that address conservation and management needs over a wide range
of a fishery or fishery organism are encouraged. Emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest
probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors
affecting recruitment success; and/or generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries.
Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-term
research efforts, with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual economic or social benefits that may be realized.
Short-term projects that may yield more immediate benefits, and projects yielding longer-term benefits will receive
equal consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Funding Availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This solicitation announces that funding of approximately $1.25 million may be available in FY 1995 pending Congressional
appropriation. MARFIN financial assistance started in FY 1986, and for FY 1986 through FY 1994, awards totaled about
$15.5 million for financial assistance to conduct research for fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the
South Atlantic states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is no guarantee that sufficient
funds will be available to make awards for all approved projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project proposals accepted for funding for a project period over 1 year that include multiple project components
or severable tasks to be funded each budget period will not compete for funding in subsequent budget periods within
the approved project period. However, funding for subsequent project components is contingent upon the availability
of funds from Congress and satisfactory performance, and will be at the sole discretion of the agency. Publication
of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any parts of
the available funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Matching Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or
donations. Cost-sharing is not required for the MARFIN program. However, cost-sharing is encouraged, and in case
of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of
all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an
applicant chooses to cost-share, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicant will be bound by the
percentage of the cost share reflected in the cooperative agreement award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments, or the value
of in-kind contributions by the applicant or third parties. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share
of matching funds, except as provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited
to, personal services rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and use of real or personal property
owned by others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and the NOAA
Grants Officer and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, time expended and costs incurred in either
the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent discussions or negotiations
prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's cost share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Type of Funding Instrument.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cooperative agreement has been determined to be the appropriate funding instrument. NMFS is substantially involved
in developing program research priorities, conducting cooperative activities with recipients, and evaluating
the performance of recipients for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for fishery research in the
southeastern United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

VIII. Award Period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The award period for the project may be made for more than one year consisting of one, two, or three budget periods which
correspond to the funding for the proposed project components. The award period will depend upon the duration of funding
requested by the applicant in the Application for Federal Assistance, the decision of the NMFS selecting official
on the amount of funding, the results of post-selection negotiations between the applicant and NOAA officials, and
preaward review of the application by NOAA and Department of Commerce (DOC) officials. Normally, each project budget
period may be no more than 18 months in duration. NOAA policy limits the total duration of a project to about 3 years.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies are needed to contribute to the regional shrimp trawler bycatch program being conducted by NMFS in cooperation
with state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and interests, environmental
organizations, universities, Councils, and Commissions. Specific guidance and research requirements are contained
in the Regional Bycatch Plan prepared through the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation. In particular,
the studies should address:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Data collection and analyses to expand and update current bycatch estimates temporally and spatially from offshore,
nearshore, and inshore waters, emphasizing areas of greatest shrimping impact. Sampling effort should include
estimates of numbers, weight, and age structure of the associated bycatch complex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessments of the status and condition of fish stocks significantly impacted by shrimp trawler bycatch, with
emphasis given to overfished species under the jurisdiction of the Councils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Identification, development, and evaluation of gear, non- gear and tactical fishing options to reduce bycatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Longline Fisheries, Including Bycatch
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of pelagic longline fisheries exist in the Gulf and South Atlantic, targeting highly migratory species such
as tunas, some sharks, and swordfish. These fisheries have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with increases in
fishing effort and changes in fishing gear and tactics. These changes need to be characterized and their effects quantified.
High priority areas include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characterization of specific longline fisheries, including targeted species, stock identification, catch-per-unit-effort
of bycatch, and biological parameters (e.g., sex ratios and reproductive state) by gear type, area and season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries, including biological, social, and economic
factors and effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Dependence of vessels and persons engaged in pelagic longlining on other fisheries. Particular emphasis should
be placed on the extent to which the capital and/or labor engages in other fisheries at particular times of the year
and reasons for this switching behavior.

Sharks
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Secretarial FMP for sharks has been developed that identifies a number of research needs, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characterization of the commercial and recreational fisheries from historical and current databases. Emphasis
should be on species composition, bycatch, stock identification, size, sex ratios and catch-per-unit-effort by
season, area, and gear type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Collection and analysis of basic biological data on movements, habitats, growth rates, mortality rates, age
structure and reproduction parameters. These data are of particular importance for blacktip and sandbar sharks.
Information on the relationship of sandbar sharks to water depth and determination of the southern boundary of its
range are specifically needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determination of baseline cost and returns for commercial fisheries that land sharks, and estimation of demand
curves for shark products and recreational shark fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Development of species profiles and stock assessments for sharks taken in significant quantities by commercial
and recreational fishers, and as bycatch in other fisheries. Assessments can be species-specific or for species
groups, following those identified in the Atlantic Sharks FMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Identification of coastal sharks, using laboratory methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Development of a more precise and accurate estimate of the recreational shark fishery. Proposals in this area
must demonstrate a knowledge of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS), and should indicate
a willingness to participate directly in the MRFSS through add-on surveys or enhancement of current surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Development of fishery-independent abundance indices.

Reef Fish
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of species within the reef fish complex are showing signs of being overfished, either by directed efforts
or as bycatch in other fisheries. The ecology of reef fish makes them vulnerable to overfishing because they tend to
concentrate over specific types of habitats with patchy distribution. This behavior pattern can make traditional
fishery statistics misleading. Priority research areas include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Collection of basic biological data for species in commercially and recreationally important fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Age and growth of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Description of age and growth patterns (especially red snapper, gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico
and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Development of annual age-length keys for vermilion snapper in the northern Gulf and west coast central Florida,
and for red grouper in the Gulf, along with new growth models for red grouper that include possible density-dependent
effects, as well as environmental effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reproduction studies of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Maturity schedules and fecundity of commercially and recreationally important reef fish (especially gray triggerfish
and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Detailed histological studies of red snapper to characterize the actual reproductive contribution of females,
by age.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Identification and characterization of spawning aggregations by species, areas, and seasons. Information
is especially needed on changes in sex ratios for gag grouper caused by fishing on spawning aggregations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Reproductive studies covering extensive geographic distributions along the southeastern U.S. coast (North
Carolina through the Florida Keys). Samples should be obtained from recreational (private and headboats) and commercial
vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reproductive biology of gag, red grouper and other grouper species. Of particular importance are evaluation
of sperm limitation, determination of the proximal causes of sex change (whether behavioral or developmental),
determination of the annual periodicity of sex-change induction and age-specific spawning frequency, and other
research identified in the recommendations of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November
1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recruitment of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Source of recruitment in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic waters (especially amberjack and vermilion snapper),
and possible Caribbean source for Florida Keys snapper and grouper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Annual estimation of the absolute or relative recruitment of juvenile gag to the seagrass beds off the west coast
of Florida and to similar estuarine nursery habitats along the South Atlantic Bight; development of an index of juvenile
gag recruitment for the South Atlantic based on historical databases and/or field studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evaluation of the contribution of live-bottom habitat to reef fish recruitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Stock structure of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Movement and migration patterns of commercially and recreationally valuable reef fish species (especially
gag and greater amberjack in the South Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Techniques to allow field separation of lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish from greater amberjack
to facilitate accurate reporting of catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Stock structure of gag and wreckfish in the South Atlantic, and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use of parasitological surveys in species such as wreckfish and white grunt to determine stock structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Behavioral studies of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Description of the behavior of age&hyph;0 and age&hyph;1 red snapper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effects of fishing on reproductive behavior, in formation of aggregations and disruption of existing aggregations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Population assessment of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Effect of reproductive mode and sex change (protogynous hermaphroditism) on population size and characteristics,
with reference to sizes of fish exploited in the fisheries and the significance to proper management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Design of sampling routines to provide a production-style aging program representative of the reef fish fishery.
Effective dock-side sampling programs, especially for groupers, are needed over a wide geographic range to collect
information on reproductive state, size, age, and sex. These research needs are discussed in the report of the workshop
on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Source and quantification of natural and human-induced mortalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of the habitat and limiting factors for important reef fish resources (such as snappers in the Gulf
of Mexico). Information is also needed on the importance of human-created and natural channels for controlling stock
sizes and growth rates of snappers and groupers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Description of habitat and fish populations in the deep reef community and the prey distributions supporting
the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Evaluation of the effect of misidentifying gag as black grouper on landing statistics and stock assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Development of statistically valid indices of abundance for important reef fish species in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico (especially red grouper), including spatial and temporal variations in size distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Assessment of tag performance on reef fish species, mainly snappers and groupers. Characteristics examined
should include shedding rate, effects on growth and survival, and effects of these characteristics on estimations
of vital population parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Stock assessments to establish the status of major recreational and commercial species. Innovative methods
are needed for stock assessments of aggregate species, including the effect of fishing on genetic structure and the
incorporation of sex change for protogynous hermaphrodites into stock assessment models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Fishery-independent assessments of spawning aggregations of gag, scamp, yellowedge and other groupers, using
hydroacoustic and underwater video technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Management of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Research in direct support of management, including catch-and-release mortalities by gear and depth, the value
of limiting longlines to specific water depths (e.g., outside the 50&hyph;fathom (91.4&hyph;m) curve), and modifications
(gear, techniques) to minimize bycatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluation of the use of reef fish marine reserves as an alternative or supplement to current fishery management
measures and practices, especially in the South Atlantic. Of particular interest is Oculina Banks off the Atlantic
Coast of Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Characterization and evaluation of the social and economic behavior of commercial and recreational fishermen,
and how these characteristics change in response to management measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Characterization and quantification of the biological, economic, and social impacts of the longline fishery
for reef fish along the west coast of Florida. This should include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Catch-per-unit-effort of target and bycatch species, and biological parameters (e.g., size, sex, and reproductive
state) by gear type, area, and season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize the bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Coastal Herrings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary studies indicate that substantial stocks of coastal herrings occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most
of the available data are generated from fishery-independent surveys conducted by NMFS and state fishery management
agencies. Because of the size of these stocks, their importance as prey, and in some instances as predator species,
their potential for development as commercial and recreational fisheries must be understood. General research
needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Collection, collation, and analysis of available fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from state
and Federal surveys, with emphasis on species and size composition, seasonal distribution patterns, biomass, bycatch,
and environmental relationships. Emphasis should be given to species such as Spanish sardine that are important
as prey to gamefish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Description and quantification of predator-prey relationships between coastal herring species and carnivores
such as mackerels, tunas, swordfish, billfish, sharks, bluefish, and others in high demand by commercial and recreational
fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Design of innovative economic and social management approaches for the purse seine menhaden fishery, including,
but not limited to, limited entry.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Fisheries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commercial and recreational demand for migratory coastal pelagics has led to overfishing for certain species,
including king and Spanish mackerel. Additionally, some are transboundary with Mexico and other countries and ultimately
will demand international management attention. Current high priorities include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Recruitment indices for king and Spanish mackerel, cobia, dolphin, and bluefish, primarily from fishery-independent
data sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessment and management models for coastal pelagic resources that are dominated by single year classes, such
as Spanish mackerel, dolphin, and bluefish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Fishery-independent methods of assessing stock abundance of king and Spanish mackerel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Improved catch statistics for all species in Mexican waters, with special emphasis on king mackerel; needed especially
is length-frequency, life history and genetic information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Information on populations of coastal pelagics overwintering off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,
especially population size, age and movement patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Basic biostatistical information on cobia and dolphin to develop age-length keys and maturation schedules for
stock assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Impact of bag limits on total catch and landings of king and Spanish mackerel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Demand and supply functions for recreational and commercial fisheries for king mackerel in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis should be on changes in marginal values of producer and consumer surpluses, since the
studies would be used in allocation frameworks where total values are not necessarily required.

Groundfish and Estuarine Fishes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantial stocks of groundfish and estuarine species occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the database
for assessments comes from studies conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the historic
and current size of these fish stocks, their importance as predator and prey species, and their current or potential
use as commercial and recreational fisheries, more information on their biology and conservation is needed. General
research needs are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Red drum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Effects of sportfishing on red drum populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. A specific need in the
South Atlantic is increased sampling of nighttime fishing for red drum on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Size and age-structure of the offshore adult red drum stock in the Gulf of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Immigration and escapement of red drum from state waters into the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico
and the South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Life history parameters and stock structure for the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include
migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore
and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries. Specific research needs for Atlantic red
drum are fecundity estimates, as a function of length and weight, and improved coastwide coverage for age-length
keys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Catch-and-release mortality rates from inshore and nearshore waters, and fishing mortality rates in state territorial
waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Life history and stock structure for weakfish, menhaden, spot and croaker in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.
Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and
comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Improved catch and effort statistics from recreational and commercial fisheries, including size and age structure
of the catch, to develop production models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many areas of research that need to be addressed for improved understanding and management of fishery resources.
These include methods for data collection, management, analysis, and for better conservation. Examples of high
priority research needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Design and critical analysis of a data collection system that may involve permits, logbooks, trip interviews,
dealer reporting or other innovative methods. The system design should be applicable across the entire range of species
that may be pursued throughout the Gulf and South Atlantic, and should address economic, biological and social data
needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessment of the changes in recreational and commercial values that have resulted from past management practices
for red drum, shrimp, mackerels and reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Development of improved methods and procedures for technology transfer, and education of constituency groups
on fishery management and conservation programs. Of special importance are programs concerned with controlled
access and introduction of conservation gear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Compilation of baseline socio-demographic data for describing the social and cultural framework of managed fisheries.
B. Priority in program emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering,
maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment
success; and generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated
as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through short- and long-term research efforts, with consideration
given to the magnitude of the eventual economic benefits that may be realized.

XIV. Selection Procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be ranked by a NMFS scientific panel into two groups: (a) Recommended, and (b) Not Recommended.
Proposals ranked as Not Recommended will not be given further consideration for selection and funding. All rankings
will be presented to a panel of non-NOAA fishery experts, who will individually consider the significance of the problem
addressed in each project proposal, the technical evaluation, and need for funding. These panel members will provide
individual recommendations to NMFS on each proposal classified as Recommended or Not Recommended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-NOAA panel members' individual comments, recommendations and evaluations, and recommendations of the
NMFS scientific panel and NMFS Southeast Program Officer will be considered by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS
(Regional Director). The Regional Director, in consultation with the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
will: (a) Determine which projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA
or are approved for funding by other Federal offices, and recommend the projects to be funded. The exact amount of funds
awarded, the final scope of activities, the project duration, and specific NMFS cooperative involvement with the
activities of each project will be determined in pre-award negotiations between the applicant, the NOAA Grants Office,
and the NMFS Program Staff. Projects must not be initiated by recipients until a signed award is received from the NOAA
Grants Office. For project periods of more than 1 year, funds for subsequent budget periods may be provided if initial
project tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has received MARFIN funds for subsequent periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal
agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public
safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation
will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity
for those who make a substantial commitment to service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs
operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program.
The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions
of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteers programs previously supported
by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this summer, and most of the others will be operational
by this fall.

Purusant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept,
hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money,
or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.''
42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use
of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction
under the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 170. The Corporation may also ``solicit and accept the voluntary services
of individuals'' to assist the Corporation in carrying out the national service program. 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chief Executive Officer (the CEO) of the Corporation, or his or her designee, has the authority to solicit donations

and distribution. The CEO will only solicit or accept, donations if the solicitation or acceptance ``will not reflect
unfavorably upon the ability of the Corporation, or of any officer or employee of the Corporation, to carry out the
responsibilities or official duties of the Corporation in a fair and objective manner; and *&blank;*&blank;* will
not compromise the integrity of the programs of the Corporation or any official or employee of the Corporation involved
in such programs.'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(C). In addition, the CEO will not solicit or accept, products or services
from the manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of alcohol, tobacco, or firearms products.

DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR 600.14, the unsolicited proposal
entitled ``Sustained Utility Implementation of Photovoltaics'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal
be accepted for support without further competition in accordance with &sect;600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.

This award involves cost sharing on the hardware, installation and evaluation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic
systems for residential, commercial/utility sized (substation), and building-integrated applications. Sacramento
Municipal Utility Districts' (SMUD) ``sustained orderly development'' effort to advance the commercialization
of grid-connected photovoltaics plans to install about 900 kW of grid-connected PV systems. This will include about
100 residential ``PV Pioneer'' systems, several systems of the commercial/utility size, and building-integrated
applications such as PV integrated as architectural building components and demand-side management applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The phase I activities include procurement activities, including issuance of the RFP, bids, proposal evaluations,
negotiations and SMUD board approval. Phase II activities include the installation, monitoring and evaluation
of PV systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project represents a unique opportunity to evaluate large-scale, distributed, utility grid-connected PV
applications; implement a substantial hardware procurement; and support the commercialization of grid-connected
photovoltaics. SMUD has a high probability of achieving the project objectives based on past projects, a ``large''
service area for the implementation of grid-connected applications and community commitment to the adoption of
PV technology. SMUD's resources and commitment to extending the utility PV collaborative process and promoting
cooperative ventures to accelerate the commercialization of utility PV applications should provide a basis for
the successful implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program cost is estimated to be $10,800,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,600,000 or 14.8%. The proposed DOE
funding for FY 94 is $500,000 and for FY 95 is $1,100,000.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Murphy is a petroleum refiner and a producer subject to the audit jurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with
the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During the period covered by the proposed Consent Order,
January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, Murphy engaged in, among other things, the production, sale and refining
of crude oil. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and DOE entered into a Consent Order (hereinafter the 1987 Consent Order)
that settled, with certain specific exceptions, all claims and disputes against Murphy by DOE for the period January
1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. The 1987 Consent Order specifically excepted, among other things, issues or claims
then pending or arising out of first sales of crude oil produced and sold from properties operated by Murphy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of DOE's investigation of Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations
during the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December
15, 1986. On June 17, 1992, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) modified the PRO and issued it as a Remedial Order
(RO) to Murphy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 22 DOE &para; 83,005 (1992). The RO finds Murphy liable to make restitution of $13,366,664.60, plus interest to
the date of restitution, for violations of the regulations applicable to first sales of domestic crude oil (10 CFR
&sect;&sect;212.72&hyph;212.74), the regulations exempting from the price rules the sale of crude oil produced
from ``stripper well'' properties (10 CFR &sect;&sect;210.32 and 212.54), and the normal business practices rule
(10 CFR &sect;210.62(c)) in connection with Murphy's first sales of crude oil during the period September 1973 through
December 1979. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the RO would total $67.6 million through June 1994.
Murphy appealed that RO to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RO also remands for further proceedings claims against Murphy pertaining to Murphy's operation of properties
for which the PRO found violations during the year 1979, as well as certain crude oil properties not included within
ERA's investigation of Murphy or within the PRO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1994, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision and proposed order (D&amp;PO) that modified
the RO and directed recalculation of the amount of restitution.

, 66 FERC &para;63,002 (1994). The D&amp;PO is now pending before the Commission in Docket No. RO92&hyph;5&hyph;000.
With interest, Murphy's current liability under the D&amp;PO (including ERA's estimate of Murphy's liability for
previously unaudited properties and unaudited time periods (yet to be adjudicated by OHA or FERC)) totals approximately
$5.2 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ERA has preliminarily agreed to the proposed $10,700,000 settlement as resolution of Murphy's liability for DOE
regulatory violations for the period covered by the proposed Consent Order. ERA has made this tentative determination
after an assessment of the risks of the current matters in litigation. Among other things, ERA has considered the risk
pertaining to the following issues that Murphy has raised in its defense: whether Murphy properly applied the definition
of ``property'' to certain of its offshore and onshore producing premises in the period September 1973 through August
1976; whether the largest of Murphy's offshore producing premises qualified as multiple DOE ``properties'' under
DOE Rulings 1977&hyph;1 and 1977&hyph;2; whether Murphy charged prices in excess of the appropriate ceiling prices
for crude oil produced from offshore and onshore properties that it operated; whether Murphy should be liable for
100% of the overcharges associated with sales of crude oil that had been taken ``in kind'' from Murphy-operated properties
and sold by working interest owners; and whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with
certain sales of crude oil from Murphy-operated properties as to which the federal government received a royalty
interest. ERA has also considered the time and expense that would be required for the government to litigate every
issue fully. Based on these factors, ERA has tentatively concluded that the resolution of its claims against Murphy
for $10,700,000 is an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. Except as specifically excluded, all pending
and potential civil and administrative disputes, claims and causes of action, whether or not heretofore asserted,
between the DOE and Murphy relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations
are resolved and extinguished by this Consent Order. Murphy and DOE mutually release each other from the claims arising
under the subject matter covered by the proposed Consent Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the proposed Consent Order, Murphy is required to pay the sum of $10,700,000 within thirty (30) days
of the effective date of the Consent Order and shall maintain records as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with
the terms of this Consent Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the settlement is not made final by the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day following execution, Murphy may withdraw
from the proposed agreement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Arizona Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to
as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to treat up to 55,000 acres
of head and leaf lettuce, 8,500 acres of broccoli, 6,100 acres of cauliflower, and 3,500 acres of cabbage to control
the sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (

). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA
is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on head and leaf lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower to control the
sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of
this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant states that a new strain, or possibly a new species, of whitefly, often referred to as the strain B of sweet
potato whitefly, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW), was initially found in Arizona in 1988. Since that time, it has steadily
spread to new host plants and grown in population size each summer and fall. The SLW causes damage by feeding, and also
through the production of honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. When SLWs become numerous
as they did in many areas of the state in the past several years, their direct feeding lowers the yield. The SLW has also
been implicated as a vector of virus. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SLW is not being achieved with
currently registered products and alternative cultural practices. Along with this request, the Applicant has also
requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical, bifenthrin, on the named crops, for control of the
same pest. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid would be applied
once at planting, as a soil treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic, it would be taken up by the seedling as it germinates,
and protect the emerging seedling. The Applicant states that bifenthrin can only be applied as a foliar spray, which
is of little value during the early establishment phase of seedling development, as there is limited leaf area at that
time. Thus the Applicant proposed that use of bifenthrin be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment.
The Applicant indicates that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its
mode of action is such that resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the
use of this chemical further into the growing season for this reason. The Applicant indicates that without adequate
control of the SLW in the named crops, significant economic losses will be suffered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 5 oz. (dry) active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product)
per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 73,100 acres of the above-listed crops. For each
of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage
could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant proposes
to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per acre. Therefore,
use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 36,550 lbs. of active ingredient, or 18,275
gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named crops.
The Applicant received specific exemptions last year (1993) for imidacloprid on broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage,
and head and leaf lettuce, and for bifenthrin on broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce. In 1992, the Applicant was
granted specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SLW control in broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because of the highly specialized nature of termiticides, a number of issues evolved over the years with regard to
products' labeling: (1) limitations on distribution, sale, or use; (2) precautionary statements; (3) environmental
hazards statements; (4) storage and disposal statements; (5) use directions; (6) the longevity of termiticide treatments;
and (7) application at less-than-labeled rates. In 1988, representatives from the termiticide manufacturing and
user industry, State pesticide regulatory officials, and EPA representatives met voluntarily under the auspices
of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation
Group (SFIREG) to identify specific issues to be addressed. The identified issues were set forth in AAPCO/SFIREG's
1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and were endorsed by the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials
(ASPCRO).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 American Cyanamid Co., Agricultural Research Division, P.O. Box 400, Princeton, NJ 08543&hyph;0400, has requested
in pesticide petition (PP) 3G4203 the establishment of a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre
Ammonium salt of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-imidazol-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid in or on the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat
at 0.1 part per million (ppm). This temporary tolerance will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodity
when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit 241-EUP-125, which is being issued
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat.
819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment
of the temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been established
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. American Cyanamid Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tolerance expires May 31, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity
after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may
be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide
indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.

Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission
and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans.
Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Tennessee-based
corporation that provides acute care hospital services to divest Holy Cross Hospital of Salt Lake City to a Commission
approved acquirer; to complete the divestiture within six months of the date of the order; and to consent to the appointment
of a trustee, if the divestiture is not completed within six months. In addition, the proposed consent agreement would
require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years, before purchasing any acute care hospital
or any hospital, medical or surgical diagnostic or treatment service or facility in the Utah counties of Weber, Davis,
and Salt Lake.

Appendix I

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agreement to Hold Separate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Agreement to Hold Separate (``Agreement'') is by and between Healthtrust, Inc._The Hospital Company (``respondent''
or ``Healthtrust''), a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the
State of Delaware, with its principal place of business at 4525 Harding Road, Nashville, Tennessee 37205; and the
Federal Trade Commission (``Commission''), an independent agency of the United States Government, established
under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, 15 U.S.C. 41, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, on or about December 3, 1993, respondent entered into an agreement with Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy
Cross''), an Indiana corporation, whereby respondent will acquire from Holy Cross certain Holy Cross assets in Utah
(hereinafter the ``Acquisition''); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine if it would violate any of the statutes enforced
by the Commission; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, if the Commission accepts the attached Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), which would require
the divestiture of certain assets listed in Schedule A of the Consent Order (``Schedule A Assets''), including Holy
Cross Hospital (``HCH'') in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Commission must place the Consent Order on the public record
for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules' and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo ante
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the Schedule A Assets during the period prior to the final acceptance and issuance of the Consent Order by the Commission
(after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of
the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the Commission's
ability to require the divestiture of the Schedule A Assets as described in Paragraph II of the Consent Order and the
Commission's right to have HCH continue as a viable independent acute care hospital; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the purpose of this Agreement and the Consent Order is to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) preserve HCH as a viable independent acute care hospital pending its divestiture, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, respondent's entering into this Agreement shall in no way be construed as an admission by respondent that the Acquisition
is illegal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, respondent understands that no act or transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed immune or exempt
from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything contained in this
Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Now, therefore,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the parties agree, upon understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the Acquisition will be
challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, unless the Commission determines to reject
the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from respondent with respect to the Acquisition, except that the
Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Agreement and the Consent Order to which it is annexed and
made a part thereof, and in the event the required divestiture is not accomplished, to appoint a trustee to seek divestiture
of the Schedule A Assets pursuant to the Consent Order, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Respondent agrees to execute the Agreement Containing Consent Order and be bound by the attached Consent Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Respondent agrees that from the date this Agreement is accepted until the earliest of the dates listed in subparagraphs
2.a-2.b, it will comply with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Agreement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. three (3) business days after the Commission withdraws its acceptance of the Consent Order pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the day after the divestiture required by the Consent Order has been completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Respondent will hold the Schedule A Assets as they are presently constituted separate and apart on the following
terms and conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The Schedule A Assets, as they are presently constituted, shall be held separate and apart and shall be operated
independently of respondent (meaning here and hereinafter, Healthtrust excluding the Schedule A Assets) except
to the extent that respondent must exercise direction and control over the Schedule A Assets to assure compliance
with this Agreement or the Consent Order, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Prior to, or simultaneously with its acquisition of the Holy Cross assets in Utah, respondent shall organize a distinct
and separate legal entity, either a corporation, limited liability company, general or limited partnership (``New
Company'') and adopt constituent documents for the New Company that are not inconsistent with other provisions of
this Agreement or the Consent Order. Respondent shall transfer all ownership and control of all Schedule A Assets
to the New Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The board of directors of the New Company, or, in the event respondent organizes an entity other than a corporation,
the governing body of the entity (``New Company Board'') shall have five members. Respondent may elect the members
of the New Company Board; provided, however, that the New Company Board shall include no more than two members who are
a director, officer, employee, or agent of respondent (``the respondent's New Company Board member(s)''). The New
Company Board shall include a chairman who is independent of respondent and is competent to assure the continued viability
and competitiveness of the Schedule A Assets. Meetings of the New Company Board during the term of this Agreement shall
be stenographically transcribed and the transcripts retained for two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Respondent shall not exercise direction or control over, or influence directly or indirectly, the Schedule A Assets,
the independent Chairman of the Board of the New Company, the New Board, or the New Company or any of its operations or
businesses; provided, however, that respondent may exercise only such direction and control over the New Company
as is necessary to assure compliance with this Agreement or the Consent Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Respondent shall maintain the viability and competitiveness and the marketability of the Schedule A Assets and
shall not sell, transfer, encumber (other than in the normal course of business), or otherwise impair their viability
and competitiveness or their marketability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Except for the respondent's New Company Board members, respondent shall not permit any director, officer, employee,
or agent of respondent to also be a director, officer, or employee of the New Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The New Company shall be staffed with sufficient employees to maintain the viability and competitiveness of the
Schedule A Assets, which employees shall be selected from Holy Cross's existing employee base and may also be hired
from sources other than Holy Cross.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. With the exception of the respondent's New Company Board Members, respondent shall not change the composition
of the New Company Board unless the independent chairman consents. The independent chairman shall have power to remove
members of the New Company Board for cause. Respondent shall not change the composition of the management of the New
Company except that the New Company Board shall have the power to remove management employees for cause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
i. If the independent chairman ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute chairman shall be appointed in
the same manner as provided in Paragraph 3.c. of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Except as required by law, and except to the extent that necessary information is exchanged in the course of evaluating
the Acquisition, defending investigations or defending or prosecuting litigation, or negotiating agreements
to divest assets, or complying with this Agreement or the Consent Order, respondent shall not receive or have access
to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about the New Company
or the activities of the New Company Board. Nor shall the New Company or the New Company Board receive or have access
to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about respondent and
relating to respondent's acute care hospitals in Utah. Respondent may receive on a regular basis aggregate financial
information relating to the New Company necessary and essential to allow respondent to prepare United States consolidated
financial reports, tax returns and personnel reports. Any such information that is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph
shall be used only for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. (``Material confidential information,'' as used
herein, means competitively sensitive or proprietary information not independently known to respondent from sources
other than the New Company, and includes but is not limited to customer lists, price lists, marketing methods, patents,
technologies, processes, or other trade secrets.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not in their capacity as
New Company Board members, receive material confidential information and shall not disclose any such information
received under this Agreement to respondent or use it to obtain any advantage for respondent. The respondent's New
Company Board members shall enter a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential
information. The respondent's New Company Board members shall participate in matters that come before the New Company
Board only for the limited purposes of considering a capital investment or other transaction exceeding $250,000,
approving any proposed budget and operating plans, and carrying out respondent's responsibilities under this Agreement
and the Consent Order. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not
participate in any matter, or attempt to influence the votes of the other members of the New Company Board with respect
to matters, that would involve a conflict of interest if respondent and the New Company were separate and independent
entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. If necessary to assure compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Consent Agreement, or the Consent Order,
respondent may, but is not required to, assign an individual to the New Company for the purpose of overseeing such compliance
(``on-site person''). The on-site person shall have access to all officers and employees of the New Company and such
records of the New Company as he deems necessary and reasonable to assure compliance. Such individual shall enter
into a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. Any material transaction of the New Company that is out of the ordinary course of business must be approved by a majority
vote of the New Company Board; provided that the New Company shall engage in no transaction, material or otherwise,
that is precluded by this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n. All earnings and profits of the New Company shall be retained separately in the New Company. If necessary, respondent
shall provide the New Company with sufficient working capital to operate at its current rate of operation, and to carry
out any capital improvement plans for the New Company which have already been approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o. During the period commencing on the date this Agreement is effective and terminating on the earlier of (i) six months
after the date the Consent Order becomes final, or (ii) the date contemplated by subparagraph 2.a (the ``Initial Divestiture
Period''), respondent shall make available for use by the New Company funds sufficient to perform all necessary routine
maintenance to, and replacements of, the Schedule A Assets (``normal repair and replacement''). After termination
of the Initial Divestiture Period and until the earlier of the date contemplated by either subparagraph 2.a or 2.b,
respondent shall make available for use by the New Company each year an amount not less than that required for normal
repair and replacement, plus $1,000,000 for capital improvements to the Schedule A Assets, unless a smaller amount
is requested or required by the New Company, in its sole discretion, for capital expenditures. Provided, however,
that in any event, respondent shall provide the New Company with such funds as are necessary to maintain the viability
and competitiveness and marketability of the Schedule A Assets.

4. Should the Federal Trade Commission seek in any proceeding to compel respondent to divest any of the Schedule A Assets,
as provided in the Consent Order, or to seek any other injunctive or equitable relief for any failure to comply with
the Consent Order or this Agreement, or in any way relating to the Acquisition, as defined in the draft complaint, respondent
shall not raise any objection based upon the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act waiting period or the fact that the Commission has permitted the Acquisition. Respondent also waives all rights
to contest the validity of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. To the extent that this Agreement requires respondent to take, or prohibits respondent from taking, certain actions
that otherwise may be required or prohibited by contract, respondent shall abide by the terms of this Agreement or
the Consent Order and shall not assert as a defense such contract requirements in a civil penalty action brought by
the Commission to enforce the terms of this Agreement or Consent Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Agreement, subject to any legally recognized privilege,
and upon written request with reasonable notice to respondent made to its principal office, respondent shall permit
any duly authorized representative or representatives of the Commission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Access during the office hours of respondent and in the presence of counsel to inspect and copy all books, ledgers,
accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of respondent
relating to compliance with this Agreement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Upon five (5) days' notice to respondent, and without restraint or interference from respondent, to interview
officers or employees of respondent, who may have counsel present, regarding any such matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, a proposed consent order from Healthtrust
Inc._The Hospital Company (``Healthtrust''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission
that Healthtrust's proposed acquisition of three hospitals from Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross'')
would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, if it had been carried
out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Healthtrust and Holy Cross own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute care hospitals
in the Salt Lake City area, encompassing Salt Lake County and southern Davis County; and the Salt Lake City_Ogden Metropolitan
Statistical Area, an area encompassing three contiguous counties in northern Utah: Weber County, Davis County,
and Salt Lake County (``Three-County Area''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the
proposed acquisition's impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in the Salt Lake City area and the
Three-County Area. According to the complaint, Healthtrust owns and operates Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful (in
southern Davis County) and Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City (in Salt Lake County). Holy Cross owns and operates
St. Benedict's Hospital in Ogden (in Weber County), and two acute care hospitals in Salt Lake County, Holy Cross Hospital
in Salt Lake City, and Holy-Cross-Jordan Valley Hospital in West Jordan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consent order, if finally accepted by the Commission, would settle charges that the acquisition may substantially
lessen competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. The complaint alleges that Healthtrust and
Holy Cross are competitors in those markets. The hospital markets in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area,
according to the complaint, were already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The
complaint alleges that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects
in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.

The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture by Healthtrust of the Holy Cross
Hospital and related assets, including interests in five clinics, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The purpose of the divestiture
is to ensure the continuation of Holy Cross Hospital as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Healthtrust,
and to remedy the lessening of competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets resulting
from the acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires Healthtrust to obtain the approval of the Commission for the divestiture of Holy Cross
Hospital. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture must be completed within six months of the date the
order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the six-month period, Healthtrust would
consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have twelve additional months to effect the divestiture. The hold
separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires Healthtrust, until the completion of the divestiture
or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets and businesses of Holy Cross Hospital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement
by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of
the Commission, Holy Cross Hospital to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any other acute care
hospital in the Three-County Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order would prohibit Healthtrust from acquiring any acute care hospital in the Three-County Area without the
prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit Healthtrust from transferring, without prior
Commission approval, any acute care hospital it operates in the Three-County Area to another person operating (or
in the process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission
authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of Healthtrust with those
of any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area, unless Healthtrust convinced the Commission that a particular
transaction would not endanger competition in the Salt Lake City area or the Three-County Area. The provisions would
not apply to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions
would expire ten years after the order becomes final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ten years, the order would prohibit Healthtrust from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital
in the Three-County Area to another party without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee
to be bound by the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in
its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation
of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Healthtrust that its proposed
acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

I voted against acceptance of the proposed consent agreement in this matter, as well as against a previous motion to
seek a preliminary injunction to enjoin HealthTrust from acquiring three Holy Cross hospitals in the Salt Lake City,
Utah, area. The three hospitals to be acquired were: Jordan Valley, a 50-bed hospital located in the Salt Lake City
metropolitan area; St. Benedict's, a 239-bed tertiary level hospital
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 located approximately 34 miles north of Salt Lake City in Ogden; and a 200-bed tertiary facility located in downtown
Salt Lake City. In analyzing the original proposed transaction, I concluded that the merger of these two hospital
systems would generate significant net efficiencies that would outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects
of the merger in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area and throughout the Wasatch Front. Specifically, the Holy Cross
hospitals offered HealthTrust the opportunity to expand its geographic coverage by including hospitals located
throughout the Wasatch Front, and broaden the services it provided by including a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary
care facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Medical services are generally divided into primary, secondary, tertiary and now quaternary levels. Primary services
are provided by generalists, including family practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians, and internists.
Secondary services are provided by specialists, such as cardiologists, oncologists, and orthopedic specialists.
Tertiary services are those provided by sub-specialists, such as invasive cardiology or neurosurgery. Quaternary
level services are those offered by only a few highly specialized facilities, like high level burn units or organ transplants.
The demarcation between the various levels of service is not precise, but these levels are all included as part of the
``acute care inpatient hospital services'' market alleged in the complaint here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed consent allows HealthTrust to acquire two of the Holy Cross hospitals, Jordan Valley and St. Benedict's,
while requiring divestiture of the downtown Holy Cross hospital. Allowing HealthTrust to acquire the two Holy Cross
hospitals will give HealthTrust better geographic coverage across the Wasatch Front. However, requiring the divestiture
of the downtown Holy Cross facility means that the newly formed hospital network will not include a tertiary care facility
in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was argued in this case (as it has been argued in several recent hospital mergers) that the merging hospital systems
can achieve network and operational efficiencies through acquisition that are not possible through alternative
arrangements such as contracting or joint venturing. Parties have sought to show that contracting and joint venturing
is inefficient as an alternative to outright merger, among other reasons, because of the need to deter ``gaming''
on patient referrals as each hospital attempts to shift costly patients to other hospitals. This argument seems plausible
in this industry because of contracting problems involved in establishing ``capitation'' regimes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this particular case, it was argued that purchasing a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary care facility was essential
to achieve network efficiencies and that contracting or joint venturing was an inferior alternative. I find this
argument persuasive.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, because I believe that the bulk of the network and operational efficiencies that are possible from this
merger will be lost if the downtown facility is divested, and because I believe that the potential anticompetitive
effects that may have resulted from allowing HealthTrust to acquire the downtown facility are outweighed by those
efficiencies, I have dissented from the issuance of this consent.

The relative effectiveness of different organizational forms such as mergers, joint ventures or contracting relationships
deserves further study in light of the current restructuring of the health care industry. While I agree that network
efficiency claims may be more credible if they are endorsed by health plans (see Remarks of Mary Lou Steptoe before
the Practicing Law Institute, June 17&hyph;20, 1994) we are often presented with situations of ``dueling'' affidavits,
in which case other evidence must be present to support such claims.

consumers should not expect to experience similar results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents L&amp;S Research
Corporation and Scott Chinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's complaint charges that the respondents deceptively advertised Cybergenics Total Body Building
System and Cybergenics for Hard Gainers, two body building products. According to the complaint, the respondents'
advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that either or both body building products:
(1) cause users to lose more body fat and gain more muscle than non-users; (2) cause users to lose body fat and gain muscle
more rapidly than non-users; (3) cause users to gain more muscle than users of other body building products; (4) have
been demonstrated by scientific research to cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (5) work for all people;
and (6) are new and unique.

The Commission's complaint also charges that the respondents deceptively advertised there weight loss products,
Cybergenics CyberTrim, Cybergenics Mega-Fat Burner, and Cybergenics QuickTrim. According to the complaint, the
respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that one or more of the wright loss
products: (1) cause users to lose body fat and weight more rapidly than non-users; (2) cause users to lose weight and
lose or burn more body fat than non-users; (3) cause users to lose more body fat and weight than users of all other weight
loss products; (4) cause users to lose weight more rapidly than the users of all other weight loss products; (5) are
superior to other appetite suppressants; (6) suppress hunger and the biochemical message stimulated by the catabolism
of fat; (7) cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (8) contain an ingredient, chromium picolinate, that has
been clinically proven to reduce fat and lower cholesterol; (9) are new and unique; (10) cause users to maintain weight
loss longer than non-users; (11) cause maturing women to lose more weight than non-users of the product; (12) are easy
to use; and (13) have been demonstrated by scientific evidence to cause users to lose more fat and weight, and to gain
more muscle, than non-users.

Use of Testimonials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's complaint also charges that statements and depictions, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures,
in the respondents' advertisements for their body building and weight loss products, represent that the testimonials
from consumers who use the advertised product reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public
who use the products. According to the complaint, the respondents did not have a reasonable basis for this representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the complaint alleges that the use of a picture of a man in an advertisement for Cybergenics Total Body
Building System ``before'' and ``after'' he used the product for six months is false and misleading. The man pictured
in the advertisement, according to the complaint, was a champion body builder prior to the time when the ``before''
picture was taken and, therefore, is not typical of users of the product, and his results as shown in the ``after'' picture
are not typical of the experience of ordinary members of the public who use the product.

Proposed Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part I of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of either of the body building products
named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) causes users to achieve greater or more rapid loss of fat or gain of muscle than non-users of the product; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) works for all users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of any of the three weight loss
products named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) causes users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) causes maturing women to lose more weight than non-users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III prohibits respondents from representing that scientific evidence establishes that the product component
of any of the body building and weight loss products named in the complaint causes users to lose more fat or weight, or
gains more muscle, than non-users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part IV requires the respondents to cease from making a number of representations about any product or program unless
they have substantiation consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence. The claims that are prohibited
unless substantiated are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) that any product or program causes or assists users to lose fat or weight or to maintain weight loss, or suppresses
hunger or appetite;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) that any product or program causes or assists in muscle gain or development;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) that any product or program works for all users;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) that chromium picolinate in any product or used in conjunction with any program builds muscle, reduces fat, or
lowers cholesterol; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) that any product or program intended for body building, weight loss, or fat loss is more effective than other products
or programs intended for similar purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part V of the proposed order requires respondents to have substantiation, which when appropriate must consist of
competent and reliable scientific evidence, for believing that endorsements, including ``before'' and ``after''
pictures, represent the typical or ordinary experience of users of any product or program. However, the respondents
may use any endorsement if they disclose clearly and prominently in close proximity to the endorsement what the generally
expected performance would be in the depicted circumstances, or that consumers should not expect to achieve results
similar to those of the endorser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part VI prohibits the respondents from misrepresenting that any product or program is new or unique, or that any product
or program intended for weight loss is easy to use if achieving the advertised results requires a special diet or exercise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part VII requires the respondents to cease misrepresenting the contents, validity, or results of any study in connection
with the marketing or any product or program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part VIII requires the respondents to pay $1,450,000 to the United States Treasury and provides that none of this amount
is deemed to be a fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining provisions are standard record keeping and reporting provisions designed to ensure that the respondents
remain in compliance with the other provisions of the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has strong evidence supporting the central allegations in this complaint, and I have voted to accept
the consent agreement for public comment. In my view, however, the complaint should not allege that the maintenance
claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim were false. I am inclined to believe
that the claims are false but I would prefer to have some corroborating evidence of falsity before finding reason to
believe that Section 5 of the FTC Act has been violated. Because the available information shows only that there is
no evidence that these claims are true, it seems to me more appropriate to allege that they are unsubstantiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the QuickTrim weight loss allegations seem inconsistent in light of the evidence. The complaint alleges
that the weight loss claim for maturing women users of QuickTrim is false but alleges that the same claim for all users
of QuickTrim is unsubstantiated. Yet we have no evidence indicating that the weight loss claims are any more likely
to be false for maturing women than for users generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I therefore do not support the complaint to the extent that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing
women weight loss claim for QuickTrim are alleged to be false, not unsubstantiated.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Ohio-based
drugstore chain to divest, within one year of the order, to a Commission approved acquirer, all assets related to the
retail sale of prescription drugs in either the respondent's store or in the acquired Hook-SupeRx (HSI) retail store
in each of three geographic areas, and to complete the divestiture within one year. If not complete in that period of
time, the order would require the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In addition,
the proposed consent agreement would require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') having initiated an investigation of the proposed acquisition of
all of the voting stock of Hook SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI''), by Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco''), and it is now appearing that
Revco, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``Proposed Respondent,'' is willing to enter into an agreement containing
an order (``Agreement'') to divest certain assets, and to cease and desist from making certain acquisitions, and
providing for certain other relief:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby agreed by and between Proposed Respondent, by its duty authorized officers and attorneys, and counsel
for the Commission that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed Respondent Revco is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by the virtue of the
laws of the State of Delaware with its office and principal place of business located at 1925 Enterprise Parkway, Twinsburg,
Ohio 44087. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proposed Respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Proposed Respondent waives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. any further procedural steps;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This Agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this Agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the Proposed
Respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This Agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Proposed Respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This Agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission
may, without further notice to the Proposed Respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to divest and to cease and
desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the
Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the
same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States
Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to Proposed Respondent's address as
stated in this Agreement shall constitute service. Proposed Respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner
of services. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation,
or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed Respondent has read the proposed Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed Respondent understands
that once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the Order. Proposed Respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Respondent shall divest, absolutely and in good faith, within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes
final, the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Respondent shall divest the Assets To Be Divested only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval
of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture
of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continued use of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies
engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy the lessening
of competition resulting from the acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Pending divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain

(6) months of such repossession. If Respondent has not redivested such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II
of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession, the provisions of Paragraph III shall apply to these assets.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If Respondent has not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Assets
To Be Divested within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, the Commission may appoint a trustee
to divest the Assets To Be Divested. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to
&sect;5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission,
Respondent shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a
decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from
seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to &sect;5(l)
of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent
to comply with this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondent shall
consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondent
has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten
(10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondent
shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Respondent shall execute a trust agreement that, subject
to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the
trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III.B.3 to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that
divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or
in the case of a court-appointed trustee by the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the
Assets To Be Divested, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondent shall
develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee.
Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any
delays in divestiture caused by Respondent shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount
equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission subject to Respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no
minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph II
of this Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquirer, and if the Commission determines to approve more
than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest to the acquirer or acquirers selected by Respondent from among those
approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondent, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's
duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses
incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account
of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondent
and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part
on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, and Respondent shall either
defend against such claims or pay the trustee's expenses, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any such claim, whether or not resulting in any liability,
except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross
negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III.A. of this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request
of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
required by this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The trustee shall report in writing to Respondent and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish divestiture.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco'') under which Revco would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic locations
where it faces limited competition. Revco operates the Revco chain of drug stores.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1994 Revco and Hook-SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI'') executed an Agreement and Plan or Merger providing for the
acquisition by Revco of all of the voting securities of HSI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition,
if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect;18, and Section
5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect;45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in
the following towns: Covington, Virginia; Marion, Virginia; and Radford, Virginia (hereinafter ``relevant geographic
area''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors
in the relevant geographic areas where Revco and HSI are direct competitors and where they face limited competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Revco shall divest all assets
related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Revco or HSI retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The
divestiture of the Revco or HSI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer
or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of
the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business
in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited
to: owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously
employed by Revco or HSI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Revco has not divested the Revco
or HSI pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that Revco shall consent
to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Revco is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance
with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and
every sixty (60) days thereafter until Revco has completely divested its interest in assets related to the retail
sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Revco, for a period
of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in
the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business
of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Revco will be required to
provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Revco
to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) day prior to any change in the structure of Revco resulting in the emergence
of a successor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

I. Executive Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985, Congress mandated that unitary chemical warfare agents be destroyed in such a manner as to provide maximum
protection for the environment, the public, and personnel involved in destroying the agents. The National Center
for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was delegated review and oversight
responsibility for any Department of the Army (DA) plans to dispose of or transport chemical weapons (Public Law 91&hyph;121
and 91&hyph;441, Armed Forces Appropriation Authorization of 1970 and 1971).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its ongoing efforts to improve medical preparedness within the medical sector of civilian communities
surrounding chemical agent depots, CDC has developed the following medical preparedness and response guidelines.
These guidelines represent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
minimum standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of medical preparedness for civilian communities that might be exposed to chemical warfare agents during the incineration
or storage process. These guidelines were developed in cooperation with a panel of recognized experts in the fields
of emergency medicine, disaster preparedness, nursing, chemical warfare preparedness, and the prehospital emergency
medical system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985, Congress mandated that unitary chemical warfare agents be destroyed in such a manner as to provide maximum
protection for the environment, the public, and the personnel involved in destroying the agents. This mandate was
further defined in the Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization Act of 1986, Public Law 99&hyph;145. Consistent
with its desire to promote the most environmentally safe method of destroying chemical agents, the National Research
Council determined that incineration is the best method for disposing of the weapons(1). In 1988, The Authorization
Act was amended to permit DA to set up a prototype incineration facility on Johnston Island in the Pacific in order to
verify the safety of such an operation. To date, more than 700,000 pounds of chemical agent have been safely incinerated
there.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCEH, CDC, was delegated the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing any DA plans to dispose of or transport chemical
weapons (Public Law 91&hyph;121 and 91&hyph;441, Armed Forces Appropriation Authorization of 1970 and 1971). In
addition, an interagency agreement between CDC and DA requires CDC to provide technical assistance to the DA in protecting
the public health in nearby communities during the destruction of unitary chemical agents and weapon systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, large quantities of chemical warfare agents are stored in eight facilities in the continental United
States. These chemical stockpiles consist primarily of nerve agents, mustard agents, or a combination of both. In
Tooele, Utah, construction of the chemical agent incinerator is now complete, and destruction of the weapons and
chemicals in this depot is scheduled to begin in Spring of 1995. To improve the ability of local health care personnel
to handle emergencies related to a chemical agent release, CDC has presented medical preparedness courses to civilian
medical personnel on sites adjacent to the eight chemical weapons depots on 13 occasions. Emergency physicians,
nurses, internists, surgeons, hospital administrators, and prehospital emergency medical responders have attended
these courses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its ongoing efforts to improve medical readiness in civilian communities surrounding chemical agent depots,
CDC developed medical preparedness and response guidelines. These guidelines represent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
minimum standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for medical preparedness in civilian communities that might be inadvertently exposed to chemical warfare agents
during the incineration or storage process. These guidelines were developed in cooperation with a working group
of recognized experts in the fields of emergency medicine, disaster preparedness, nursing, chemical stockpile
emergency preparedness, and prehospital emergency medical systems. These guidelines do not supersede current
medical and public health practices and requirements (e.g., precautions for handling bodily fluids).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following recommendations for civilian community response to the release of a chemical agent are divided into
prehospital and hospital. The recommendations are designed to ensure high quality medical preparedness for chemical
agent emergencies. Appendix A is a summary of important questions to ask when evaluating medical preparedness in
the civilian prehospital and hospital environments. The prehospital environment encompasses all areas outside
both the installation boundaries and the hospital grounds. People potentially affected in the prehospital environment
include the general public, and first responders. First responders include police, sheriff's, and fire department
personnel, hazardous materials response teams, and medical response teams (including emergency medical technicians,
paramedics, and any other medically-trained personnel responding to the site of injury with the ambulance teams).
The hospital environment includes primarily the emergency department but encompasses outside areas which might
be used for triage and decontamination and other hospital departments which might support the hospital's response.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for patients exposed to chemicals
while protecting themselves from secondary contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that such equipment protects the skin, eyes, and respiratory tracts of the emergency responders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use DA battledress overgarments (BDOs) and portable air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with an organic vapor
cartridge to protect civilians from chemical warfare agents. BDOs can be used for up to 24 hours in an agent-contaminated
environment at levels of up to 10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. Notwithstanding this recommendation,
however, civilian emergency responders should use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that
the equipment used is at least as protective as the above CDC recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train personnel required to use personal protective equipment when responding to chemical agent-related
emergencies in accordance with the guidelines published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. First Responders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Ensure that all persons (e.g., medics, paramedics, fire fighters, or medical personnel) designated by the
State or local disaster plans as members of the initial medical team that responds to a chemical warfare agent release
have the appropriate level of PPE and are trained in its proper use (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that equipment of first responders is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
adequately maintained
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and available at all times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule regular drills and training sessions designed to maintain first responders' familiarity with equipment
into State and local disaster plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Public
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CDC does not recommend distributing PPE (e.g., gas masks or protective suits) to the public. In the unlikely event
that a chemical agent release threatens the civilian population adjacent to a military facility, CDC recommends
the following graded emergency response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Evacuate the population at risk in accordance with State or local disaster management guidelines. If no local
guidelines exist, follow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and DA joint guidelines for evacuating
civilian populations threatened by chemical warfare agents (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Follow FEMA and DA recommendations for sheltering the population in place (e.g., keep people in their homes,
institutions, or places of business and seal windows and doors from an external vapor threat) if it is not practical
to evacuate the population (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decontamination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decontamination is the careful and systematic removal of hazardous substances from victims, equipment, and the
environment. Transporting contaminated patients exposes emergency response personnel to chemical warfare agents
and contaminates rescue vehicles. Proper decontamination prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury
to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination guidelines for persons who may possibly have been exposed
to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontamination of patients can be achieved by mechanically removing, diluting, absorbing, or neutralizing
the chemical agent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Decontaminate all persons who may possibly have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent before they
are transported to a hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontamination substances should be readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include
soap, water, and 5% hypochlorite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To protect the environment, include in State and local disaster plans a method for containing and disposing
of contaminated runoff. CDC does not recommend establishing fixed decontamination units in prehospital areas because
of the expense and inflexibility of such units.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
At a minimum, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
train persons designated as prehospital medical responders in evaluating patients exposed to chemical warfare
agents, managing patients' airways (excluding intubation), transporting patients, and decontaminating patients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train prehospital responders who have been designated in State or local disaster plans to operate in environments
contaminated by a chemical warfare agent in the proper use of PPE in accordance with OSHA guidelines (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at a minimum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, physicians who have been designated in State and local disaster plans to provide medical supervision for prehospital
emergency responders and medical care for victims of a chemical agent release receive specialized training through
continuing education in the emergency response areas specified for prehospital responders.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Patient Triage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The basic premise of patient triage, to provide maximum benefit to the greatest number of victims, is of utmost
importance during a mass-casualty event involving chemical agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have the most experienced responder conduct triage operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base decisions regarding patient triage on local resources, the extent of patient contamination, the type
of chemical warfare agent to which the patient is exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the likelihood of additional
traumatic injuries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Inform the public appropriately, accurately, and rapidly about chemical agent exposures that have or may
have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establish, through the local emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital community, a coordinated public
information policy for chemical emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Contact local and regional news media in advance to establish an accurate and rapid way of disseminating critical
information to the public concerning a chemical agent emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that hospital and EMS personnel coordinate their plans to provide public information with the plans
of those who have overall responsibility for emergency response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Communication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Medical personnel must have access to the emergency communication network 24 hours a day. Such a network should link
the chemical agent depot, local and regional EMS, and all potential receiving hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have medical personnel demonstrate the ability to access the emergency communications network during any
evaluation of preparedness for a chemical warfare release into civilian communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that the hospitals' emergency communications system allows hospital personnel to verify rapidly
whether a chemical warfare agent release has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Transporting Exposed Victims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Coordinate the transportation of chemical agent-exposed victims with the overall disaster response plan,
and include a method for tracking transported patients during an emergency response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transport patients only after they have been properly decontaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transport decontaminated patients to medical facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics, and urgent care centers).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Formal agreements such as memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between organizations that transport patients
and the medical facilities that receive them must be part of the planning process. Medical facilities designated
to receive should be capable of evaluating and managing patients exposed to chemical agents as described later in
the hospital section (Section IV) of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base decisions regarding urgent and emergency transfers of decontaminated patients on the capabilities
of the receiving facilities, transportation resources, demand for hospital services, and the clinical condition
of the patients. Certain medical care (e.g., for burns, pediatric emergencies, trauma, or pulmonary complications)
might require prearrangements for patients to be transferred to a tertiary treatment center. CDC recommends that
transfer and evacuation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plans 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for victims exposed to chemical warfare agents call for land_rather than air_transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Medical Evaluation and Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Train medical response personnel specifically to assess and manage patients exposed to chemical agents stored
at the nearby military depot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontaminate all exposed patients as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide medical treatment (during or after contamination), according to accepted treatment modalities,
to patients exposed to nerve or mustard agents. If antidotes to nerve agents are used in the field by civilian medical
responders as designated in State or local disaster plans, CDC recommends using single-dose, pre-armed autoinjectors,
unless a higher level of medical response has already been integrated into EMS operations. Additional information
on the effects of chemical warfare agents and accepted medical protocols for caring for patients exposed to mustard
or nerve agents is available (5&hyph;14). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Recommendations for Hospital Preparedness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Primary Receiving Hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A primary receiving hospital is a hospital that is designated by State or local disaster plans to provide initial medical
care to the civilian population in the event of a chemical warfare agent release. Such hospitals must have established
protocols detailing evaluation, decontamination, and treatment procedures for patients exposed to chemical warfare
agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Include evaluation, treatment, and decontamination protocols in the hospitals' disaster plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Include chemical warfare agent scenarios in disaster drills for hospitals that have been designated in State
or local disaster plans to receive patients exposed to chemical warfare agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Triage Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 allow patients exposed to a chemical warfare agent to enter the emergency department without adequate evaluation
and decontamination. Signs of mustard agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, in particular, may require 24&hyph;48 hours before they become clinically evident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to perform triage during an emergency related
to chemical warfare agents to recognize the physical signs and symptoms of patients who have been exposed to such agents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base modifications to patient triage procedures on the extent of patient contamination, the type of chemical
warfare agent to which the patient has been exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the possibility of additional
traumatic injuries. Priorities for medical treatment of patients should be determined by the most appropriately
trained and experienced medical professional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Address issues related to emergency department security during disasters in the hospital disaster plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Restrict access to the hospital to prevent contaminated patients from entering the hospital. During a chemical
agent release, security personnel should direct all patients to enter the hospital only through the triage area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decontamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Decontaminate all persons who may have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent. Proper decontamination
prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination
guidelines for persons exposed to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have decontamination substances readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include soap,
water, and 5% hypochlorite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the hospital disaster plan, detail a method for catching contaminated runoff from patients whether decontamination
is done inside or outside the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
At a minimum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, be capable of decontaminating at least one nonambulatory patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;During and after chemical agent releases that cause mass casualties, decontaminate patients outdoors. Having
indoor decontamination facilities does not obviate a hospital's need to have plans for decontaminating patients
outdoors during mass casualty situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Design hospital disaster plans, keeping in mind the possibility of integrating local emergency response
resources. Such resources could include hazardous materials emergency response teams or portable decontamination
vehicles or facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In cold weather, set up temporary shelters and heaters to protect patients from extreme environmental conditions
when undergoing decontamination outdoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have in place a method of controlling the flow of air in the decontamination area to prevent such air from contaminating
other areas of the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Set up a system to allow medical personnel in the decontamination area to be in continuous communication with
other medical personnel in the emergency department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for chemically exposed patients
while protecting themselves from secondary contamination. This equipment must protect the skin, eyes, and respiratory
tracts of the responders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use DA BDOs and PAPRs with organic vapor cartridges to protect civilian personnel against chemical warfare
agents. The BDO can be used in an agent-contaminated environment for up to 24 hours at contamination levels of up to
10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have hospital personnel follow Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) guidelines when managing patients exposed to unknown chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have hospital emergency responders use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that such
equipment is at least as protective as the equipment recommended by CDC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train response personnel to use PPE when responding to a chemical agent emergency according to OSHA guidelines
(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Level of Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to provide direct patient care during a chemical
warfare agent emergency to a level of medical preparedness that allows them to assess, decontaminate, and manage
the treatment of victims of chemical warfare agent releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical staff who are required to wear decontamination attire in decontamination procedures must receive
training in the use of PPE according to OSHA regulations (2&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Transportation of Patients to Other Medical Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Have prearranged written agreements with those medical facilities that agree to accept patients who are exposed
to military chemical agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Do not transfer patients without notifying the hospital and having the patient accepted by a physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have standardized forms available to record patient information and management status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Specific Antidotes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Have decontaminating solutions available in the emergency department. If nerve agents are stored adjacent
to the civilian community, have atropine in multiple-dose units available in the emergency department and in the
hospital pharmacy. In addition, have the hospital pharmacy stock atropine and pralidoxime in sufficient quantities
to cope with the anticipated number of patients who could be managed by that facility in response to a chemical warfare
agent release. Atropine and pralidoxime should be administered intravenously in the emergency environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Hospital Disaster Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Include plans for providing medical care for patients exposed to chemical agents in the hospital's disaster
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have in place a method for using the emergency communication system so that reports of a chemical warfare agent
release can be verified rapidly. Also include provisions to coordinate activities with State and local disaster
plans for mass decontamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Include in disaster drills scenarios in which patients have become exposed to chemical warfare agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use the hospital quality assurance program to review disaster drills and decontamination procedures and
to assist in maintaining the professional skills of hospital personnel necessary to treat the effects of exposure
to a chemical warfare agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

10. Tertiary Hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A tertiary receiving hospital is a hospital that receives referrals from primary receiving hospitals. Additional
services such as burn care, psychiatric service, and toxicologic consultation are available at the level of care.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that tertiary hospitals designated by State or local disaster plans to provide care for persons exposed
to chemical warfare agents have, at a minimum, emergency response capabilities similar to those of the primary receiving
hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that tertiary hospitals coordinate their disaster plans with State and local disaster plans for mass
decontamination of persons exposed to chemical warfare agents.

Appendix A Summary of Important Medical Preparedness Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Communities Surrounding Chemical Agent Stockpiles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Do the communities that surround chemical warfare agent depots have a disaster plan that details the role of the
prehospital and hospital medical community during a chemical warfare agent emergency? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If medical personnel are designated to treat chemical warfare agent casualties, do they have adequate training
to meet minimal standards for evaluating, decontaminating, and treating victims of a chemical warfare agent release?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do medical personnel who are designated by State, local, and hospital disaster plans to use PPE in response to an
emergency related to chemical warfare agents have the necessary OSHA level of training to use these devices effectively
and safely? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the local disaster plan has provisions to evacuate or transfer patients to other hospitals for further treatment
and evaluation, do existing MOUs cover the transfer of chemically contaminated patients? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Do hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans have an adequate stockpile of antidotes and decontamination
solutions to provide complete medical treatment to at least one chemically contaminated patient? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Are hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans able to decontaminate at least one nonambulatory patient
exposed to chemical warfare agent? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Do the disaster plans of hospitals named to receive patients by State and local disaster plans have specific provisions
which detail how they will control access to their medical facilities during a chemical warfare agent emergency?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Are all levels of the medical community that are designated by State or local disaster plans to respond to a chemical
warfare agent emergency able to communicate via either the State or local disaster communication network?

Open committee discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In April 1992, the Generic Drugs Advisory Committee met to consider methods for documenting the bioequivalence
of topical corticosteroids. Subsequently, on July 1, 1992, the Office of Generic Drugs issued a guidance document
entitled ``Interim Guidance for Topical Corticosteroids: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In Vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Bioequivalence and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In Vitro
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Release Methods.'' The purpose of the September 1994 meeting is to reexamine the 1992 interim guidance in light of
new experimental data and methods of analysis. On September 12, 1994, the committee will discuss the pharmacodynamic
(i.e., vasoconstrictor) measurement of bioequivalence. On September 13, 1994, this topic will be further discussed
along with other issues related to the documentation of equivalence according to the interim guidance. Discussion
will be limited to dermatologic products and will not include ophthalmic or inhaled corticosteroid products. Also,
on September 13, 1994, there will be a review of the current status of topics discussed at previous Generic Drugs advisory
committee meetings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2)
an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory
committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Through a review of elk habitat management in the Wells Resource Area, it was determined that elk numbers and habitat
use areas are expanding from those identified in the Wells RMP Record of Decision, approved July 16, 1985. Elk are recognized
as highly adaptable creatures and during recent years have pioneered to adjacent previously unoccupied habitats
in the Wells Resource Area from the Pilot Mountain Management Area, northwestern Utah and southern Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this amendment is to establish elk habitat management areas, identify habitat requirements and specific
management objectives and practices, establish target elk population management levels, develop factors for attainment
and future adjustments in elk population management levels, and identify constraints on other resources within
the Wells Resource Area.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing recovery measures needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote conservation of
a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal
agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Texas trailing phlox is an endangered species known from one site on private land in Tyler County and one population
in Hardin County located mostly on land owned by The Nature Conservancy, with a few plants occurring on adjoining roadside
rights-of-way and private property. The plant is restricted to sandy soils in open pine woodlands. Texas trailing
phlox is threatened primarily by habitat loss due to canopy closure, encroachment of hardwood trees, and soil disturbance
associated with human activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Texas trailing phlox recovery plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in Region 2. The plan will
be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment period.

to import giant pandas. The purpose for which the permit is requested has now been modified to focus on scientific research
investigating olfactory communication and how it relates to giant panda reproductive physiology and sexual behavior
and habitat use. In addition, a female captive-born panda has now been substituted for the female wild-caught animal
identified in the initial import request.

Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Blacksville No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01968)
located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in certain areas of the
return air course, traveling the entire area would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish check points 1
and 2 to monitor the methane and quantity of air in the affected area; to have a qualified person conduct these tests
weekly at each check point and record the results in a book kept on the surface and made available for inspection by interested
persons; and to install a door in the overcast on the mainline track haulage in order to observe the mine roof over the
overcast once a day to determine whether a roof fall and possible collapse of the overcast exists. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Drummond Company, Inc., P.O. Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.800 (high-voltage circuits; circuit breakers) to its Shoal Creek Mine (I.D. No. 01&hyph;02901) located
in Jefferson County, Alabama. The petitioner requests a modification of that portion of the standard that pertains
to under-voltage, grounded phase, overcurrent, and ground check opening the circuit breaker. The petitioner proposes
to use high-voltage contactors with an electrical rating adequate for the connected load; to use under-voltage,
overload, grounded phase, and ground check protective devices that would de-energize the high-voltage contactor;
to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage circuit that would preclude automatic closing of the high-voltage
contactor when there is an under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; to use a control circuit
design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote closing of the high-voltage contactor when there
is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage
circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage
circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard.

or ground check problem; to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote
closing of the high-voltage contactor when there is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use
a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would
preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Dynamic Recovery, Inc., P.O. Box 25, Clarksville, Pennsylvania 15322 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1103&hyph;4(a) (automatic fire sensor and warning device systems; installation; minimum requirements)
to its Lazarus Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08336) located in Greene County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to
install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection system in all belt entries
where a monitoring system would identify a sensor location instead of in each belt flight. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

petitioner propose to load each hole as soon as it has been drilled, then move to the next hole, continue until the end
of the shift, and then continue loading on subsequent shifts until the pattern is completed. Then, the round would
be wired and shot as soon as possible. The petitioner states that returning to the collapsed holes to redrill would
cause hazardous conditions. In addition, the petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would prevent
a diminution of safety.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

Proposed Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to the purchase of certain
real property (the Property) by the Plan from Pipefitters Local 195 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices
of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the Union), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the
following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An independent fiduciary determines that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The fair market value of the Property is established by an appraiser unrelated to the Plan or the Union; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Plan pays no more than the lesser of $462,800 or the fair market value of the Property as determined at the time
of purchase; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The purchase is a one-time transaction for cash; and

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan established and administered pursuant to the provisions of section
302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 580 participants and total assets
of $1,248,499. On the same date, the number of employers contributing to the Plan totaled 21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Property consists of 2.74 acres of land and improvements located adjacent to property of the Union. The improvements
include three one and two-story buildings, constructed by the Union in 1968 and 1978, designed for use as classroom
and apprenticeship training facilities for the Plan and its participants. From 1968 to 1988 the Plan operated an apprenticeship
program on the Property pursuant to a lease of the Property by the Union to the Plan.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In August 1988 the Union sold the Property to the Plan. The Plan partially financed this purchase by obtaining a loan
from the Sabine Area Pipefitters Local 195 Pension Trust Fund (Local 195 Pension Plan). The Local 195 Pension Plan,
which was later merged into the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, had interlocking trustees with the
Plan and the Plan made some contributions to the Local 195 Pension Plan on behalf of its participants. The loan was repaid
in June 1991.

Prohibited transaction exemption (PTE) 78&hyph;5 (43 FR 23024, May 30, 1978) permits, under certain conditions,
the leasing of real property by an apprenticeship plan from a sponsoring employee organization. The Department expresses
no opinion as to whether the above lease satisfied the conditions of PTE 78&hyph;5 nor is any relief provided herein.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In September 1990 the Department commenced an investigation of the Plan regarding the sale of the Property by the Union
to the Plan and the loan between the Plan and the Local 195 Pension Plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Also, an application for exemption for retroactive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act
was submitted to the Department for these transactions. In a letter in January 1992, the Department cited as reasons
for denying the exemption application, among other factors, the lack of the review and prior approval of the transactions
by an independent fiduciary. Following this exemption denial, an agreement was reached with the Department which
required that the Property be sold back by the Plan to the Union. Such sale occurred in December 1992. Since that date,
the Plan has utilized the Property as a training facility without charge from the Union. However, the applicant represents
that because of an economic downturn in the area, the Union considers it a hardship to continue this arrangement.

The above described transactions may have constituted prohibited transactions under section 406 of the Act. Such
section prohibits, in part, a sale or exchange of property between a plan and a party in interest, a use of plan assets
for the benefit of a party in interest, and the acting of a fiduciary in a plan transaction on behalf of a party whose interests
are adverse to those of the plan or its participants.

3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property on January 14, 1994, from Donnie M. Jones, MAI (Jones), a real
estate appraiser located in Port Arthur, Texas. Jones represents that he is not related in any way to the Plan or the
Union. Utilizing the income, cost and sales comparison approaches to value, Jones estimated that the Property had
a fair market value of $462,800 as of the date of the appraisal. By letter dated March 1, 1994, Jones stated that he was
aware, in preparing the appraisal, that the Plan was the prospective buyer of the Property and that this knowledge
had no influence on his calculation of value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan now proposes to purchase the Property from the Union so that the Plan itself will own the training and educational
facilities used to train journeymen and apprentices. Plan fiduciaries note that ownership of the Property will give
the Plan full control of the buildings, grounds and parking lots and will enable the Plan to make improvements to the
Property as needed. The Plan will pay no more than current fair market value for the Property, as established by an updated
independent appraisal. The purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions
in regard to the purchase. The applicant represents that, after the purchase of the Property, the Plan will have more
than enough funds for operational purposes of the training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Plan and the Union have selected Joseph P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors, Sr. (Connors), an attorney with the firm of Connors Associates, Inc. in Washington, D.C. to serve as independent
fiduciary in regard to the proposed transaction. The applicant represents that Connors is independent of the Plan
and the Union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors states that he has had extensive experience working with Taft-Hartley plans, including serving as chairman
of funds of the United Mine Workers. Connors further states that he is well aware that while acting as independent fiduciary
he assumes personal liability and he must act solely in the interest of the Plan and its participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors maintains that the proposed transaction is definitely in the best interests of the Plan. In this regard, Connors
has met with officers of the Union and trustees of the Plan and has made an inspection of the Property with Russell Allen,
the training director for the Plan. The Plan has operated an apprenticeship program utilizing the Property since
the initial time of construction in 1968. As independent fiduciary, Connors will make certain that the Plan pays no
more than fair market value for the Property and will enforce all rights of the Plan in regard to the proposed transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) the purchase of the Property will give the Plan ownership of the facilities it uses for
its apprenticeship training program; (2) an independent fiduciary has determined that the proposed transaction
is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants; (3) the Plan will pay no more than fair market value for the
Property, based on an updated independent appraisal; (4) the purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(5) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Proposed Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section
406(a), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the
Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale)
of certain shares of stock (the Shares) from certain individually-directed accounts in the Plan (the Accounts) to
Lewis-Gale Clinic, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Clinic), a party in interest with respect to the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed exemption is conditioned on the following requirements: (1) the terms and conditions of the Sale are
at least as favorable to the Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party;
(2) the Sale is a one-time cash transaction; (3) the Accounts are not required to pay any commissions, costs or other
expenses in connection with the Sale; (4) the Sales price for the Shares is based upon its fair market value as determined
by a qualified, independent appraiser; and (5) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic
files Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited
transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan sponsored by the Clinic, a Virginia professional corporation owned exclusively
by licensed physicians engaged in the practice of medicine. The Clinic employs 837 full-time and part-time employees
of which 124 are licensed physicians. The Clinic services the Greater Roanoke Valley with a central location located
in Salem, Virginia. The Clinic also operates various satellite clinics in towns and counties within a fifty mile radius
of its primary location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. As of March 31, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $58,733,461 and 690 participants. The Plan permits each participant
to direct the investments of his or her account among several funds including a fund commonly referred to as Fund F.
First Union National Bank of Virginia (First Union) serves as trustee of all Plan assets except those held in Fund F.
The board of directors of the Clinic serves as the trustee with respect to the Plan assets held in Fund F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Fund F is designed to be invested exclusively in the common stock of the Lewis-Gale Building Corporation (the Building
Corporation), which was incorporated on December 22, 1970. From the time of such incorporation until 1983, all of
the outstanding common stock of the Building Corporation (the Stock) was owned exclusively by the physicians and
certain administrative personnel. The primary purpose of the Building Corporation is to own and operate certain
real property facilities which are leased to the Clinic and other health care providers for use in rendering medical
services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clinic represents that the Building Corporation is a real estate operating company within the meaning of 29 CFR
2510.3&hyph;101(e). Therefore, with regard to any ownership by the Plan, the Building Corporation's assets are
not considered plan assets. However, the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the underlying assets of the
Building Corporation contain plan assets under 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. As a condition to employment, each physician is contractually required to purchase a fixed dollar amount of the
Stock. In 1983, the Building Corporation and the physicians, upon the advice of counsel, amended the Plan and the pre-existing
stock restriction agreement to permit the Plan to acquire the Stock, thereby allowing the physicians to satisfy their
contractual obligations to purchase the Stock by self-directing portions of their individual account balances
into Fund F.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that the decisions of the fiduciaries on behalf of the Plan, in connection with the acquisition
and holding of the Building Corporation Stock are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part
4, Subpart B of Title I. In this regard, the Department herein is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 of
the Act which may have arisen as a result of the investment in and subsequent holding of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Stock is not publicly traded, the Building Corporation values the Stock on an annual basis using its historic
valuation formula under the existing stock purchase agreement between the Building Corporation and its shareholders.
The valuation formula incorporates the fair market values of the underlying assets of the Building Corporation,
which are valued annually by a qualified, independent real estate appraiser. The Building Corporation has consistently
utilized this valuation formula to set the price per share for all sale and purchase transactions involving the Stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fund F has experienced an average annual rate of return of 11.3 percent, and investment in this fund is open to all participants
in the Plan. As of May 11, 1994, Fund F held 16,413 shares (the Shares) of the Stock which represents approximately eighty-two
percent of the issued and outstanding shares of the Stock. The remaining issued and outstanding shares of the Stock
are owned by physicians and certain administrators. The terms of Fund F require a participant electing to invest in
Stock to remain invested in Fund F until his or her death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment.
Upon such occurrences, a number of shares of the Stock equal to the value of such participant's Fund F account balance
will be sold back to the Building Corporation for cash and such cash proceeds distributed to the participant as a part
of his or her Plan account balance.

5. Between 1988 and 1990, thirteen physicians (the Physicians), upon the advice of counsel, sold their individual
shares of the Stock for cash to their individually-directed accounts in the Plan indirectly through the Building
Corporation. Three of the Physicians were officers of the Clinic. The Clinic states that, as an indirect result of
these sales, some of the accounts of the Physicians held shares of the Stock in excess of twenty-five percent of the
balance of their account at some point. Because of the party in interest/ disqualified person relationships and the
past purchases by the accounts from the Physicians, the Clinic is aware of the fact that prohibited transactions have
occurred in violation of the Act. Accordingly, the Clinic represents that within ninety days of the grant of this proposed
exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes
due with respect to past prohibited transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the administrative difficulties involved in locating certain Physicians who were involved in these prohibited
purchases by their accounts, the Clinic has represented that it will be responsible for the filing of the Forms 5330
and the payment of all applicable excise taxes resulting from these prohibited purchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Upon discovering that certain accounts in the Plan had engaged in prohibited transactions, the board of directors,
acting as trustee, froze the assets in Fund F pending resolution of the prohibited transaction issues. As a result,
retiring participants are limited to receiving only a partial distribution. In order to allow participants to receive
full distributions, the trustee proposes to sell the Shares to the Clinic. Accordingly, the Clinic requests an administrative
exemption from the Department to permit the Sale under the terms and conditions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sale will be a one time cash transaction, and the Accounts will pay no fees or commissions in connection with the
Sale. Prior to the Sale, First Union will become trustee with respect to the Plan assets in Fund F. At this time, First
Union will have the sole investment discretion over the entire assets of the Plan. Although the initial decision to
sell the Shares was made by the board of directors acting as trustee, First Union will have the ultimate authority to

7. The Clinic obtained an appraisal of the Stock dated May 13, 1994, from Dianne D. Cobb, CFA, ASA. Ms. Cobb is the Senior
Vice President of Investment Managements Services of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina which provides analysis with
regard to non-publicly traded securities and securities of closely held businesses. Ms. Cobb represents that both
she and Wachovia Bank of North Carolina are unrelated to and independent of the Clinic and its affiliates. Relying
upon the discounted future cash flow and recent trades of the Stock, Ms. Cobb placed the fair market value of the Stock
at $764 per share. Based on this valuation, the value of the Shares, which represent Fund F's eighty-two percent interest
in the Building Corporation, total $12,539,532. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms and conditions of the Sale will be at least as favorable to the
Plan as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Sale will be a one-time cash
transaction; (c) the Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the
Sale; and (d) the Sales price for the Shares will be based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent
appraiser; and (e) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with
the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited transactions.

Proposed Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed extension of credit by Raytech Corporation (Raytech) to the Plans
in the form of payments (the Makeup Payments) with respect to group annuity contract CG01274B3A (the GIC) issued by
Executive Life Insurance Company (ELIC); and (2) the Plans' potential repayment of the Makeup Payments (the Repayments),
provided: (a) all terms of such transactions are no less favorable to the Plans than those which the Plans could obtain
in arm's-length transactions with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses are paid by the Plans; (c) the
Makeup Payments are made only in lieu of payments due from ELIC with respect to the accumulated book value of the GIC
at the time of the Makeup Payments; (d) the Repayments are restricted to the amounts, if any, paid to the Plans after
March 27, 1994, by ELIC or other responsible third parties with respect to the GIC (the GIC Proceeds); (e) the Repayments
do not exceed the total amount of the Makeup Payments; and (f) the Repayments are waived to the extent the Makeup Payments
exceed the GIC Proceeds.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Raytech is a multi-national manufacturer and marketer of specialty engineered products for heat resistant, inertia
control, energy absorption and transmission applications. In 1988, Raytech became the sponsor of the Plans, which
are defined contribution plans under section 401(k) of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Salaried Plan currently has 281 participants and beneficiaries, and has assets with an approximate aggregate
fair market value of $9,793,000. The Hourly Plan currently has 236 participants and beneficiaries, and has assets
with an approximate aggregate fair market value of $1,051,000. Effective January 1, 1994, Charles Schwab Trust Company
(the Trustee) was appointed as trustee to the Plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Investments of funds contributed under the Plans are made by the Trustee as directed by participants in accordance
with provisions of the Plans. In 1988, the Plans provided two investment options: (i) a ``Guaranteed Interest Fund''
in which the monies were to be held under a contract or contracts issued by one or more major insurance companies providing
for a stipulated minimum rate of interest, as selected by the Plans' administrative committee (the Committee) or
(ii) a ``Managed Securities Fund'', consisting of a mutual fund managed by a bank which was selected by the Committee.
Under the provisions of the Salaried Plan, Raytech's matching contributions could be delivered in cash or Raytech
common stock at the direction of Raytech's Board of Directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In 1992, both Plans were amended, revising the name of the Equity Fund from ``Managed Security Fund'' to ``Equity
Fund'', and the Salaried Plan was amended to add an additional investment option in a Balanced Fund as selected by the
Committee. In 1993, both Plans were amended to change the Guaranteed Interest Fund option. Prior to this amendment,
the Guaranteed Interest Fund provided for monies contributed in a particular year to be held by a single insurance
company (e.g., ELIC). Pursuant to this amendment, the Plans now permit investments in a ``pooled investment fund''
that features insurance company contracts issued by multiple insurance companies. Under the terms of each of the
Plans, the participants have withdrawal and transfer rights with respect to their accounts (Withdrawal Events).
The circumstances triggering Withdrawal Events include severance from service, disability, retirement, death,
hardship, transfer of funds and loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The GIC was issued by ELIC to the Plans in 1988. Employee savings contributions directed to the Guaranteed Interest
Fund and related Raytech contributions were invested in the GIC during 1988. As of April 11, 1991, total principal
deposited under the GIC plus accumulated interest under the GIC, less previous withdrawals (the Accumulated Book
Value) for the Plans amounted to $1,774,779. On April 11, 1991 (the Conservation Date), ELIC was seized by the California
Insurance Commissioner and its assets were frozen and its payments suspended, including the GIC.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Effective September 3, 1993 (the Closing Date), the California Superior Court approved a rehabilitation/liquidation
plan (the Rehab Plan).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Rehab Plan provides for the resolution of ELIC's contractual obligations.

breach of fiduciary duties under the Act in connection with the purchase of a group annuity contract from ELIC to fund
the benefits of three Raymark pension plans following an investigation that began in June, 1991. The Department notes
that the exemption proposed herein is not intended to affect any cause of action by any participant of the Plans or the
Department with respect to the GIC.

6. Pursuant to the Rehab Plan, an interim benefit payment (the Interim Payment) was received by the Plans in the combined
amount of $288,528 in September, 1993. In January, 1994, the Plans were provided an option to elect to participate
in the Rehab Plan or to opt out. Notice was given that the contract values and terms of the original GIC had been adjusted
down as required by the Rehab Plan. The Plans were advised that there was no participating state guaranty association,
and thus no such source of makeup funds. The Plans' Committees elected to opt out of the Rehab Plan, and the GIC was surrendered
(see rep. 8, below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Under the Rehab Plan, a new insurance company, Aurora, was created to receive the ELIC assets. ELIC contractholders,
however, were not forced to invest in the new company and could opt out. Upon opting out, however, the ELIC contractholders
were to receive only a portion of their Accumulated Book Value, or a reduction of 31.5%. After that reduction, further
amounts were to be held back to cover potential liabilities from ELIC indemnities in the sale of the assets and ongoing
litigation concerning allocation of the ELIC assets, leaving the balance for the first opt out payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the first opt out payment, the Rehab Plan provides for future potential payments as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) distributions from enhancement trusts; and (b) release of holdbacks. These are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three enhancement trusts were created at the ELIC sale to protect certain ELIC assets that were not part of the sale,
one for real estate, one for below grade stocks and bonds, and one for ELIC rights not transferred. All of these assets
are to be liquidated by the enhancement trusts over time and the proceeds distributed to the ELIC contractholders.
As required by the Rehab Plan, a specified amount was held back to cover the indemnity and allocation contingencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The holdback amounts, if any remain, will be released to the participants in the future if not used to cover the indemnities
and allocation litigation result. The Rehab Plan provided no assurance that there would be distributions from enhancement
trusts or releases of holdbacks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The opt out provision of the Rehab Plan was equivalent to a repurchase of the GIC in return for the opt out payment.
Having elected to opt out, the Plans on March 27, 1994, received the first opt out payment in the amount of $730,912.
When added to the Interim Payment (see rep. 6, above) of $288,528, the Plans have received a total of $1,019,440 from
ELIC. In addition, approximately $200,000 was held back by ELIC (see rep. 7, above). When the opt out payment was received,
the Plans surrendered the GIC to Aurora. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Following the receipt of the first opt out payment and assuming no future payments from the enhancement trusts or
from the holdback, each affected participant in the Plans will have lost approximately 42% of his/her account balance
invested in the GIC as of the Conservation Date of April 11, 1991. The applicant represents that the realization of
these losses and uncertainties surrounding the ELIC situation have caused substantial concern and anxiety among
the Plans' participants. In order to relieve the affected participants' concerns, to protect the participants'
accounts invested in the GIC, and to restore to the Plans the ability to fulfill obligations with respect to Withdrawal
Events involving amounts invested in the GIC, Raytech desires to make up the losses the participants have suffered
as a result of the investment in the GIC by way of the Makeup Payments. The Makeup Payments have been calculated as follows:

The totals that should have been earned match the payments made by ELIC (Interim Payment plus first opt out payment)
plus the Makeup Payment. (The totals will increase to account for interest at 6.19% up to the actual Makeup Payment
date.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Makeup Payments, which are shown in the above chart, have been calculated in order to restore to the Plans the full
Accumulated Book Value of the GIC as of March 27, 1994 (the date of the first opt out payment), which is $2,261,278. In
addition, the applicant represents that it will pay interest to the Plans up to the actual Makeup Payment date at a rate
of 6.19%, since funds invested in the GIC would have been rolled over by the Trustee into the Hartford Insurance Company
GIC, having a guaranteed interest rate of 6.19% and expiring December 31, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Raytech is prepared and able to contribute the above-calculated Makeup Payments plus interest to the Plans to
eliminate the participants' losses and future payment contingencies. The first opt out payments (including the
Interim Payment) and the Raytech Makeup Payments will fully restore the participants' accounts. Immediately following
the granting of the exemption proposed herein and the execution of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
pursuant to Rev. Proc. 92&hyph;16, the Makeup Payment will be contributed directly to the Trustee, who is obligated
under the terms of the Plans to invest the contribution directly into the Guaranteed Interest Fund. As future payments
from the enhancement trusts or return of holdbacks are received, the Trustee is to pay such amounts over to Raytech
to reimburse it for that portion of the Makeup Payments. The transaction can be characterized as a non-interest bearing
loan by Raytech to the Plans requiring no security or collateralization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The applicant represents that the losses suffered by the affected participants are known numbers since the Rehab
Plan has been implemented and the payment has been made except for enhancement trusts and holdbacks. In the absence
of the Makeup Payments, such participants stand to lose 42% of their account balances as of the Conservation Date of
April 11, 1991 and interest since such date totaling approximately $1,242,000. To summarize, Raytech is proposing
to make up the lost amounts and to cover the amounts not paid due to the enhancement trusts and the holdbacks under the
Rehab Plan. Raytech is looking to recoup such amounts only to the extent that they are subsequently paid under the Rehab
Plan.

408(a) of the Act because: (a) all terms of the transactions will be no less favorable to the Plans than those which the
Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses will be

2. The assets of all five Plans are held in the Master Trust. Each Plan holds units of participation representing an
undivided interest in the assets of the Master Trust. As of December 31, 1993, the total amount of Plan assets held in
the Master Trust was approximately $95,000,000. The terms of the Plans permit participants to direct the investment
of their accounts under the Plans. Each of the Plans provides its participants the option of investing in any of six
mutual funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company, including the Interest Income Fund. The GICs,
which were acquired directly by the Master Trust, are considered part of the Interest Income Fund. The Interest Income
Fund has investments in several guaranteed investment contracts. On April 4, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC
A (

California. The Employer represents that Executive Life ceased payments on the GICs upon commencement of the conservatorship.
The effect of the conservatorship has been to freeze all assets invested in the GICs. This freeze has prevented Plan
participants from exercising their rights under the Plans to request distributions, loans, withdrawals and investment
transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GICs.

The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GICs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility

for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GICs issued by Executive
Life.

4. The Employer proposes to make the Advances to the Master Trust in a series of payments, pursuant to a written loan
agreement (the Agreement). The total amount of Advances will not exceed the aggregate account balances of the Plans'
participants attributable to the GICs as of April 11, 1991,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 adjusted for interest, as follows: Commencing on the date the Employer and the Internal Revenue Service enter into
a closing agreement pursuant to Internal Revenue Procedure 92&hyph;16,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Employer represents that it wishes to enter into the proposed transaction in order to protect the Plan participants
from the effects of a prolonged rehabilitation process and from any potential loss resulting from Executive Life's
inability to meet its obligations under the GICs. In this regard, the Employer represents that the Plans' participants
will benefit from the proposed transaction because the Advances will ensure that the participants receive 100% of
the conservatorship date value of their accounts and such amounts will be available as soon as approval is received
from the Internal Revenue Service and the Department.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Employer further represents that the Advances will facilitate benefit distributions, loans, hardship withdrawals
and investment transfers which would not otherwise be possible because of Executive Life's suspension of payments
under the GICs. The Employer also represents that the Advances will be non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur
any expenses in connection with the proposed transaction.

5. Repayment of the Advances under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Master Trust by or on behalf of Executive
Life, or its successor, or any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Master Trust will be available
for repayment of the Advances. If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the
Advances, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plans or the Master Trust, or
against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount. To the extent the Master Trust receives
GIC proceeds in excess of the total amount of the Advances, such additional amounts will be retained by the Master Trust
and allocated among the accounts of the Plans' participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plans' ability to timely fund participants' benefits, including
participant loans, hardship withdrawals and participant-directed investment re-allocations; (2) The Master
Trust will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Advances will be made only from
amounts paid to the Master Trust by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the payments by or
on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Advances, the Employer will have no recourse against
the Plans or the Master Trust, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount; and
(5) Repayment of the Advances will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Advances exceed the amount the Master
Trust receives from GIC proceeds.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

University of Washington; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact Regarding
Proposed Renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility License
No. R&hyph;73 for the University of Washington Research Reactor (the licensee) located on the University campus
in Seattle, Washington.

Identification of Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Environmental Assessment is written in connection with the proposed renewal date of February 14, 1999, for the
facility license of the University of Washington Research Reactor (UWRR) at Seattle, Washington, in response to
a timely application from the licensee dated August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994. The proposed
action would authorize possession, but not operation, of the facility, for a period of five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The license for the facility was due to expire on October 13, 1989. The licensee made a timely request for renewal as
a possession only license on August 10 and 31, 1989, for a period of 20 years which was later modified on February 14,
1994 for a period of five years. The proposed action is required to authorize continued possession, but not operation,
of the facility, so that the licensee can complete its decommissioning plan and ultimately decommission the reactor
facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Possession Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An alternative to the proposed action that was considered was not renewing the license. This alternative would have
led to possession of a facility and radioactive material without authorization by law. This alternative did not provide
an acceptable way for the licensee to possess the facility prior to decomissioning, or for decommissioning the facility
in a controlled, coordinated manner. The other alternative was to renew the license for possession only a period of
one year, but this would require license renewals on an annual basis until decommissioning is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reactor is defueled and all special nuclear material and source material have been shipped offsite or transferred
to the State license. The only remaining radioactivity at the facility is activated reactor components. There is
no potential for generation of further radioactive materials. The extension of the facility license as a possession
only license for a five year period allows the licensee time to complete its decommissioning plan and affords it a reasonable
time to implement decommissioning. Further, providing additional time for the licensee to develop and implement
the decommissioning plan should lessen the environmental impact, in that radioactive materials will continue to
be depleted by the decay process and the licensee will have an opportunity to better plan and conduct decommissioning
activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Use of Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources beyond those normally allocated for such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the propose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for a license renewal application dated
August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 30, 1994, the Commission approved a final rule revising 10 CFR Part 73 associated with protection against malevolent
use of vehicles at nuclear power plants. The rule change modifies the design basis threat for radiological sabotage
to include use of a land vehicle. The rule change also requires vehicle control measures, including vehicle barrier
systems, to protect against the malevolent use of a land vehicle. The vehicle barrier system design requires that
the system stop the forward motion of the design basis vehicle.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the implementation of this rule change, the NRC staff is publishing Regulatory Guide 5.68, ``Protection
Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and NUREG/CR&hyph;6190, ``Protection Against Malevolent
Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' Volumes 1 and 2. These documents were specifically developed to provide
guidance acceptable to the NRC staff by which a licensee can meet the requirements of the revised 10 CFR Part 73. The
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will conduct one-day technical workshops in each of the NRC Regional offices
to discuss Regulatory Guide 5.68 and NUREG/CR&hyph;6190, Volumes 1 and 2, and address implementation of the rule
change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC regulations for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a geologic repository
recognize that prohibit designing the repository against the effects of such a potentially adverse condition. The
STP recognizes the acceptability of designing the geologic repository to take into account the attendant effects
(e.g., displacement) of faults of regulatory concern and express the staff's views on what is needed from the U.S.
Department of Energy if it chooses to locate structures, systems, and components important to safety or important
to waste isolation in areas that contain faults of regulatory concern.

On March 18, 1993, NRC published the ``Notice of Availability'' for the draft STP in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(see 58 FR 14594) and solicited public comments. As a result, more than 25 comments were received from four different
parties. The NRC staff reviewed these comments and, as a result, changes and clarifications were incorporated into
the STP. Staff responses to these comments are documented separately as Appendix C to NUREG&hyph;1494.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 24, 1994, the NRC staff briefed the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) on the revised STP following
the end of the public comment period. As a result, the ACNW recommended, without additional comment, that the staff
publish the STP in final form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;53 and DPR&hyph;69, issued to Baltimore Gas and Electric
Company (the licensee), for operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Calvert
County, Maryland.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated March 23, 1994, for an exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power plant
reactors against radiological sabotage.'' The requested exemption would allow the implementation of a hand geometry
biometric system of site access control in conjunction with photograph identification badges, and would allow the
badges to be taken offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee is required to establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system
and security organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies in part that: ``The licensee
shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), specifies in part that: ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for
all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further indicates that an individual
not employed by the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without an escort provided
the individual, ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit
from the protected area.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, unescorted access for both employee and contractor personnel into the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant,
Unit Nos. 1 and 2, is controlled through the use of picture badges. Positive identification of personnel who are authorized
and request access into the protected area is established by security personnel making a visual comparison of the
individual requesting access and that individual's picture badge. The picture badges are issued, stored, and retrieved
at the entrance/exit location to the protected area. These picture badges are not taken offsite. This current practice
is in accordance with the applicable requirements of 10 CFR Part 73 discussed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area. The proposal would also
allow all individuals, including contractors, who have unescorted access to keep their picture badges in their possession
when departing the Calvert Cliffs site. Thus, an exemption is required from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) to allow contractors
who have unescorted access to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Calvert Cliffs site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action. In addition to their picture badges, all individuals
with authorized unescorted access will have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered
with their picture badge number in a computerized access control system. Therefore, all authorized individuals
must not only have their picture badges to gain access into the protected area, but must also have their hand geometry
confirmed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other access processes, including search function capability and access revocation, will remain the same. A
security officer responsible for access control will continue to be positioned within a bullet-resistant structure.
The proposed system is only for individuals with authorized unescorted access and will not be used for individuals
requiring escorts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The underlying purpose for requiring that individuals not employed by the licensee must receive and return their
picture badges at the entrance/exit is to provide reasonable assurance that the access badges could not be compromised
or stolen with a resulting risk that an unauthorized individual could potentially enter the protected area. Although
the proposed exemption will allow individuals to take their picture badges offsite, the proposed measures require
not only that the picture badge be provided for access to the protected area, but also that verification of the hand
geometry registered with the badge be performed as discussed above. Thus, the proposed system provides an identity
verification process that is equivalent to the existing process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the exemption to allow individuals not employed by the licensee to take
their picture badges offsite will not result in an increase in the risk that an unauthorized individual could potentially
enter the protected area. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts
associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed exemption does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the proposed action would be to deny the requested action. Denial of the requested action would not significantly
enhance the environment in that the proposed action will result in a process that is equivalent to the existing identification
verification process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternate Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental
Statement for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental
impact of this proposed action. The State official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's letter dated March 23, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Calvert County Library, Prince Frederick, Maryland

On May 4, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The rule change amends Sections 1(b) and 1(c) to Article III of the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to the By-Laws to clarify
the process by which an applicant applies for membership in the NASD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD amended the proposed rule change three times subsequent to its original filing on March 11, 1994. The first
amendment changed the requirement that an applicant for membership in the NASD submit a copy of its ``current submission
to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 15b1&hyph;2(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934''
to require that the applicant submit ``Form BD filed with the Central Registration Depository.'' This amendment
is technical in nature in that it corrects a deficiency that arose out of the 1992 amendments to the broker-dealer registration
process which deleted Rule 15b1&hyph;2(c) and requires that Form BD be submitted to the NASD. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

registration and reporting requirements).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second amendment reflected the results of the NASD membership vote concerning the NASD's proposed rule change.
The change was submitted to a vote of the NASD membership in NASD

by a vote of 1,879 in favor, 161 opposed, and 6 not voting out of 2,046 ballots received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the third amendment provided minor wording changes to Schedule C of the Schedules to the By-Laws, Part I,
Section 2(f) and further clarified the NASD's basis for proposing certain other changes; this amendment was technical
in nature and did not have any substantive impact.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD seeks to amend its By-Laws and Rules with respect to the procedural aspects of the membership application
process. The NASD has identified instances where its By-Laws and rules are inconsistent and where its actual practices
are inconsistent with its rules. This rule change corrects these aberrations and further clarifies the membership
application process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD By-Laws currently provide that any application for membership shall be referred to the District Committee
of the NASD district in which the applicant has its principal place of business. The By-Laws further provide that the
appropriate District Committee shall determine whether the applicant satisfies the NASD's admission requirements.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In contrast, the NASD's rules, Schedule C to the By-Laws, provide that the District Office staff initially determine
an applicant's eligibility for membership. The rules do, however, further set forth procedures for review by the
District Committee, upon request by the applicant, of the District Office's determination.

According to the NASD, the actual practice is for the appropriate District Committee to determine an applicant's
eligibility for membership. The NASD has determined to amend its By-Laws and Schedule C to allow each District Committee
to designate a Subcommittee to act, under limited circumstances, on behalf of the District Committee. The proposed
rule change, therefore, amends the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to provide that all initial applications for membership
be reviewed by either the District Committee or a Subcommittee of the District Committee, with a right of appeal to
the full District Committee.

The NASD has also amended the By-Laws by deleting the explicit requirement that determinations of the District Committee
(and now Subcommittees designated by the District Committee) be made by a majority of its members. The NASD indicated
that it removed this requirement because it believes that the requirement that a determination be made by a vote presumes
that the vote will be a majority of the members of the District Committee or Subcommittee designated by the District
Committee. File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;14, Amendment No. 3.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Section 15A(b)(8) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15A(b)(8) requires, in part, that the rules of the NASD be designed to provide a fair procedure concerning
the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD.

This rule change clarifies the NASD's membership application process by eliminating the inconsistencies between
the NASD's by-Laws and the Schedules to the By-Laws concerning the administration of this process. In addition, this
rule change clarifies the procedures set forth in the Schedules to the By-Laws for accepting, denying or accepting
with limitations an application for membership.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the rule change is designed to provide a fair
procedure concerning the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD.
The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on May 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to amend Rule 205 (Manner of Executing Odd-Lot Orders) (1) to provide that no differential shall
be charged on odd-lot order transactions (except for non-regular way trades); (2) to revise provisions relating
to the price at which certain odd-lot limit orders shall be executed, and (3) to delete, reposition or re-number various
provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in Section A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 205 relating to the execution of odd-lot orders (1) to eliminate the odd-lot differential
for market and limit orders; (2) amend provisions relating to the price at which odd-lot limit orders are executed;
and (3) delete, reposition or re-number various provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders in Rule 205,
Section B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current Exchange rules, market odd-lot orders to buy or sell, as well as marketable limit orders, are executed
with no differential charged.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell
marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
orders to buy or sell ``at the close''). In order to enhance the competitiveness of Exchange odd-lot execution procedures,
the Exchange has determined to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders (except for non-regular
way executions under proposed Section C(2) of the rule) without a differential.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures for executing odd-lot market orders are currently being implemented on a pilot basis, extended until
August 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 205, Section A(2) would require that limited orders to buy (sell) be executed at the price of the first round lot
transaction which is at or below (above) the specified limit price (the ``effective transaction'' price). Sell limited
orders marked ``short'' would be executed at the price of the first round lot transaction which is at or above the specified
limit and which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick).
Marketable limit orders would continue to be executed in accordance with procedures applicable to market orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
limited orders to buy an offer, sell on bid, ``immediate or cancel''; buy or sell marked ``or on close'') would be deleted.
Provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades in Section C would be deleted and subsumed by new Section
C(2) (Non-Regular Way Trades). A differential could be charged on such executions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities,
and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Washington corporation. On
December 15, 1986, applicant registered under section 8(a) of the Act and filed a registration statement under section
8(b) of the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective and applicant commenced
its initial public offering on May 8, 1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. According to applicant's Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus dated February 16, 1994, in January 1994, First
Albany Asset Management Corporation (``First Albany''), applicant's investment adviser, entered into an asset
purchase agreement (the ``Asset Purchase Agreement'') with Key Trust Company (``Key Trust''). Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, Key Trust would acquire substantially all of the assets of First Albany related to the management
of applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Consummation of the Asset Purchase Agreement was conditioned upon applicant's Board of Directors approving the
plan of reorganization described below. On January 10, 1994, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization
whereby applicant agreed to transfer substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to the Victory
Fund for Income Portfolio (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a newly-created series of The Victory Fund in exchange for shares
of the Acquiring Fund. According to the Combined Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Board of Directors determined
that the facilities and resources of Key Trust would be a benefit to applicant and its shareholders. The Board of Directors
also determined, among other things, that the opportunity to exchange shares of applicant for shares of the other
11 portfolios of the Victory Fund would be an added advantage to applicant's shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proxy materials related to the reorganization were filed wit the SEC and distributed to shareholders on or about
February 28, 1994. On April 22, 1994, holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares of applicant
approved the reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On April 30, 1994, applicant had 4,031,059 shares outstanding and total net assets of $39,440,911 and a net asset
value per share of $9.78.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As of April 30, 1994, applicant transferred substantially all of its assets and certain of it liabilities of the
Acquiring Fund in exchange for full and fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund. Each of applicant's shareholders
received as a liquidating distribution shares of the Acquiring Fund in the same dollar amount as the shares of applicant
held by such shareholder immediately prior to the effective date of the reorganization, plus the right to receive
any unpaid dividends or distributions declared before the effective date of the reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The cost of preparing, filing, and distributing registration and proxy materials necessary to obtain shareholder
approval of the reorganization was borne by the Acquiring Fund's and applicant's managers. No cost of the reorganization
was borne by applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had retained $5,777 in cash to pay its remaining liabilities. Applicant
has no shareholders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently
engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up
of its affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant intends to file Articles of Dissolution under Washington State law.

1. SIT Mutual Funds, Inc., SIT Mutual Funds II, Inc., SIT Growth Fund, Inc., SIT Growth &amp; Income Fund, Inc., SIT
U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc., and SIT Money Market Fund, Inc. (collectively, the ``SIT Group'') are open-end
management investment companies. The SIT Group currently offers eleven series (each a ``Fund''). One of the Funds
is a money market fund subject to the requirements of rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act (together with any future money market
portfolios, the ``Money Market Funds''). The other ten Funds are non-money markets funds (together with any future
non-money market funds, the ``Non-Money Market Funds'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SIT Investment is the investment adviser for the SIT Group. Sit/Kim International Investment Associates, Inc.
serves as sub-adviser for two of the Funds (together with SIT Investment and any future sub-adviser to a Fund, the ``Investment
Advisers.'' SIA Securities Corp. serves as principal underwriter for the Funds. Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. serves
as transfer agent and custodian to the Funds. At the present time, each of the Funds is offered without any sales charge,
redemption fee, or rule 12b&hyph;1 or shareholder servicing fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Money Market Funds seek current income, liquidity, and capital preservation by investing exclusively in short-term
money market instruments, such as U.S. government securities, bank obligations, commercial paper, municipal obligations,
or repurchase agreements secured by government securities. These short-term debt securities are valued at their
amortized cost pursuant to the requirements of rule 2a&hyph;7. The Non-Money Market Funds invest in a variety of debt
and/or equity securities in accordance with their respective investment objectives and policies. Each of the Funds
has, or may be expected to have, uninvested cash in an account with the custodian. This cash either may be invested directly
in individual short-term money market instruments or may not be otherwise invested in any portfolio securities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Applicants seek the ability for (a) the Funds to utilize their cash reserves that have not been invested in portfolio
securities to purchase shares of the Money Market Funds (each Fund, including Money Market Funds, purchasing shares
of the Money Market Funds is an ``Investing Fund'') and (b) the Money Market Funds to sell or redeem their shares to or
from each Investing Fund. By investing cash balances in the Money Market Funds as proposed, applicants believe that
the Investing Fund will be able to combine their cash balances and thereby (a) reduce their transaction costs, since
transaction costs currently incurred by the Investing Funds in connection with the short term investment of their
uninvested cash would be avoided; (b) create more liquidity; (c) enjoy greater returns; and (d) further diversify
their holdings. The policies of the Funds either permit or will be amended (pursuant to shareholder vote if required)
to permit the Funds to purchase money market instruments, including shares of a Money Market Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The shareholders of the Investing Funds would not be subject to the imposition of double management fees. Applicants
would cause each Investment Adviser and its respective affiliates to remit to the respective Investing Funds or waive
investment advisory and any other fees these service providers earn as a result of the Investing Funds' investments
in the Money Market Funds to the extent the fees are based upon the Investing Funds' assets invested in shares of the
Money Market Funds. Further, no sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, 12b&hyph;1 fee, or other underwriting
or distribution fee would be charged by the Money Market Funds with respect to the purchase or redemption of their shares.
If a Money Market Fund offers more than one class of shares, each Investing Fund will invest only in the class with the
lowest expense ratio at the time of the investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several of the Funds have contractual or voluntary expense cap arrangements with SIT Investment for the purpose
of keeping each Fund's total expenses below a certain predetermined percentage amount (``Expense Waiver''). To
the extent actual expenses of the Funds exceed these caps, SIT Investment waives its advisory fee or reimburses a Fund
in the amount of the excess. Any applicable Expense Waiver will not limit the advisory and other fee waiver or remittance
discussed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants also request relief that would permit the Funds to invest uninvested cash in a Money Market Fund in excess
of the percentage limitations set out in section 12(d)(A)(ii) of the Act. Section 12(d)(A)(ii) prohibits a registered
investment company from acquiring the securities of another investment company if, immediately thereafter, the
acquiring company would have more than 5% of its total assets invested in the securities of the selling company. Applicants
propose that each Fund be permitted to invest in shares of a single Money Market Fund so long as each Fund's aggregate
investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater of 5% of such Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million.
Applicants will comply with all other provisions of section 12(d)(1).

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act make it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such affiliated person, acting as principal, to sell or purchase any security to or from
such investment company, Because each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with the other Funds, it may be an
``affiliated person,'' as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the other Funds. Accordingly, the sale of shares
of the Money Market Funds to the Investing Funds, and the redemption of such shares from the Investing Funds, would
be prohibited under section 17(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if the terms of the
proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered
investment company concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general policy of the Act. Section
17(b) could be interpreted to exempt only a single transaction. However, the Commission, under section 6(c) of the
Act, may exempt a series of transactions that otherwise would be prohibited by section 17(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Investing Funds will retain their ability to invest their cash balances directly into money market instruments
if they believe they can obtain a higher return. Each of the Money Market Funds has the right to discontinue selling
shares to any of the Investing Funds if its board of trustees determines that such sales would adversely affect the
portfolio management and operations of such Money Market Fund. Therefore, applicants believe that the proposal
satisfies the standards for relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder prohibit an affiliated person of an investment company,
acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise
or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates. Each Investing Fund, by purchasing shares of
the Money Market Funds; each Investment Adviser of an Investing Fund, by managing the assets of the Investing Funds
invested in the Money Market Funds; and each of the Money Market Funds, by selling shares to the Investing Funds, could
be participants in a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of section 17(d)(1) and rule 17d&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Rule 17d&hyph;1 permits the Commission to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section
17(d). In determining whether to approve a transaction, the Commission is to consider whether the proposed transaction
is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation of
the investment companies is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants. Applicants
believe that the proposal satisfies these standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 12(d)(1), as noted above, sets certain limits on an investment company's ability to invest in the shares
of another investment company. The perceived abuses section 12(d)(1) sought to address include undue influence
by an acquiring fund over the management of an acquired fund, layering of fees, and complex structures. Applicants
believe that none of these concerns are presented by the proposed transactions and that the proposed transactions
meet the section 6(c) standards for relief.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Shares of the Money Market Funds sold to and redeemed from the Investing Funds will not be subject to a sales load,
redemption fee, or distribution fee under a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants will cause the Investment Advisers and their respective affiliates, in their capacities as service
providers for the Money Market Funds, to remit to the respective Investing Fund or waive an amount equal to all fees
received by them or their affiliates under their respective agreements with the Money Market Funds to the extent such
fees are based upon the Investing Fund's assets invested in shares of the Money Market Funds. Any of these fees remitted
or waived will not be subject to recoupment by the Funds' Investment Advisers or their respective affiliates at a later
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For the purpose of determining any amount to be waived and/or expenses to be borne to comply with any Expense Waiver,
the adjusted fees for an Investing Fund (gross fees minus Expense Waiver) will be calculated without reference to
the amounts waived or remitted pursuant to condition 2. Adjusted fees then will be reduced by the amount waived pursuant
to condition 2. If the amount waived pursuant to condition 2 exceeds adjusted fees, the Investing Fund's Investment
Adviser also will reimburse the Investing Fund in an amount equal to such excess.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each of the Investing Funds will be permitted to invest uninvested cash in, and hold shares of, a Money Market Fund
only to the extent that the Investing Fund's aggregate investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater
of 5% of the Investing Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Investing Funds will vote their shares of each of the Money Market Funds in the same proportion as the votes of
all other shareholders in such Money Market Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Investing Funds will receive dividends and bear their proportionate shares of expenses on the same basis as
other shareholders of such Money Market Funds. A separate account will be established in the shareholder records
of each of the Money Market Funds for each of the acquiring Investing Funds.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Sterling Electronics Corporation,
Common Stock, $0.50 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;5522 </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
July 21, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sterling Electronics Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on July 13, 1994
and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for the common stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before August 11, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Watsco, Inc., Common Stock,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Watsco, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on June 16, 1994
and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for the common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before August 11, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) is issuing notice to advise the public it is implementing a new revolving
line of credit loan guaranty program on a national basis to be called the GreenLine Revolving Line of Credit Loan Guaranty
Program (GreenLine). This program authorizes SBA to use its guaranty authority to provide the Agency's full faith
and credit support to loans made by approved lenders that finance the short term, cyclical working capital needs of
small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The establishment of GreenLine is in response to information obtained over a two year period demonstrating the need
for a nationwide revolving line of credit loan guaranty program. Many lenders acknowledged that this type of financing
was generally available in the commercial marketplace to only larger businesses with a need for larger lines of credit.
Small businesses would require the guaranty from SBA in order for lenders to provide them with the same opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GreenLine shall serve as the umbrella for all the Agency's short term lending programs with the exception of the Export
Revolving Line of Credit (ERLC) and the Export Co-Guaranty programs. Under GreenLine, authority to provide a revolving
feature to the Agency's traditional Contract, Seasonal, and Contractors loan programs is added.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The predecessor for this program was tested on a pilot basis in selected local markets beginning on October 1, 1992
when SBA began piloting two revolving line of credit loan programs. Both Programs were designed to assist small business
in obtaining cyclical working capital financing through the authority of SBA's 7(a) guaranty loan program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first pilot, called the Green Line Revolving Line of Credit Program (GRLC), was implemented in the Agency's South
East and South Central Regions, while the second, called the Domestic Revolving Line of Credit Program (DRLC) was
tested in all SBA Regions not served by the Green Line pilot. The predominant distinction between the programs dealt
with the maximum maturity permitted on the loans: GRLC loans had a maturity of up to five years, while the DRLC loans
had a maturity of only one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case files were collected from field offices active in the two pilot programs which were reviewed in order to determine
the creditworthiness of the businesses seeking this financing, as well as to identify various terms and conditions
which would be prudent for inclusion in the new loan program's approval documents. The reviews and program formation
meetings also revealed that the new program would need servicing guidelines designed to provide maximum assurances
that the line would revolve and the losses minimized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since October 1, 1992, 531 loans have been approved under the GRLC pilot for a total of $130.0 million, while for the
same period, 327 loans have been approved under the DRLC pilot for a total of $71.0 million. It is important to note that
this volume of GRLC activity was generated in only two regions, while the DRLC volume was generated in eight. This activity
indicated that a much keener interest exists for the extended terms available under Pilot GRLC than under the Pilot
DRLC Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this program, advances will generally be made against a borrower's certified level of inventory and accounts
receivable, while repayment will be derived from the sale of that inventory and the collection of any resulting accounts
receivable. Participating lenders will be expected to monitor the disbursements of funds from the line and control
the payment of funds back to the line. Primary collateral will consist of a senior lien position on the assets being
financed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA will consider all applications submitted by approved GreenLine lenders which seek up to a 75% SBA guaranty of the
GreenLine financing, not to exceed $750,000. Lender's desiring to participate need to complete a Lender's Qualification
Survey which can be obtained from their local SBA District Office. The processing of GreenLine applications can only
be done by SBA personnel from offices which have completed SBA sponsored training, and received approval from SBA's
Office of Financial Assistance (OFA). Training material has been developed and the training schedule set. Once the
staff in a field office completes the required training, and is designated by OFA, it will be eligible to process GreenLine
applications received from approved participating lenders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All field offices which have processed either GRLC or DRLC loans under the respective regional pilots will continue
to be able to accept and process these loans under their existing pilot guidelines until training has been offered
to their office by the SBA Associate Administrator for Financial Assistance (AA/FA), but in no event later than August
30, 1994. After this date, offices will only be able to accept GreenLine applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Fees Permitted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recognition of the additional servicing and monitoring required to adequately protect the interest of the lender
and SBA, the Agency is temporarily waiving its limitations on service related fees in order to permit the lender to
offset the costs associated with increased servicing required to prudently monitor the lines, and to provide a program
that relates to the lending practices of the private sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of SBA's Regulations presently in effect relative to 7(a) guaranteed business loans (see 13 CFR, paragraphs 120
and 122) will also govern the implementation of GreenLine, provided, however, that the limitation on processing
and servicing fees as found in &sect;&sect;120.104&hyph;2(a)(3) and 120.104&hyph;2(e) of SBA regulations (13
CFR 120.104&hyph;2(a)(3) and 120.104&hyph;2(e)) will be waived for a maximum two year pilot period. Notice of this
pilot is issued pursuant to &sect;120.1&hyph;2 of SBA regulations (13 CFR 120.1&hyph;2). In addition, SBA will ascertain
whether this type of loan can be sold on the secondary market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA will require that participating lenders fully disclose to both the borrower and SBA the fees they intend to charge
the borrower, and that the borrower acknowledge these fees in writing to the lender and SBA prior to the time the guaranty
of the loan is authorized by SBA, and every six months thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA is waiving the fee restriction for GreenLine for up to two years provided the Lender charges their SBA supported
borrowers the same fees and charges for services they would normally charge their non-SBA borrowers with similar
types of revolving lines of credit for similar services.

Outside Servicing Contractors Permitted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GreenLine will require a greater servicing effort by lenders than the Agency's other business loan programs and two
existing pilot programs. SBA recognizes that the extent of these servicing requirements may potentially inhibit
the willingness of small community-based, rural, and independent banks from participating in the program. This
may, in turn, have the undesirable effect of limiting access of creditworthy small businesses to the program in the
areas serviced by such lenders. Therefore, the Agency is authorizing lenders to contract out for the servicing functions
they do not perform themselves. Contracting does not relieve the lender of its responsibilities contained in SBA
Form 750 (or 750 B) or any individual loan authorization issued by SBA. The lenders will be held responsible by SBA for
the activities of their contractors. Every contractor must meet the minimum requirements, as specified below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure that each GreenLine maintains its revolving feature, lenders agree to make initial and periodic examinations
of the borrower's current assets which serve as collateral and forms the basis for disbursements. Lenders also agree
to continually monitor the financial data and control of the cash generated by the borrower as a result of their having
the use of the GreenLine proceeds. At a minimum, a borrower's generated cash must go to an operating account where the
business can not make withdrawals without the concurrence of the Lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the volatility of the collateral securing revolving lines of credit, lenders shall agree as a condition
for approval that they will liquidate a GreenLine borrower's current assets prior to seeking SBA's purchase of any
guaranty.

Minimum Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following standards have been formulated as guidelines for lenders participating in SBA's GreenLine Program
for use when evaluating and selecting an outside or third party service provider (Provider) who may perform those
examination, monitoring, or control functions required to prudently administer GreenLine loans guaranteed by
the SBA: Experience; Competence; Character; Equal Opportunity; Financial Responsibility; Coverage; Business
Authorities; and Confirmation. These standards are numerically arranged from 1 to 8. Those standards noted by an
``a'' after the number are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform examination services. The standards
noted with a ``b'' are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform monitoring or control services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lender shall have the responsibility for providing the required examination, monitoring, or control functions.
Under this program, the lender may contract with a Provider who meets these standards to assist the lender with the
examination, monitoring, or control functions. SBA takes no position on the approvability or quality of any Provider.

STATE&hyph;60, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)) and the Office
of Management and Budget Circular No. A&hyph;130, Appendix I. The Department's report was filed with the Office of
Management and Budget on July 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These systems principally support the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration's role in the processing of
applicants for the U.S. refugee program and the initial reception and placement in the United States of those who are
selected. The Refugee Case Records contain information about applicants for the United States refugee program.
The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program that is
used by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to determine their eligibility for the U.S. refugee program.
The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program which
is used in the initial reception and placement of persons admitted to the U.S. as refugees and to assist in the collection
of refugee travel loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any persons interested in commenting on these proposed systems of records may do so by submitting comments in writing
to Margaret P. Grafeld, Chief, Privacy, Plans, and Appeals Division, Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and
Classification Review, Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520&hyph;1239. These
systems of records will be effective 40 days from the date of publication, (September 6, 1994), unless we receive comments
which will result in a contrary determination. The proposed systems, ``Refugee Case Records, STATE&hyph;59'' and
``The Refugee Data Center Processing Records, STATE&hyph;60'' will read as set forth below.

BACKGROUND: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 24, 1994, representatives of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a new Agreement for
Transitional Arrangements for Air Transport Services. Under provisions of this Agreement, scheduled combination
services are subject to seasonal frequency limitations. For the upcoming winter season, U.S. scheduled combination
carriers may operate a total of 253 weekly round-trip frequencies for U.S.-Germany (third/fourth freedom) services
and 120 weekly round-trip frequencies for Germany-third country (fifth freedom) services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agreement further provides that thirty days prior to each traffic season, each Party shall notify the other Party
through diplomatic channels of the initial allocation of the frequencies among its airlines.

Article 6, Section 1 (A)(1) provides that airlines designated by the United States may operate 106 weekly round-trip
fifth freedom frequencies during the upcoming winter season. Furthermore, under the Section 1 (A)(2), an additional
14 weekly round-trip fifth freedom frequencies are available provided that the United/Lufthansa rights in the London-Germany
market noted in Appendix B to the Agreement have been effectuated. Since United and Lufthansa are operating these
services, the additional 14 frequencies are available to U.S. carriers this winter season.

The U.S. previously was entitled to authorize only one carrier to operate on a third-country code-share basis for
U.S.-Germany services. Northwest Airlines has been designated for this service since November 1993. When Northwest
was last authorized (March 24, 1994) to use the third-country code-share designation, it had requested that its designation
be effective through October 31, 1995. The Department, in extending Northwest's designation through this summer
season (i.e., October 31, 1994), deferred on a decision concerning which carriers would be authorized to use available
rights after November 1, and stated that further procedures regarding these designations would be announced at a
later date.

 Northwest currently has an undocketed application on file for this designation for the period through October 31,
1995. By this notice, however, we are extending the period for which the authorization will be effective pursuant
to the terms within the new Agreement. Therefore, rather than supplementing its previous application, we will require
Northwest to file a new application in the established docket following the requirements set forth in this notice.
Northwest is free to attach and incorporate by reference its previous application for this designation. In addition,
since Northwest is the only carrier that has used the third-country code-share opportunity, we will require that
its application also contain the following information regarding its operations since November 1, 1993: (a) a statement
of number of flights previously allocated, (b) the markets served and frequencies per market and period of operation
for each market and (c) the aircraft types used for each market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 431 in Barbour County, Alabama. The purpose of the proposed
project is to provide a safe, efficient, cost-effective, multi-lane facility, capable of handling existing and
future traffic demands. The EIS will evaluate the realigning of a portion of U.S. 431 to function as a bypass around
the City of Eufaula, Alabama. The proposed project will begin on U.S. Highway 431, south of the City of Eufaula near
Cheneghatchee Creek.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The route will extend to the northeast, passing around the City, and terminating with the intersection of U.S. 431
near Hoboken. The length of the proposal is approximately 6.4 kilometers (4 miles). Alternatives under consideration
include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) taking no action, and (3) postponing the action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in
this proposal. A public involvement meeting and a public hearing will be held in the City of Eufaula. Public notice
will be given of the time and the place of the meeting and hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time.

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 80 in Lee, Macon, and Russell Counties, Alabama. The proposed
project begins at Interstate Highway 85 (I&hyph;85) and extends to the east for approximately 58 kilometers (36 miles).
The proposal would serve as the primary connecting route between the Phenix City metropolitan area and the Interstate
highway system. It is anticipated that improvements will generally be made along the existing alignment of U.S. 80.
The improvements to the travel corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic
demand. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) improving the existing roadway,
(3) taking no action, and (4) postponing the action.

Notice of Request for Secretarial Directive to the Department of Agriculture Concerning the Ocean Transportation
of Title II Preference Cargoes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated July 1, 1994, and accompanying brief, Waterman Steamship Corporation (Waterman) requests that the
Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) require the Department of Agriculture (Agriculture) to comply with the
Maritime Administration's June 16, 1986, Prioritization letter; require the allocation of preference cargoes
by destination; and require the elimination of bidding procedures which compel U.S.-flag dry cargo liner vessels
to bid against foreign competitors and/or non-liner U.S.-flag vessels for the carriage of preference cargoes generated
by the Pub. L. 480 program, 7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., Title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act
of 1954, (Pub. L. 480). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterman alleges that Agriculture is improperly administering its cargo preference program in three critically
important respects, thereby impeding Waterman's participation in the cargo preference program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the Maritime Administration's ``prioritization rule'' issued
June 16, 1986, in that Agriculture is allocating preference cargo to ports where all U.S.-flag service is not available
and is then fixing the cargo on mixed service,

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The Customs
modernization portion of this Act (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057, codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301
note), popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. In order
to share ``straw man'' implementation proposals specific to carrier manifest requirements and entry and clearance
procedures, remote filing, and general order procedures, and to invite informal dialogue relative to implementation
plans and issues, the Office of Inspection and Control conducted a series of public meetings throughout the country.
These meetings were announced in other

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 15498, dated April 1, 1994, and 59 FR 27306, dated May 26, 1994. Comments and suggestions received on the ``straw
man'' proposals have been reviewed, analyzed, and, in some cases, incorporated into the revised proposals that will
be presented at a final public meeting scheduled to be held on August 26, 1994, in Washington, DC, at the Renaissance
Hotel, located at 999 9th Street, NW., from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting will begin with a general briefing covering the Office of Inspection and Control's progress to date, including
a review of the discussions from previous public meetings and future plans to implement ``Mod Act'' provisions. Following
this general briefing, staff members from the Office of Inspection and Control will present revised proposals concerning
vessels, air, truck and rail, general orders, and remote entry filing (for release purposes). Among the topics to
be discussed at this session will be: carrier manifest requirements, electronic transmission of data, carrier entry
and clearance procedures, and carrier liability issues. Presentations on the status of the In-bond Task Force and
the Automated Export System Development Team will be provided by members of those teams. Participants will be given
ample opportunity to ask questions and provide suggestions. In addition, the Director of the ``Mod Act'' Task Force
will report on the present status of implementing provisions of the ``Mod Act.''
