SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214ST
helicopters, that requires creation of a component history card and establishes an additional retirement life for
the main rotor mast (mast). This amendment is prompted by fatigue analysis and retesting that showed that the mast
is sensitive to frequent takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) in addition to time-in-service. The
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the mast, loss of the main rotor system, and
subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214ST helicopters was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59967). That action proposed to require creation of a component historical service record
and proposed to establish an additional retirement life of 50,000 high-power events for the main rotor mast (mast),
part number (P/N) 214&hyph;040&hyph;090&hyph;109. Currently, the mast has a retirement life of 10,000 hours' time-in-service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with some editorial changes. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the notice, the cost estimates associated with this AD were based on replacement of the mast and creation of the component
history card for the entire fleet. This rule contains cost estimates for one-sixth of the fleet each year instead of
the entire fleet, as in the notice. Additionally, the notice referred to the component history card as a ``historical
service record or component history card''. This rule refers to it as a ``component history card or an equivalent record.''
Also, paragraph (d) of this rule was expanded to specify the details of the new retirement life. These changes will
not increase the scope of the AD. However, the FAA has performed a more detailed cost analysis and has determined that,
when factoring in the creation and maintenance of the component history card or equivalent record, the anticipated
costs are $9,163 higher than the proposed amount for the first year, and $7,879 higher than the proposed amount for
each subsequent year. In the proposal, the cost of this AD was estimated to be $53,970 each year ($323,820 for the total
fleet). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 14 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that (1) it will take approximately
24 work hours per helicopter to replace the affected part due to the new method of determining the retirement life required
by this AD, (2) it will take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to create the component history card or equivalent
record (record), (3) it will take approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to maintain the record each year, and
(4) the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $21,810 per helicopter. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators for the first year is estimated to be $63,133, and
each subsequent year to be $61,849. These costs assume replacement of the mast in one-sixth of the fleet each year,
creation and maintenance of the records for all the fleet the first year, and creation of one-sixth of the records and
maintenance of the records for all the fleet each subsequent year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent fatigue failure of the mast, loss of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter,
accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 10 calendar days after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Create a component history card or an equivalent record for the affected mast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine and record the total time-in-service (TIS) accumulated for the mast as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the TIS of the mast is unknown, use a TIS of 900 hours' per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the TIS is known, use that total TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determine and record the accumulated takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) for the mast as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance
with paragraph (a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as total accumulated high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After compliance with paragraph (a) of this AD, continue to record the TIS and high-power events and add the high-power
events to the previously recorded sum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Remove the mast from further service in accordance with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For each mast with 9,900 hours' or more total TIS on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast within
the next 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each mast with less than 9,900 hours' total TIS on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast before
it attains 10,000 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For each mast with 48,900 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast
on or before the accumulation of an additional 1,100 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For each mast with less than 48,900 high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast
before it attains 50,000 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This AD revises the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing a new retirement
life for the mast of 10,000 hours' TIS, or 50,000 high-power events, whichever occurs first. However, for masts with
9,900 hours' or more TIS or 48,900 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, those masts need not be
retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 100 hours' TIS or 1,100 high-power events, respectively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment
and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71 to establish Class
D and Class E4 airspace at the Athens/Ben Epps airport Athens, Georgia. This proposal also would amend the Class E2
surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport to indicate part-time. The establishment of this Class D airspace area
will require pilots, prior to entering the airspace, to establish two-way radio communications with the newly commissioned
air traffic control tower providing air traffic services. (59 FR 22567). Interested parties were invited to participate
in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to
the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Designations for Class D, Class E2, and Class E4 airspace respectively are published in Paragraphs
5000, 6002, and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993. The Class D and Class
E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace areas at Athens/Ben
Epps Airport, Athens, Georgia. This amendment also amends Class E2 surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport,
Athens, Georgia, to indicate part-time. The establishment of this Class D airspace area will require pilots, prior
to entering the airspace, to establish two-way radio communications with the newly commissioned air traffic control
tower providing air traffic service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Labor Relations Board is amending the current administrative regulations governing the standards
of conduct and financial disclosure requirements of employees of the Agency. Most of these regulations have been
superseded by the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch issued by the Office of Government
Ethics (OGE). The NLRB publishes this rule to repeal the superseded provisions and to update cross-references in
the current regulations that continue to be applicable, in conformance with the executive branch-wide standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, NLRB is not repealing the provisions of the existing administrative regulations requiring approval to engage
in outside employment, the prohibition to engage in private practice of law except in family or civic matters, and
the requirement to cooperate with the NLRB's Office of Inspector General in audits and investigations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1967, the NLRB issued 29 CFR Part 100, administrative regulations governing employee responsibilities and conduct
(32 FR 13560), primarily pursuant to and in conformance with E.O. 11222 (May 8, 1965) and regulations issued by the
U.S. Civil Service Commission (5 CFR 735.104, 33 FR 12487). Executive Order 12674 (April 12, 1990)_as modified by
E.O. 12731 (October 17, 1990)_revoked E.O. 11222 and directed OGE to ``establish a single, comprehensive, and clear
set of executive-branch standards of conduct that shall be objective, reasonable, and enforceable.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 7, 1992, OGE published new Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (57 FR 35006).
These uniform standards of conduct, codified at 5 CFR part 2635, became effective on February 3, 1993; and supersede
most of the provisions in the NLRB's regulations found in 29 CFR Part 100. Additionally, the new standard authorized
executive-branch agencies, with the concurrence of OGE, to issue supplemental agency-specific regulations that
are necessary and appropriate to implement their respective ethics programs (5 CFR 2635.105).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NLRB is amending Part 100 by removing/repealing certain sections of subparts A, B, and C that have been
superseded by the new OGE regulations and by revising or redesignating the remaining provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In subpart A, ``Employee Responsibilities and Conduct,'' &sect;100.101 has been amended to cross-reference the
new executive branch-wide standards. Section 100.102 has been revised to accommodate redesignated &sect;100.113.
Sections 100.103 through 100.105, &sect;&sect;100.111 through 100.112, paragraphs (a)(2) through (d) of &sect;100.113,
&sect;&sect;100.114 through 100.122 have been removed. Section 100.123 is redesignated as &sect;100.201 of the
renamed subpart B, ``Cooperation in Audits and Investigations.'' Sections 100.301 through 100.305 and &sect;100.307
of subpart C, ``Special Government Employee Conduct and Responsibility,'' were also superseded as of February 3,
1993, and have been removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 100.106, with a revised paragraph (a) to show the new street address ``1099 Fourteenth Street, NW'' of the
NLRB headquarters, is redesignated as &sect;100.401 of the renamed subpart D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a)(1) and (e) of &sect;100.113 have been redesignated as paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;100.102. NLRB
is not removing these paragraphs, because they contain the Agency's requirements for approval to engage in outside
employment and activities, and the prohibition to engage in private practice of law except in family or civic matters.
Pursuant to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, these requirements will remain
in effect until February 4, 1995, or until NLRB publishes new requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective October 5, 1992, OGE regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, ``Financial Disclosure, Qualified Trusts,
and Certificates of Divestiture for Executive Branch Employees,'' superseded the executive branch confidential
reporting regulations at 5 CFR part 735, subpart D and &sect;735.106, as well as the NLRB's implementing regulations.
Therefore, the NLRB is further amending part 100 by removing &sect;&sect;100.201 through 100.209, along with the
heading of subpart B,'' Employee Statements of Employment and Financial Interest.'' Section 100.306 and the heading
of subpart C, ``Special Government Employee Conduct and Responsibilities,'' and also removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 100.120 (gambling, betting, and lotteries) and 100.121 (general conduct prejudicial to the Government)
of the NLRB regulations are not superseded by 5 CFR part 2635 nor any other OGE regulation. However, pursuant to E.O.
12674 (as modified by E.O. 12731), OPM issued a final rule on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56433) to complement 5 CFR part
2635. Enforceable by the employing agency, this OPM rule_which revised part 735 of title 5, Ch. I of the Code of Federal
Regulations_became effective on February 3, 1993; and established executive branch-wide standards in these conduct
areas. Accordingly, the NLRB is removing &sect;&sect;100.120 and 100.121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, subpart D, ``Employee Personal Loss Claims [Reserved],'' is redesignated as subpart C; subpart E,
``Claims Under the Federal Tort Claims Act,'' is redesigned as subpart D; and subpart F, ``Enforcement of Nondiscrimination
on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Conducted by the National Labor Relations Board,'' is redesignated
as subpart E of part 100 of title 29, Ch. I of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 100.570 is amended to show the new
street address ``1099 Fourteenth Street, NW'' of the NLRB headquarters and the Director of Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule relates to Agency management and personnel. As such, no notice of proposed rulemaking has been published.
For the same reason, the rule is not subject to the review requirements of E.O. 12991.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service is amending its Privacy Act regulations to incorporate changes made by the Computer Matching and
Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;503). That Act amended the Privacy Act of 1974 to establish procedures
affecting agencies' use of Privacy Act records in performing certain types of computerized matching programs. The
rules follow the guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget (54 FR 25818, June 19, 1989). Because the
proposed rule (59 FR 30739, June 15, 1994) generated no comments, the final rule is published unchanged.

The Data Integrity Board oversees Postal Service computer matching activities. Its principal function is to review,
approve, and maintain all written agreements for use of Postal Service records in matching programs to ensure compliance
with the Privacy Act and all relevant statutes, regulations, and guidelines. In addition, the Board annually reviews
matching programs and other matching activities in which the Postal Service has participated during the preceding
year to determine compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and agreements; compiles a biennial matching report
of matching activities; and performs review and advisement functions relating to records accuracy, recordkeeping
and disposal practices, and other computer matching activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any agency or Postal Service component that wishes to use records from a Postal Service automated system of records
in a computerized comparison with other postal or non-postal records must submit its proposal to the USPS Records
Officer. Computer matching programs as defined in paragraph (c) of &sect;262.5 must be conducted in accordance with
the Privacy Act, implementing guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget and these regulations. Records
may not be exchanged for a matching program until all procedural requirements of the Act and these regulations have
been met. Other matching activities must be conducted in accordance with the Privacy Act and with the approval of the
Records Officer. See paragraph (b)(6) of &sect;266.4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agreements must specify: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The purpose and legal authority for conducting the matching program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The justification for the program and the anticipated results, including, when appropriate, a specific estimate
of any savings in terms of expected costs and benefits, in sufficient detail for the Data Integrity Board to make an

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A description of the records that are to be matched, including the data elements to be used, the number of records,

(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the Postal Service may participate in a computer matching program or other computer matching activity that
involves both USPS and non-USPS records, the Data Integrity Board must have evaluated the proposed match and approved
the terms of the matching agreement. To be effective, the matching agreement must receive approval by each member
of the Board. Votes are collected by the USPS Records Officer. Agreements are signed on behalf of the Board by the Chairman.
If a matching agreement is disapproved by the Board, any party may appeal the disapproval in writing to the Director,
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503&hyph;0001, within 30 days following the Board's written disapproval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective dates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No matching agreement is effective until 40 days after the date on which a copy is sent to Congress. The agreement remains
in effect only as long as necessary to accomplish the specific matching purpose, but no longer than 18 months, at which
time the agreement expires unless extended. The Data Integrity Board may extend an agreement for one additional year,
without further review, if within 3 months prior to expiration of the 18-month period it finds that the matching program
is to be conducted without change, and each party to the agreement certifies that the program has been conducted in
compliance with the matching agreement. Renewal of a continuing matching program that has run for the full 30-month
period requires a new agreement that has received Data Integrity Board approval.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This
revision establishes and requires the implementation of an oxygenated gasoline program in the Pennsylvania portion
of the Philadelphia Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). This SIP revision was submitted to satisfy
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) which requires all carbon monoxide nonattainment areas with a design
value of 9.5 part per million (ppm) or greater based generally on 1988 and 1989 air quality monitoring data to implement
an oxygenated gasoline program. The intended effect of this action is to approve the oxygenated gasoline program.
This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62563), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The NPR proposed approval of an oxygenated gasoline program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania on November 12, 1992. The revision included revisions to 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions,
section 121.1 Definitions, and the additions of section 126.1 Oxygenate Content of Gasoline to 25 PA Code Chapter
126, Standards for Motor Fuels. These regulatory revisions were adopted by the Commonwealth on June 16, 1992 and became
effective on August 29, 1992. On February 16, 1993, an amendment to the November 12, 1992 SIP revision was officially
submitted to EPA. The amendment corrected a typographical error in 25 PA Code Chapter 121, section 121.1 in the definition
of ``oxygenated gasoline''. The corrected version of the definition was effective on October 24, 1992. A more detailed
analysis of the state submittal was prepared as part of the NPR action and is contained in a Technical Support Document
(TSD) dated June 15, 1993, which is available from the Region III office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public comments were received from one group on the NPR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) submitted comments on December 29, 1993 which related
to the attest engagement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 requirements. A copy of the AICPA's comments can be found in the Pennsylvania oxygenated gasoline program SIP docket
file which is available from the Region III office listed in the

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Attestation engagements are performed by a certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants.
Attestation engagements are a review of the regulated parties records to assure accuracy. It serves as a means of improving
compliance with the oxygenated gasoline program by identifying problem areas to the regulated parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AICPA had four comments on the NPR which are summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Pennsylvania regulations require the attest engagement report to be submitted within 60 days following the
end of the control period and AICPA suggested that the filing deadline be extended to 120 days to be consistent with
EPA guidelines; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Pennsylvania regulations require attest engagements for both averaging and per gallon information, AICPA believes
this is inconsistent with EPA guidelines;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) AICPA believes that Pennsylvania's implementation guidelines requirement that Certified Public Accountants
(CPA) meet the general standards prescribed in ``Government Auditing Standards, 1988 Revision, published by the
Comptroller General of the United States' General Accounting Office'' (GAS) should be deleted. AICPA commented
that the standards that govern the conduct of the attest engagement are the AICPA Statement of Standards for Attestation
Engagements (SSAE) and not the GAS; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The third column of the EPA NPR, page 62564, contained an error by using the word ``account'' in connection with
``CPA'' and the word should be changed to ``accountant''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed AICPA's comments and determined that the State requirements discussed in the first two comments
are more stringent than EPA guidelines and can be required at the State's discretion, and therefore do not affect the
approvability of this revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third comment deals with the Pennsylvania's implementation guidelines which were not submitted as part of the
SIP revision and therefore the comment is not relevant to the approvability of this revision. However, EPA has contacted
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) concerning this comment. PADER informed EPA that
the section of the Pennsylvania implementation guidelines entitled ``Auditor Qualifications'' requires each
auditor, who performs an attest engagement, to fulfill specific qualifications. One of the qualifications is that
the auditor meet the general standards prescribed in the ``Government Auditing Standards, 1988 Revision, published
by the Comptroller General of the United States' General Accounting Office'' (GAS). The subsequent section of the
Pennsylvania implementation guideline, entitled ``Agreed-upon Procedures'', does require that the auditor comply
with the AICPA Statement of Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) when performing the attest engagement.
This section of the Pennsylvania implementation guideline, entitled ``Agreed-upon Procedures'', addresses the
third comment raised by the AICPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the last comment, EPA acknowledges that it made a typographical error in the NPR, page 62564, and agrees
that the word ``account'' should have read ``accountant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other specific requirements of the oxygenated gasoline program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained
in the NPR and will not be restated here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the amendments to 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions, section 121.1 Definitions, the addition
of section 126.1 Oxygenate Content of Gasoline to 25 PA Code Chapter 126, Standards for Motor Fuels, and the correction
in 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions, section 121.1 in the definition of ``oxygenated gasoline.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by (Insert date 60 days from date of publication). Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action approving Pennsylvania's oxygenated gasoline regulation
may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Memorandum Opinion and Order states the Commission's intention to use lotteries to award licenses for all cellular
unserved areas in which applications were filed prior to July 26, 1993. This action is taken because the Commission
indicated in a prior order in this proceeding that it would address in a separate action the applicability of competitive
bidding or lottery procedures to certain radio applications filed before July 26, 1993. The Commission concludes
that this action to use random selection instead of competitive bidding to award licenses among these competing applications
will serve the public interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this Order, the Commission states its intention to use existing random selection procedures to choose from among
mutually exclusive applications filed prior to July 26, 1993, for authorization to provide cellular service to unserved
areas. This action is consistent with the Special Rule adopted in Section 6002(e) of the Budget Act. In the near future,
the Commission's staff will issue a Public Notice rescheduling the two previously scheduled lotteries. Finally,
the Commission stated that it will consider requests for approval of full market settlements and proceed with licensing
where such approval is granted.

 to establish a more appropriate test procedure for pedestal seats. Manufacturers of most pedestal seats will have
a choice between the current test procedure or the new test procedure. The current test procedure applies a single
load through the center of gravity (cg) of the entire seat. The new test procedure applies two separate loads, one through
the cg of the portion of the seat above the adjuster and the other through the cg of the pedestal. This rule is a response
to manufacturer concerns that the current Standard No. 207 test procedure imposes excessive loads on the adjuster
for pedestal seats when the cg of the seat is located above the seat adjuster. (The adjuster is typically located between
the pedestal and the seat.) Manufacturers believed that the current test procedure is inappropriate for seats whose
cg is located above the adjuster because a portion of the load applied to the seat, and therefore imposed on the adjuster,
represents the weight of the pedestal. In a real crash, only the weight of the seat that is above the adjuster would be
imposed on the adjuster.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 14, 1990, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend Standard 207, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Seating Systems,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 establish a more appropriate test procedure for pedestal seats (55 FR 33141). Under the proposed test procedure,
the pedestal and the seat portion of a pedestal seat would each be separately, but simultaneously, loaded. The NPRM
proposed definitions for a ``pedestal seat,'' and parts thereof, to differentiate such seats from other seating
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
March 8, 1993, NHTSA published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) for the same rulemaking (58 FR
12921). The SNPRM and the 1990 NPRM differed in two principal respects. The first concerned the definition of ``pedestal
seat.'' Instead of attempting to define and differentiate different parts of a pedestal seat from one another, as
was done in the NPRM, the SNPRM simply divided pedestal seats into two portions, that above the adjuster and that below
the adjuster. The second difference concerned whether the new test procedure would replace the current procedure
or become an alternative to it. The new test procedure proposed in the SNPRM was virtually identical to that proposed
in the NPRM, except that the SNPRM gave manufacturers the option of using either the current single load procedure
or the new dual load test procedure for testing most pedestal seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received six comments concerning the March 1993 SNPRM. In general, the commenters supported the SNPRM.
All of the comments were considered when formulating this final rule, and the most significant comments are addressed
below.

Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SNPRM proposed a new definition for ``seat adjuster'' as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Seat adjuster
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means the part of the seat that allows the seat bench and back to move forward and rearward, and/or to rotate around
a vertical axis, including any fixed portion, such as a seat track. The term also means the uppermost seat adjuster
in the case of a seat equipped with seat adjusters at different levels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AM General Corp. (AM General), Chrysler Corp. (Chrysler), and Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corp. (Volvo) commented on the
proposed definition. AM General and Chrysler commented that the proposed definition excluded nonadjustable pedestal
seats and asked that the proposed test procedure also apply to that type of seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with AM General and Chrysler that the amendments proposed in the SNPRM apply only to adjustable pedestal
seats. The focus of this rulemaking has always been manufacturer concerns that the current Standard No. 207 test procedure
imposes excessive loads placed on the adjusters for pedestal seats. The current test procedure requires a single
load to be applied through the center of gravity (cg) of the entire seat. If the cg of a pedestal seat lies at or above the
adjuster, the test procedure places the load of the entire seat, including the pedestal, on the adjuster. However,
in a real-world crash, the adjuster would not have loads imposed on it from the pedestal. NHTSA does not believe the
same concerns apply to non-adjustable pedestal seats. In addition, NHTSA notes that extending this rule to non-adjustable
pedestal seats would be outside the scope of notice of this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Volvo stated that the:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(s)uspension seats in heavy trucks also include a fore and aft slide device which allows the seat to ``float'' and absorb
the pitch moment generated by rough roads or uneven loading. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volvo asked that the definition be changed to clarify that the adjuster is the part of the seat that provides forward
and rearward positioning of the seat, rather than a part of the seat which allows the seat to move while the vehicle is
in motion. NHTSA agrees that the Volvo change clarifies the definition and has adopted the change as suggested.

Adjustment Position (S5.1.1(a)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The test procedure proposed in the SNPRM specified that, if the height of the seat were adjustable, the loads were to
be applied when the seat was in its highest adjustment position. Volvo stated that, since the seat belts of many heavy
trucks are mounted on the seat, the compliance tests for Standard No. 207 and Standard No. 210, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, are regularly conducted simultaneously. Volvo stated that the requirement that the seat be adjusted to its highest
adjustment position conflicted with Standard No. 210, which
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
requires some loading conditions to be applied with the seat in the rearmost position and some of the belt anchors in
the midpoint of any adjustment range. The Administration has previously interpreted NHTSA TP 210 for suspension
seats to be in the vertical mid ride position.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA), stated that the Standard No. 207 ``test procedures have long
stated that such a seat is to be tested at its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
midpoint
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 adjustment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the current Standard No. 207 nor Standard No. 210 have height adjustment requirements for testing adjustable
seats. However, the current version of the Laboratory Test Procedure for Standard No. 207 specifies the highest point
adjustment (P. 25, Figure 6, ``Forward and Aft Loads on Seat Frame with Seat Belts Attached to Seat,'' TP&hyph;207&hyph;09,
January 18, 1992.) NHTSA would like to emphasize that the Laboratory Test Procedures are provided to contracted laboratories
as guidelines for conducting compliance tests, and do not limit the requirements of the applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards. Since Standard No. 207 does not limit the adjustment position, the seat is required to meet
the current requirement in all adjustment positions, and the fact that a test procedure specifies a specific adjustment
position does not limit this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section S4.3.2 of Standard No. 210 specifies that the seat is to be adjusted ``to its full rearward and downward position
*&blank;*&blank;*'' However, this section is related to the seat belt angle location requirements, and does not
necessarily apply to load testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the commenters offered a convincing argument as to why NHTSA should not specify the adjustment position. Since
NHTSA believes that having to meet Standard No. 207 in the proposed highest adjustment position would necessitate
designing a stronger, safer seat than having to meet the standard in another adjustment position, NHTSA has retained
the procedure as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Horizontal Plane (S5.1.1(a)(1)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chrysler commented that the language of S5.1.1(a)(1), ``*&blank;*&blank;* horizontal plane tangent to the lowest
surface of the seat adjuster *&blank;*&blank;*,'' did not reflect some of the seat adjuster designs on its vehicles.
Chrysler stated that the lowest mounting surface on some designs did not lie in a horizontal plane, and the forward/rearward
motion of some designs was not linear. For this reason, Chrysler suggested that the word ``horizontal'' be deleted
from this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with Chrysler it is not possible to specify the horizontal plane tangent to the lowest surface of the seat
as the tangent to the lowest surface of some seat adjusters will not be horizontal. The purpose of S5.1.1(a)(1) is to
define whether the load is in (or above) any part of the seat adjuster, which will allow manufacturers the option of
using either test procedure. Since the applied test load is horizontal and the tangent plane to the lowest surface
of the adjuster may not be horizontal for all possible cases, the word ``tangent'' is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, NHTSA is amending Standard No. 207 because the application of a single load imposes an unnatural
load on the seat adjuster if the cg is at or above the adjuster. Therefore, NHTSA is amending S5.1.1(a)(1) to allow manufacturers
the option of applying either one or two loads whenever the horizontal plane containing the cg either contacts any
portion of the seat adjuster or is above the seat adjuster. Section S5.1.1(a)(3) has also changed to reflect the change
in S5.1.1(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Not Physically Possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to allow manufacturers a choice between the current test procedure and the new test procedure whenever
the cg of the seat was above the adjuster unless it was ``not physically possible'' to use the dual load test procedure.
Volvo objected to the language in proposed S5.1.1(a)(2) requiring manufacturers to use the single load test procedure
when it is ``not physically possible'' to use the dual load test procedure since this limited a manufacturer's choice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the testing done by the agency, the pedestal must be approximately 4 inches high for it to be physically possible
to use the test device. Since the agency no longer defines a pedestal seat in relation to the height of the pedestal,
NHTSA believes that this limitation is necessary. If NHTSA did not include this limitation, the agency might be precluded
from conducting a compliance test in the case of a pedestal seat whose pedestal is too short to accommodate the test
device.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Specification of Dual Load Procedure for Some Pedestal Seats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SNPRM proposed S5.1.1(a)(3) specified the use of the new dual load test procedure whenever the cg of the seat ``is
located below the horizontal plane tangent to the lowest surface of the seat adjuster.'' Ford Motor Co. (Ford) stated
that it believed that this section should specify the use of the single load test procedure instead of the dual load
test procedure. It provided no explanation for its belief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford's suggestion is inappropriate. Specifying the use of the dual load test procedure when the cg is below the seat
adjuster ensures that test loads will be applied to both the pedestal and the seat. If a single load were applied, only
the strength of the attachment of the pedestal to the vehicle, and not the strength of the attachment of the seat to the
pedestal, would be tested.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Clarification of S5.1.1(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has made various minor changes to S5.1.1(a) for the purpose of clarifying and simplifying the language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SNPRM proposed that the effective date for the option to use either the single or dual load test procedure be 90 days
after publication of the final rule. RVIA urged NHTSA to adopt an effective date at least one year following publication
of the final rule. RVIA stated that the proposed effective date ``does not provide sufficient lead time for manufacturers
to deplete existing stock, conduct additional tests under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
either
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 procedure, and make any necessary design or structural modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with RVIA's reasoning. The only type of seat for which modifications might be necessary are seats
whose cg is below their seat adjuster. All other seats either will continue to be required to be certified to the current
test procedure or will have the option of certifying to the current test procedure, and therefore, will not require
modification. NHTSA is not aware of any current seat designs whose cgs are below their adjusters. Therefore, NHTSA
continues to believe the 90 day leadtime is sufficient.

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866 AND DOT REGULATORY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review.'' This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action will have no economic impacts other than a one-time cost related to the test fixture, for those manufacturers
choosing the new procedure. In particular, they would have to add pneumatic or hydraulic rams to their test set-up.
It is estimated that there would be a one-time set-up cost of $2,500. The test procedure would not require any design,
retooling, or assembly changes.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle manufacturers
typically would not qualify as small entities. While some manufacturers of pedestal seats and seat belt attachments
may be small entities, for the reasons stated above, NHTSA believes this final rule would not significantly affect
them. The final rule will not affect the costs of pedestal seats, since the new procedure is optional. Because of this,
small organizations and governmental units that purchase vehicles with pedestal seats should not be affected by
this final rule.

CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

to facilitate the manufacture of ``belt-positioning'' child seats (i.e., booster seats designed to be used with
the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts). The amendment adopts performance and labeling requirements and test criteria
for belt-positioning booster seats that are more appropriate than Standard 213's current criteria for these child
seats. This document also specifies that child booster seats must be labeled as being suitable for children weighing
not less than 30 pounds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule regarding child booster seats responds to the NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (sections 2500&hyph;2509
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (``ISTEA''), Pub. L. 102&hyph;240), which directed the
agency to initiate rulemaking on child booster seat safety and other issues. This rule was preceded by an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22682), and an NPRM published on September 3, 1993 (58
FR 46928). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA directive on booster seats originated in S. 1012, a bill reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation and added verbatim to the Senate's surface transportation bill (S. 1204). The Senate Commerce
Committee report on S. 1012 expressed concern about suggestions that booster seats, ``depending on their design,
can be easily misused or are otherwise harmful,'' and that some child booster seats ``may not restrain adequately
a child in a crash.'' The Committee's concerns grew out of a study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 performed by Calspan Corporation. Calspan found that then-manufactured booster seats could adequately restrain
the 3-year-old (33 pound) test dummy that is used to test the seats for compliance with Standard 213. However, Calspan
also found that when the booster seats were tested with a 9-month-old and a 6-year-old test dummy, the booster seats
could not adequately restrain those dummies. Yet, the booster seats were recommended by their manufacturers as being
suitable for children in the 9-month-old and 6-year-old weight ranges.

``Evaluation of the Performance of Child Restraint Systems'' (DOT HS 807 297, May 1988). NHTSA's follow-up testing
to the Calspan study is discussed in ``Evaluation of Booster Seat Suitability for Children of Different Ages and Comparison
of Standard and Modified SA103C and SA106C Child Dummies,'' VRTC&hyph;89&hyph;0074, February 1990.

The Calspan study indicated that booster seat safety could be improved if booster seats were capable of properly restraining
the wide range of manufacturers' recommended child sizes. Belt-positioning booster seats are capable of accommodating
a wider range of child sizes than currently manufactured shield-type booster seats. Moreover, belt-positioning
seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder belts appear to perform better than shield booster seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder
belts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the ISTEA directive, NHTSA issued two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM's). The first addressed booster
seat performance and labeling requirements; the second, dummies for use in testing booster seats and other child
restraint systems.

b. Booster NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to amend Standard No. 213, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Child Restraint Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to facilitate the manufacture of ``belt-positioning'' child seats (boosters designed to be used with the vehicle's
lap/shoulder belts). The NPRM would add a definition of ``belt-positioning seat'' to the standard, and amend the
definition of ``booster seat'' to include belt-positioning booster seats. Standard 213's compliance test procedures
would be amended to specify that belt-positioning seats are dynamically tested when restrained to the test apparatus
with a lap/shoulder belt. The NPRM described the test apparatus in detail to ensure that the test would be carefully
controlled. NHTSA also proposed to amend labeling and informational requirements to decrease the likelihood that
belt-positioning booster seats would be misused. The agency believed that the proposed performance and labeling
requirements would be more appropriate than Standard 213's current criteria for these boosters.

c. Dummy NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA also issued an NPRM to add additional child compliance test dummies to Standard 213. (59 FR 12225, March 16, 1994.)
The NPRM tentatively selected three new child dummies to add to Standard 213. These dummies are the newborn infant
dummy described in subpart K of 49 CFR part 572 (NHTSA's regulation on anthropomorphic test dummies), the 9-month-old
dummy in subpart J, and the instrumented 6-year-old dummy in subpart I. Subjecting booster seats and other child restraint
systems to more thorough compliance testing with additional dummies better ensures that each child restraint safely
restrains the range of children for whom the restraint is recommended. (Readers should note that, if proposals from
the March 1994 NPRM are adopted, those amendments could modify some of the requirements adopted today, such as the
labeling specified for booster seats.)

The response to the NPRM was very favorable. Commenters included vehicle and child seat manufacturers (Volvo, Ford,
Chrysler and Cosco) and child passenger groups and consultants (Tarrant County Child Car Safety Coalition, Solutions
Unlimited, the University of Michigan-Child Passenger Protection Program (UM&hyph;CPP), Ms. Deborah Davis Stewart,
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety). Commenters also included the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Air Transport
Association and the National Transportation Safety Board. All commenters supported permitting the manufacture
of belt-positioning booster seats. Many suggested changes about specific proposals, and several had suggestions
for or commented on future work on belt-positioning and other booster seats. All comments were fully considered and
the significant ones are addressed below.

e. Overview Comparison of Booster NPRM and Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule adopts most of the proposed amendments, with the following changes. The rule makes minor changes to the definition
of a booster seat for clarification purposes. The rule corrects errors in the specification of the test apparatus
used for belt-positioning booster seats, and does not require metric units on the child seat label.

II. Amendments for Belt-positioning Seats 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To facilitate the manufacture of belt-positioning seats and to distinguish those child seats from other types of
seats for testing and labeling purposes, NHTSA amends Standard 213's definitions in three ways. The first amendment
is to include belt-positioning booster seats in the present definition of ``booster seat.'' NHTSA defines a belt-positioning
seat as a type of booster seat because belt-positioning seats and present booster seats serve similar functions,
i.e., both function to bridge the transition of the child from toddler or convertible child restraints to the vehicle
belt systems. (A convertible restraint is specially adjustable so that it can be used rear-facing by an infant or a
very young child, and forward-facing by a toddler. A ``toddler'' child restraint positions a child forward-facing
only and is not capable of being adjusted to face an infant rearward.) It is also advantageous to place belt-positioning
restraints in the same category as present (shield-type) boosters, because both types of child restraint systems
appear to pose similar potential misuse problems. That is, both could be inappropriately used by children who are
too small to be adequately restrained by a child booster seat. Similar countermeasures, such as labeling and instructional
information, can be developed to address those misuse problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second amendment defines a belt-positioning seat. ``Belt-positioning seat'' is defined as: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A child restraint system that positions a child on a vehicle seat to improve the fit of a vehicle Type II belt system on
the child and that lacks any component, such as a belt system or a structural element, designed to restrain forward
movement of the child's torso in a forward impact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This definition is the same as the one proposed in the NPRM. Commenters were generally supportive of the definition.
Volvo asked for clarification that the definition applies to both add-on and built-in belt-positioning seats. The
definition so applies. Volvo's uncertainty appears to have resulted from several proposed requirements that were
worded in such a way that they were appropriate for add-on seats, but not for built-in ones. (E.g., as proposed, S6.1.2.1.1
stated that a belt-positioning seat ``shall be secured to the standard vehicle seat'' using a lap/shoulder belt.)
NHTSA has reworded those sections to clarify the distinction between add-on and built-in seats to avoid any suggestion
that the definition does not apply to built-in belt-positioning seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third amendment slightly revises the definition of ``booster seat.'' Standard 213 defines a booster seat as ``a
child restraint which consists of only a seating platform that does not extend up to provide a cushion for the child's
back or head.'' (S4 of 49 CFR &sect;571.213) The NPRM would not have changed that definition except to add ``or a belt-positioning
seat'' to the end of it. Ms. Weber of the University of Michigan Child Protection Program (UM-CPP) said that such a change
would be confusing because it implies_contrary to NHTSA's intent_that belt-positioning seats must not have seat
backs. She suggested Standard 213 should better distinguish between the traditional shield-type booster, which
may not have a back, and a belt-positioning booster which may, by naming the former a ``backless child restraint system.''
``This will help clarify the fact that a Belt positioning seat can have a back.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA concurs that naming the backless type of booster seat will help distinguish the two types of child seat. As a result
of today's amendment, ``booster seat'' encompasses two types of restraint system for older children who are still
too small to sit directly on a vehicle seat and use a vehicle belt system. One type is the traditional shield-type booster
used with a Type I belt; the other is the belt-positioning seat used with a Type II belt system. The commenter's suggestion
will help clarify that a belt-positioning seat can have a back, and a child booster other than a belt-positioning seat
cannot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The absence of a seat back for boosters other than belt-positioning seats is one of the main features that distinguishes
a booster seat from a convertible child seat. The distinction is important for Standard 213 testing. The standard
specifies that most restraints are to be anchored with only a lap belt during agency compliance testing. However,
the standard permits a booster seat designed with a top anchorage strap (tether strap) to be tested at 30 mph with the
tether attached. NHTSA permitted attachment of a tether for boosters to facilitate the manufacture of boosters that
provide a harness system, rather than a short shield, for upper torso restraint. Some child safety researchers believed
a harness system was superior to a shield in terms of abdominal loading, head and neck loading, submarining and ejection.
(51 FR 5335.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cosco raised a concern about NHTSA's proposal to simply add ``or a belt-positioning seat'' at the end of the present
``booster seat'' definition. Cosco believed that the change would be inadequate because it would not allow shield-type
boosters to have a seat back. (As explained above, under Standard 213's present definitions, a child restraint cannot
have a seat back and be considered a ``booster seat.'' This restriction is to limit the numbers and types of child restraints
that can be tested in Standard 213's 30-mph dynamic test with their tether attached.) The commenter said that safety
data do not show a need to prohibit seat backs on booster seats. Cosco requested that the definition be reworded either
to allow both types of boosters to use a seat back or to prohibit both from doing so.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA declines to adopt the change requested by Cosco. NHTSA agrees with Cosco that data do not indicate a safety need
to prohibit seat backs on belt-positioning seats. However, the commenter suggests amending the ``booster'' definition
such that a seat back would be an acceptable feature on a shield booster. That suggestion is beyond the scope of the NPRM
and has not been adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In further response to Cosco, the absence or presence of a seat back is the only feature that distinguishes shield-type
boosters from toddler or convertible child restraint systems. Distinguishing booster seats from other child restraint
systems is important because Standard 213 provides that a tether on a booster seat may be tested in the 30 mph dynamic
test, while a tether on a toddler or convertible child restraint system will not be attached. NHTSA does not attach
the tether when testing toddler and convertible restraints because many consumers do not properly attach tethers
on their child seats. Limiting the use of a tether in the test better ensures that child seats perform satisfactorily
as they are typically used in the real world. If boosters were permitted to have seat backs, a new way to distinguish
shield booster seats from other types of child restraint systems would have to be developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative approach to distinguishing between shield booster seats and other child restraint systems could
be to remove the reason for having to distinguish between the restraint systems. That is, NHTSA could amend Standard
213 to specify that all child restraint systems, including shield boosters, would be tested without attaching any
tethers. NHTSA believes all booster seats are currently manufactured without a tether. The agency will consider
for future rulemaking whether Standard 213 should continue to specify attaching tethers on shield boosters in the
standard's 30 mph dynamic test.

b. Test Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Type of Belt System Used To Test Belt-Positioning Seats
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is amending Standard 213's test procedures to specify the testing of belt-positioning seats using a lap/shoulder
belt. Cosco commented that there should be a misuse test in which a belt-positioning booster is tested with a lap belt.
The commenter said research has shown that the HIC and head excursions of dummies in belt-positioning seats tested
with lap belts were much greater than the limits in Standard 213. Conversely, the NTSB stated that, ``Because there
is no information on the extent of booster seat misuse *&blank;*&blank;* it appears premature to require misuse tests.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is not requiring testing belt-positioning seats secured by a lap belt only. Standard 213's approach is to require
child restraint systems to be tested in configurations they were designed for, absent information showing that misuse
of the restraints are resulting in safety problems. The reason for this approach is that child seat manufacturers
must design many safety features into their child restraint systems to protect a restrained child. To do this, the
manufacturers must anticipate how the restraint will be used and design safety into their system bearing in mind their
assumptions about such use. The manufacturer's assumptions about the expected use of the restraint are reflected
in the use instructions to the consumer. Today's rule requires belt-positioning seats to be conspicuously labeled
with instructions about the proper use of the seat, including information on the appropriate vehicle belt system
to be used. Absent information showing a safety need for a belt misuse test, it is premature to require testing belt-positioning
boosters with only a lap belt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Standard Seat Assembly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule adopts test specifications appropriate for testing belt-positioning seats. The agency believes that
the specifications for the testing procedure should be sufficiently detailed so tests conducted uniformly by various
organizations would provide the same results. This presupposes that the test conditions that affect the performance
of the dummy/child restraint should be standardized. Accordingly, NHTSA amends the provisions concerning the standard
seat assembly used to test child restraint systems to depict added anchorages for the shoulder belt system. This rule
specifies a Type II seat belt assembly for use in testing belt-positioning seats. The standard belt system eliminates
the variability of these belt parameters. In response to Ford and UM-CPP, this rule also modifies some of the specifications
proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford and UM-CPP suggested that the rule should specify the type of latch plate, and further suggested ``that a locking
latch plate is appropriate, given the new rule on lap belt lockability.'' NHTSA has specified that retractors and
reels are not used in the standard seat assembly, which is what was proposed in the NPRM. Since retractors and reels
are absent, the latch plate functions as a locking latchplate. The agency agrees with these commenters that this is
appropriate given the FMVSS No. 208 lockability requirements that will be effective on September 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency's lockability final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 13, 1993, ``requires that lap belts or the lap belt portion of lap/shoulder belts be capable of being used
to tightly secure child safety seats, without the necessity of the user's attaching any device to the seat belt webbing,
retractor, or any part of the vehicle in order to achieve that purpose.'' This requirement applies to rear vehicle
seating positions that are recommended, in FMVSS No. 213, as the safest positions for placing a child restraint system.
The latchplate used for Standard 213 testing will be consistent with the lockability requirement, and will reflect
the type and operation of latchplates used in vehicles for attaching child restraint systems.

Ford and UM-CPP said that the buckle assembly length should be specified as measured from the inboard anchor, ``such
that the length exposed beyond the bight is consistent with the maximum allowed by SAE J1819.'' NHTSA agrees that the
length of the belt exposed beyond the bite (i.e., the intersection of the seat back and seat cushion) needs to be specified
and agrees with using the value recommended by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in its draft recommended
practice J1819, ``Securing Child Restraint Systems in Motor Vehicles.'' The J1819 draft recommended practice is
a result of a joint effort of manufacturers of motor vehicles and child restraint systems to promote compatibility
between child restraints and vehicle seats and seat belts. As stated in the draft recommended practice, ``[C]hild
restraint systems and vehicle seats and seat belts having features that conform to this document are more likely to
be compatible with one another.'' By using the J1819 value, the agency not only specifies a uniform standard test procedure
but also reinforces the guidelines that promote the compatibility between child restraints and vehicle seats and
seat belts. Accordingly, NHTSA has revised Figures 1A and 1B and the addendum (addendum A, Seat Base Weldment, dated
July 1, 1993) to the Drawing Package SAS&hyph;100&hyph;1000 to show the length of the buckle assembly. (The materials
have also been revised to round off the dimensions to the whole millimeter.)

Ford suggested that tension in the standard belt be set at the 2 to 4 pound (9 to 18 N) force specified in Standard 208,
rather than the 12 to 15 pound (53 to 67 N) force specified by Standard 213 for securing add-on child seats. Ford said
that the former range is more representative of the tension induced in a typical Type 2 belt by the emergency locking
retractor. NHTSA agrees. This rule adopts the proposed requirement in S6.1.1.3 stating that_

[T]hese seat belt assemblies meet the requirements of Standard No. 209 (&sect;571.209) and have webbing with a width
of not more than 2 inches, and are attached to the anchorage points without the use of retractors or reels of any kind.

However, the agency has replaced S6.1.2.2 with a new section to specify preloading of the various belts. The new section
maintains the current 12 to 15 pounds pretensioning of the lap belt that restrains the add-on child restraint to the
test seat assembly, but specifies that the shoulder portion of the Type 2 belt should be pretensioned to a 2-pound force
as in FMVSS 208.

UM-CPP suggested that the shoulder belt should not be tightened to 12 to 15 lb prior to the test as is currently required
for lap belts. It said that a procedure to determine the tension in the shoulder portion of the belt may be needed. The
commenter suggested that a procedure consisting of placing a curved block with a given radius against the dummy's
chest, tightening the belt to the usual tension, and removing the block before the test, is a repeatable method of introducing
appropriate slack when tightening the belt. NHTSA disagrees that the suggested procedure is necessary. Today's
rule adopts a procedure in S6.1.2.2 which specifies that the tension of the shoulder belt is measured by a load cell
placed on the webbing portion of the belt system prior to the dynamic test. Thus, there is a procedure for ensuring that
the belt has the proper tension. NHTSA believes it is immaterial how the belt is tightened as long as the requisite tensile
force is achieved. Moreover, a procedure for tightening the belts can be addressed in the Laboratory Procedures for
the Standard 213 dynamic test. Describing the procedure in the laboratory procedures is preferable to describing
it in the standard because there might be ways to tighten the belt (e.g., by use of a metallic roller) that might be easier
to use than another procedure (e.g., use of a wooden block), that lead to equally uniform and repetitively consistent
results.

Ford stated that additional specifications for belt elongation are needed for the seat belt assembly to be used in
testing belt-positioning booster seats. Ford said that_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard 209 allows use of webbing having any elongation up to 30 percent in Type 2 belts. Using webbing with 30 percent
elongation for the lap/shoulder belt on the standard test seat may result in quite different results than using webbing
of 7 percent elongation.

It suggested that S6.1.1.3 be amended to include a close tolerance specification for elongation of the standard belt
webbing used in the Standard 213 test for all child restraint systems, based on typical polyester belt webbing, such
as the draft ECE 44 Annex 13 standard seat belt webbing specification of 8

1 percent at 11 kN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA does not believe there is a need to specify the elongation of the webbing material used for testing belt-positioning
seats. Standard 213 does not currently specify the elongation of the webbing used for testing child restraint systems.
Further, NHTSA is unaware of information indicating that elongation should be specified. (Under S4.2(c) of Standard
209, the webbing in a Type I seat belt assembly shall not extend to more than 20 percent elongation at 2,500 pounds.)
There is no apparent reason why elongation should be specified for the Type 2 assemblies used to test belt-positioning
seats, when elongation is not specified for the Type I assemblies used to test all other child restraint systems. Also,
not specifying elongation better ensures the dynamic test is representative of real-world crash conditions. NHTSA
obtains webbing material from seat belt suppliers for use in Standard 213's dynamic test. These suppliers also furnish
vehicle manufacturers with the webbing used in motor vehicles. Under current Standard 213 test procedures, NHTSA
tests child restraint systems using webbing that is typical of that installed in vehicles. Any manufacturer that
is concerned about the possible effect that elongation might have on the performance of the child restraint can identify
and perform a ``worst case.'' A manufacturer may determine that a child restraint meeting Standard 213's performance
criteria when tested under worst case conditions will likely meet those criteria when tested under less severe conditions.
A manufacturer that tests its restraint for certification purposes could limit its testing by deciding to test only
a ``worst case'' scenario, i.e., testing under the most austere or unfavorable conditions and circumstances specified
in the standard.

 Relying on worst case testing as a basis for a manufacturer's certification is commonplace among manufacturers.
For example, Standard 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' requires injury criteria to be met with the test vehicle
traveling forward at any speed ``up to and including 30 mph'' into a fixed barrier ``that is perpendicular to the line
of travel of the vehicle, or at any angle up to 30 degrees in either direction from the perpendicular'' (S5.1). Manufacturers
typically test a vehicle at 30 mph into a perpendicular barrier since that is the worst case test. The manufacturers
believe that if the vehicle passes that worst case test, it is reasonable to conclude it will pass less severe tests
(e.g., at lower speeds into angled barriers).

[D]oes not follow the research results reported in DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808003, TABLE 9, and has an unintended negative
effect on test results. Although the lateral (Y) position relative to the outboard anchor has been used, the X and Z
dimensions of the old center anchors have been retained. This inappropriately low anchor creates an especially long
inboard belt length which, when loaded during the test, makes the booster suddenly shift toward the outboard anchor,
sometimes shoving the dummy's neck into the shoulder belt and sometimes leaving the upper torso lagging behind at
an angle, depending on the initial geometry. This occurs because the effective center of this very asymmetrical belt,
when loaded, is not halfway along the Y axis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Anchorages for the lap portion of the lap/shoulder belt on the standard test seat assembly are highly asymmetric,
with the inboard anchorage about 185 mm lower than and rearward of the outboard anchorage. Such highly asymmetric
anchorages are atypical. The outboard anchorage also appears to be unusually high.

NHTSA agrees with the comments made by Ford and UM. The proposed location for the anchor points was based on the average
location of the anchorage points that was determined by the agency's research. However, among the proposed set of
coordinates for the inboard anchor point, only the y-coordinate was based on the average location. The x- and z-coordinates
of the old anchor were used. NHTSA will define all three coordinates of the inboard anchor point to reflect the location
of the ``average'' condition identified by the NHTSA research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In January 1994, tests were conducted at the agency's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC), to verify that the change
in anchorage point does not negatively affect the quality and consistency of the tests. Those tests were directly
comparable to the tests in the earlier study, DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808003, using the same booster/dummy configuration,
except that the inboard anchorage was at the ``old'' location in the fore-aft and vertical axes. The tests showed that
the corrected anchorage locations had a negligible affect on the performance of the child seats used to restrain 3-
and 6-year-old dummies. That is, there was no marked difference in the performance of the child seats using the old
anchorage locations as compared to the performance of the seats with the corrected locations. The principal difference
observed in the kinematics was that the booster seat did not slide toward the outboard anchorage location when tested
with the corrected inboard anchorage, as it tended to do using the old anchorage. This sliding is attributed to the
asymmetry of the inboard and outboard anchorages when tested with the old anchorage configuration. A report on these
VRTC tests is available in the docket for this rulemaking.

UM&hyph;CPP commented on the issue of the flexibility of the seat assembly's seatback for testing booster seats.
The commenter believes the specified seatback is too flexible to represent real-world vehicle seats, and that the
flexibility unrealistically affects booster test results. In the March 1994 dummy NPRM discussed above, NHTSA announced
that its research has shown that rulemaking does not appear warranted on changing the flexibility of the seatback.
The research evaluated the performance of booster seats when restrained under both conditions of flexible and rigid
seat back test assembly. The research findings indicated that the flexibility of the seatback is not a factor that
affects the test dummy's performance during compliance testing of shield-type booster seats. These findings were
summarized in a report titled, ``Evaluation of Effects of FMVSS 213 Seat Back's Flexibility on Booster Seat Responses,''
October 1992 (VRTC&hyph;82&hyph;0236, ``Child Restraint Testing (Rulemaking Support),'' DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808006.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In commenting on this issue, UM said that the research was too limited. The commenter also did not agree with the conclusion
not to undertake rulemaking:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A very limited investigation of the issue concluded that shield boosters that had passed compliance tests with the
flexible seatback also passed with a rigid seatback. What the report did not acknowledge was the fact that, with the
rigid back, knee excursion increases were significant, and rebound in every case saw the dummy rise well above the
cushion and its head well above the seatback. The VRTC film footage is more dramatic than the still frames in the report,
and it also shows the impacts of the dummy's head with the structure behind the seatback. *&blank;*&blank;* I recommend
that the rigid seatback be adopted now at least for the 3-point belt test procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA does not dispute that the flexibility of the back of the test seat assembly can affect a dummy's performance during
compliance testing of shield-type booster seats. NHTSA also recognizes that there are good reasons to further evaluate
the representativeness of the standard's test buck, concerning current vehicle seats. Moreover, NHTSA believes
there might be other reasons that may justify changing the Standard 213 seat back, such as possible cost reductions
due to not having to change the flexible pin in the seat hinges of the standard seat assembly after each test. The agency
has an on-going feasibility study at VRTC to determine if a need exists to upgrade the current FMVSS 213 test buck with
regard to these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, NHTSA disagrees that the agency's research was too limited. NHTSA evaluated films and test reports for all
(seven) available FMVSS 213 compliance tests on child booster seats that were performed in 1990 and 1991. In addition,
sled tests were conducted on each of the booster seats that showed forward movement and contact with the dummy during
the compliance testing. There were four of these seats. When the seat back was fixed (rigid), the dummy's knee excursion
increased. However, the increased values for knee excursions did 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exceed the 36-inch limit of FMVSS 213. In view of a lack of a safety need to revise the seat back, the agency has decided
to complete the VRTC feasibility study before deciding whether to undertake rulemaking on the matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UM&hyph;CPP is correct that the dummy rose above the seat cushion when tested with the rigid seat back, and did impact
its head on the structure located behind the test assembly. However, that finding is inconclusive because the impacted
structure was placed on the test buck for the research and evaluation program on belt-positioning booster seats,
and will not be part of the seat assembly used in FMVSS 213 compliance testing. Thus, the dummy's head will not impact
the structure in an FMVSS 213 compliance test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Performance Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule adopts performance requirements for belt-positioning seats. This rule requires belt-positioning seats
to meet the structural integrity, excursion, and injury criteria requirements of Standard 213 when dynamically
tested. Those requirements include maintaining the structural integrity of the seat, retaining the head and knees
of the dummy within specified excursion limits (limits on how far those portions of the body may move forward), and
limiting the forces which the head and chest of the dummy may experience during the test. Compliance with these requirements
better ensures that a child using the seat will not be injured by the collapse or disintegration of the seat, or by contact
with the interior of the vehicle, or by experiencing intolerable forces. Commenters overwhelmingly supported dynamically
testing belt-positioning seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not adopt additional performance requirements for belt-positioning seats. The NPRM asked for comments
on the merits of additional performance requirements, and commenters disagreed with each other on the issue. UM&hyph;CPP
and Solutions Unlimited believed that the weight of the booster seat should be limited in order to limit loading the
back of a child occupant. Cosco said that it is unaware of any data that indicate a safety problem with the loads that
could be generated by booster seat backs. Cosco said excessive back loading would result in either higher HIC's or
higher G forces, and possibly greater excursions. The commenter believed it may be unnecessary for the agency to try
to measure seat back loading, unless NHTSA has research showing this phenomenon is of potential concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates also believed that Standard 213's dynamic test would detect problems relating to booster seat backs. The
commenter urged NHTSA to_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Carefully monitor and investigate defect complaints and manufacturer data related to special design features.
These aspects of booster seats can be dealt with through future rulemaking specifically addressing a problem identified
by manufacturer testing and consumer use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has decided not to specify limits on seat back loading at this time. There is a lack of data indicating a safety
problem. Further, there is no procedure at present for measuring or determining a threshold value for the loads imposed.

d. Labeling and Printed Instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule adopts requirements for labeling and printed consumer instructions to decrease the likelihood that belt-positioning
seats will be misused. The information that needs to be conveyed to the consumer is: (a) That a belt-positioning seat
must be used with a vehicle lap/shoulder belt system to perform effectively and must not be used with just a vehicle
lap belt; (b) when using a shield booster with a vehicle's lap/shoulder belt system, the consumer must place the shoulder
belt portion of the system behind the child's head; and (c) the belt-positioning seat is not certified for aircraft
use. Each of these items of information is discussed below. This rule does not adopt the proposal that the manufacturer's
height and weight recommendations on the label include the information in metric units. In commenting on the NPRM,
Tarrant County Child Car Safety Coalition said that the metric units would be extremely confusing to many parents.
Similarly, Ford and Cosco commented that the proposed use of the word ``mass'' in the label would be confusing. NHTSA
concurs that the metric information on the label is unnecessary at this time. (Pursuant to the agency's plan to convert
to the metric system pursuant to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act and E.O. 12770, this rule specifies metric
units in the specifications for Standard 213's compliance test procedures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, figures 1A and 1B. Since these values will not be any part of a labeled child seat, the metric values will not engender
confusion on the part of ordinary consumers.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Appropriate Vehicle Belt System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA adopts a requirement that each add-on and built-in belt-positioning seat be labeled with a warning about using
the seat with Type 1 or the lap portion of Type 2 belt systems in a vehicle. No commenter other than Chrysler disputed
the need for the labeled warning. (Chrysler's comment is discussed below with respect to ``dual purpose'' boosters.)
In response to Cosco's belief that the warning was proposed to be on a separate label, no such requirement was proposed.
The warning can be on the existing installation label. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety believed that there is
need for an installation diagram showing the proper installation of the belt-positioning seat in a vehicle. The American
Academy of Pediatrics believed the installation diagram should be placed directly on the child seat, and not on accompanying
printed material. Child restraints are already required to be labeled with an installation diagram showing the restraint
in the right front seating position in a vehicle, with a lap/shoulder belt (S5.5.2(l)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA proposed a labeling requirement for ``dual purpose'' boosters. These boosters can be used with either a lap
or a lap/shoulder belt in the shield mode, but only with a lap/shoulder belt in the belt-positioning mode. These seats
also typically require different belt routing for the two modes. To better ensure the boosters are properly used,
the agency proposed requiring dual purpose boosters to be labeled with information about the appropriate vehicle
belt system (lap-only or lap/shoulder belt system, depending on the design of the booster) to use with the booster,
and about how the booster must be used with the particular belt system (e.g., with or without the booster's shield).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler believed there is no need to label built-in dual purpose boosters that are factory-installed. Chrysler
believed these seats are already labeled with too much information, and that the information on the proposed label
``will mostly duplicate the information that is already provided in the [vehicle] owner's manual.'' Conversely,
Volvo commented that built-in belt-positioning seats ought to be labeled with information on correct belt usage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with Chrysler. There is a substantial amount of information that must be labeled on built-in seats.
However, it is vitally important that built-in seats be used with the appropriate vehicle belt system. Instructing
consumers how to use the belt-positioning booster increases the likelihood of correct usage. Further, the agency
believes that consumers are more likely to refer to the information if it is ``handy'' on the seat rather than in the
vehicle owner's manual. However, NHTSA is aware of concerns that there is too much information placed on child seat
labels. The agency will evaluate the labeling mandated by Standard 213 in the near future to determine if changes are
warranted.

2. Placement of Shoulder Belt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule requires manufacturers to label shield boosters with a warning to consumers that if the booster is used with
a Type II belt system, the shoulder belt portion of the belt system should be placed behind the child. Comments on the
proposed requirement were divided. UM&hyph;CPP ``strongly support[ed]'' the proposal because it found high head
accelerations resulting from impact of the dummy's head with the dummy's arm. Cosco disagreed with the proposal,
stating that the proposal ``ignores the excellent performance of shield booster seats used with the shoulder belt
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
front
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the child.'' (Emphasis in text.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with Cosco about the effectiveness of shield-type booster seats used with the shoulder belt routed
in front of the child. The agency's VRTC Report No. DOT&hyph;HS&hyph;808&hyph;005 titled, ``Evaluation of Belt
Positioning Booster Seats and Lap/Shoulder Belt Test Procedures,'' summarized the findings of the agency's test
program on different booster seats. The report stated that, for small shield booster seats, ``the routing of the shoulder
belt (three point belt) in front of the dummy did significantly effect the HIC, 3 msec chest clip [acceleration], and
head excursion values, regardless of dummy size.'' Specifically, the study stated that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The 3 year old dummy/three point belt tests had 80% to 90% higher HIC values than the corresponding lap only belt tests,
while for the 6 year old dummy, the three point belt tests were 18% to 59% higher. The 3 year old/three point belt tests
were the only test conditions that produced HIC values above 1000.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study also showed that the chest clip acceleration increased for the 3-year-old dummy tested in two shield booster
seats, from 31G to 44G and from 38G to 45G, respectively. The chest acceleration increases for these seats were from
about 36G to 52G and 28G to 44G respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, NHTSA does not know of any shield-type booster seat that performs well when the booster seat is used with a
lap/shoulder belt system and the shoulder portion of the belt system is left in front of the child.

The Air Transport Association and UM&hyph;CPP supported the proposed requirement but also suggested requiring
all boosters to be so labeled. That suggestion is outside of the scope of the NPRM and has not been adopted. However,
NHTSA and the Federal Aviation Administration are jointly examining this issue and may initiate a separate rulemaking,
if warranted.

ATA was concerned that both the statement against aircraft use and the statement certifying to aircraft use are required
to be in red. ATA suggested that the former statement be in a color other than red, to distinguish it from the latter.
The commenter believed an other-than-red contrasting color will help airline personnel better identify which child
seats are suitable for aircraft.

NHTSA does not agree with the suggestion that there is a need to require the use of an other-than-red contrasting highlight
color to distinguish the warning against aircraft use from the certification to aircraft use. The red color is sufficient
to draw the attention of airline personnel to a warning. NHTSA believes using a color other than red would not necessarily
increase the level of awareness of the message contained in the warning. Rather, a message highlighted in red would
catch the eye of the reader (in this case, airline personnel), who would then read the message. Further, because belt-positioning
boosters lack any component in front of the child, they are readily distinguishable from other types of child restraints
(i.e., child restraints suitable for aircraft). The unique appearance of belt-positioning seats should facilitate
their identification by airline personnel.

This rule adopts a labeling requirement to address the problem of booster seats being used for children too small for
the restraints. This rule requires that, in labeling booster seats with their recommendations for the maximum and
minimum weight and height of children who can safely occupy the seats (S5.5.2(f) and S5.5.5(f)), manufacturers must
not recommend the seat for use by a child whose mass is less than 13.6 kilograms (30 pounds). No specific comments were
received on the feasibility of developing a booster seat that would safely restrain children weighing less than 30
pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the proposal were divided. Supporting the proposal were Volvo, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety,
UM&hyph;CPP, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Advocates believed that if booster seats are permitted
to cover a wide range of body weight and size, they become less appropriate at either end of the weight spectrum of recommended
use. Further, Advocates said ``merely stating a minimum figure of 30 pounds in the manufacturers' recommendations
for the weight and height range of the restraint is not sufficient.'' It said the booster seats should also have a separate
affirmative warning statement that the booster seat is not recommended for children who weigh less than 30 pounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Academy encourages NHTSA to be responsive and supportive of innovations in restraint technology, development
of new products should be guided by a recognition of a child's requirements for protection at different stages of growth.
What would be the low-weight end for such a product? We doubt that it is appropriate to approve a booster seat for children
weighing less than 30 pounds, when these children can be more safely transported in standard car safety seats. Ten
years ago, it was not uncommon for boosters seats to be available for children who weighed 20 pounds. Gradually, the
industry shifted because of concern for protection of the younger children to where the low-weight end for boosters
became 30 pounds. To drop below 30 pounds as the minimum weight for boosters, again, means to consider designs that
provide for upper-trunk support, designs like the early Strolee booster seat that included a five-point harness
and tether. Since it is unlikely that this design would find popular acceptance and use, a more reasonable course might
be to explore the potential of integrated booster seats in motor vehicles for children weighing less than 30 pounds.
To do this, however, requires attention to developing a lap/shoulder belt that can adjust to varying heights so that
the fit is across the child's chest, not the child's face or neck.

Ford and Cosco opposed the proposal. Ford said that the vehicle manufacturer should have the flexibility to recommend
use of a belt-positioning (booster) seat, ``even for some children under 30 pounds.'' Ford said, ``A very thin child
weighing less than 30 pounds may be too tall for a convertible child restraint, but an ideal candidate for a belt-positioning
booster.'' Ford suggested that rather than base the prohibition on weight (30 pounds), NHTSA base it on height or age.
Thus, Ford suggested that Standard 213 specify that no booster can be recommended for children of standing heights
less than 900 mm (36 inches) or less than two years of age. Cosco believed that the prohibition against recommending
a booster for children less than 13.6 kilograms (kg) is design restrictive:

Surely it is possible that a booster seat meeting all requirements *&blank;*&blank;* could be developed either for
children under 30 pounds or over 60 pounds in the future. Requiring a product to meet all the dynamic test requirements
regardless of what weight is recommended should be sufficient.

NHTSA does not agree with Ford and Cosco that Standard 213 need not specify that boosters must not be recommended for
children of less than 13.6 kg. NHTSA generally agrees with Cosco that dynamic test requirements should be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 criteria in determining whether a given design performs adequately. However, in the case of booster seats, the dynamic
test failed to prevent substandard restraining devices, with respect to protecting children at the extremes of the
weight ranges recommended for the restraints (e.g., the 20 pound and the 48 pound child). As explained in the ANPRM
preceding this rule, heretofore, manufacturers had great leeway in manufacturing booster seats and specifying
which size (weight) children were suitable for the seats. That leeway resulted in alarming practices:

Concerns about shield-type boosters arose from the recommendations by manufacturers about the size of children
which could appropriately use a particular booster. Particular designs or models of boosters were typically recommended
for a broad range of children. Often, the seats were recommended for use by children weighing from about 20 to 70 pounds.
Such recommendations engendered concerns as to whether these boosters could provide adequate protection for children
ranging from nine-month-old infants (average weigh 20 pounds) to six-year-old (48 pounds) and older children.

As explained in the ANPRM, in tests conducted by NHTSA and by Calspan Corporation, it was found that shield boosters
could not restrain a test dummy representing a 9-month-old child when dynamically tested using Standard 213's procedures.
Yet, the boosters were certified as meeting Standard 213, because only the three-year-old (33 pound) child dummy
is used to determine compliance with the standard. So tested, the restraints met Standard 213. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with the commenters that children with a mass of less than 13.6 kg are better protected in convertible
and toddler seats. These child seats have been performing well when tested with the various sizes of dummies. However,
booster seats have not performed adequately in restraining dummies with masses of less than 13.6 kg in tests done over
the years at Calspan, the University of Michigan and VRTC. Moreover, the 9-month-old dummy in Part 572 that could be
used to evaluate the effectiveness of booster seats in protecting children with masses less than 13.6 kg is not instrumented,
and is therefore limited in its ability to provide a full and accurate indication of the safety of booster seats in protecting
the very young child. Accordingly, the agency agrees with AAP that the proposed minimum weight limit for use of booster
seats should be imposed until, and if, the state of the art of the technology evolves to design and develop a booster
seat that would protect children with masses of less than 13.6 kg. However, the agency does not agree with Advocates
that an affirmative warning label is appropriate. The label is ladened with warning statements, and adding to the
label risks ``information overload,'' which could reduce the effectiveness of each warning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is effective in 30 days. An effective date of less than 180 days is justified because this rule relieves present
requirements in Standard 213 that restrict the manufacture of belt-positioning booster seats. Moreover, the rule
facilitates the manufacture of a booster seat that could provide safety benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, sections of Standard 213 adopted today that affect present labeling of shield booster seats and the printed
instructions accompanying these seats are effective September 1, 1994. Those sections are S5.5.2(i)(2) and S5.6.1.9(a).
Ford and Cosco pointed out that the NPRM included proposals on those sections that would affect how present booster
seats are labeled, and how printed instructions now read. S5.5.2(i)(2) and S5.6.1.9(a) require that a booster seat
be labeled with and provided with instructions on a warning to use the booster seat only with the vehicle's lap belt
system, or with the shoulder belt portion of a Type II belt behind the child.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ford and Cosco argued for a longer leadtime for these changes. NHTSA agrees that more leadtime is appropriate. The
agency agrees with Cosco that more leadtime will help deplete supplies of existing labels (Cosco suggested three
months is adequate), and concurs with Ford that more leadtime is warranted to change existing labels and printed instructions.
(Ford suggested an effective date of September 1, 1994.) This rule makes the requirements affecting the labeling
and printed instructions for shield boosters effective September 1, 1994.

The commenters were particularly concerned about the proposal that would have required boosters to provide children's
height and weight information in metric units of measurement. This rule does not adopt the proposal for metric units
on the label. Further, while this rule adopts the proposal that child booster seats must not be recommended for children
of masses of less than 13.6 kg (30 pounds), all child booster seats are now not recommended for children of masses less
than 13.6 kg.

With regard to belt-positioning seats, the labeling requirements adopted today do not change the way these child
seats are labeled. Since belt-positioning seats cannot now meet Standard 213, there are no belt-positioning seats
manufactured today for children under 50 pounds. The requirements only apply if manufacturers desire to produce
such seats for children under 50 pounds.

This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered
the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures,

this action which discusses its potential costs, benefits and other impacts. A copy of that evaluation has been placed
in the docket for this rulemaking action. Interested persons may obtain copies of the evaluation by writing to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To briefly summarize the evaluation, while the agency believes that belt-positioning seats will improve safety,
the magnitude of that improvement is not known. Belt-positioning booster seats might be more acceptable to children
than shield-type boosters. This could lead to increased usage rates for child restraint systems. Increased usage
is important because child restraints are highly effective when used properly. Belt-positioning booster seats
raise the child up in the vehicle seat, increasing the chances that the vehicle's shoulder belt would fit properly,
and also that the lap belt will fit properly because it will be positioned lower on the child's hips. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also concludes that this rule will result in negligible costs for testing labs and manufacturers of belt-positioning
booster seats. The costs would result from testing and certifying belt-positioning seats. Manufacturers will be
minimally affected by this rulemaking because it simply permits new designs in booster seats and does not require
any design change or impose additional costs on manufacturers. Manufacturers that do not want to manufacture a belt-positioning
booster seat will not be affected.

NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency knows of 14
manufacturers of child restraints, seven of which NHTSA considers to be small businesses (including Kolcraft, which
with an estimated 500 employees, is on the borderline of being a small business). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the number of small businesses, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities.
The rule would affect manufacturers only if they choose to manufacture a new type of booster seat. The amendment could
benefit manufacturers by allowing them to manufacture and sell a new product. However, the agency does not know how
interested manufacturers are in belt-positioning child seats, and even if they were interested, the extent to which
consumers would purchase the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions procure child restraint systems for programs such as loaner
programs. However, only a small percentage of loaner programs carry booster seats. In any event, NHTSA believes that
any small impact on price, either positive or negative, will not have a substantial impact on these loaner programs.
Thus, these entities would not be significantly affected by this rule.

standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 62 is 7,806 metric tons (mt), determined in accordance
with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance
with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), that this third quarterly allowance soon will be reached. The Regional Director has
established a directed fishing allowance of 7,300 mt, and has set aside the remaining 506 mt as bycatch to support other
anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 62 is prohibited, effective from 12
noon, A.l.t., July 15, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., October 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;672.20(g).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the northern rockfish TAC for the Central Regulatory Area was established
by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 4,720 metric tons (mt).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), established in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii),
a directed fishing allowance for northern rockfish of 4,320 mt, with consideration that 400 mt will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in this area. The Regional Director has determined that this directed
fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for northern rockfish in
the Central Regulatory Area effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., July 14, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31,
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;672.20(g).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The American Automobile Labeling Act provides that, beginning October 1, 1994, passenger cars and other light vehicles
must be labeled with information about their domestic and foreign content. The new labels will enable consumers to
take country of origin information into account in deciding which new vehicle to purchase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes a new regulation to implement this statute. The regulation includes requirements which
apply to motor vehicle manufacturers, suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment, and motor vehicle dealers.
For model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June
1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the detailed calculation procedures set forth in
this new regulation, use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results.

Congress enacted the American Automobile Labeling Act (Labeling Act) as part of the Department of Transportation
and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;388. The Labeling Act amended Title
II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act) by adding a new section 210.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA notes that on July 5, 1994, the President signed a bill (Pub. L. 103&hyph;272) which revised and codified ``without
substantive change'' the Cost Savings Act and two other NHTSA statutes. The content labeling provisions, which formerly
existed as section 210 of the Cost Savings Act, are now codified at 49 U.S.C. 32304, Passenger motor vehicle country
of origin labeling. Since this final rule was essentially completed before the new bill was signed and since the bill
did not contain substantive changes, NHTSA is not revising the preamble of this final rule to delete references to
section 210 and cite the new statutory sections. However, the statutory citations in the regulatory text have been
updated. If the agency determines that additional conforming changes are appropriate for the regulatory text, it
will make them at a later time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 210 requires passenger motor vehicles
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 manufactured on or after October 1, 1994 to be labeled with information about their domestic and foreign content.
The purpose of the section is to enable consumers to take country of origin information into account in deciding which
vehicle to purchase.

The term ``passenger motor vehicle,'' defined in section 2(1) of the Cost Savings Act as a motor vehicle with motive
power, designed for carrying 12 persons or less, is amended for purposes of section 210 to include any ``multipurpose
passenger vehicle'' and ``light duty truck'' that is rated at 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less. Thus,
the new motor vehicle content labeling requirements apply to passenger cars, light trucks, multipurpose passenger
vehicles, and certain small buses. Motorcycles are excluded.

Section 210(b) requires each new passenger motor vehicle to be labeled with the following five items of information:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The percentage U.S./Canadian equipment (parts) content;

As discussed elsewhere in this document, for purposes of items four and five of the label, engine and transmission
country of origin determinations exclude assembly costs. Therefore, these items can also be referred to as the country
of origin of an engine's or transmission's ``parts.'' This preamble refers to these items in both manners, i.e., country
of origin for the engine (or transmission) and country of origin for the engine (or transmission) parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210(b) specifies that the first two items of information, the equipment content percentages for the U.S./Canada
and foreign countries, are calculated on a ``carline'' basis rather than for each individual vehicle. The term ``carline''
refers to a name of a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction, e.g., body, chassis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles are required to establish the required information annually for each
model year, and are responsible for the affixing of the required label to the vehicle. Dealers are responsible for
maintaining the labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to calculate the information required for the label, the vehicle manufacturer must know certain information
about the origin of each item of passenger motor vehicle equipment used to assemble its vehicles. For example, in order
to calculate the information for the first item of the label, i.e., the percentage of the value of the motor vehicle
equipment installed on passenger motor vehicles within a carline which originated in the U.S./Canada, the manufacturer
must know the U.S./Canadian content of each item of motor vehicle equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute specifies that suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment must provide information about the origin
of the equipment they supply. For purposes of determining U.S./Canadian origin for the first item on the label, the
statute provides different procedures depending on whether equipment is received from an allied supplier (a supplier
wholly owned by the manufacturer) or an outside supplier.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For equipment received from outside suppliers, section 210(f)(5)(A) provides that the equipment is considered
U.S./Canadian if it contains at least 70 percent value added in the U.S./Canada. Thus, any equipment that is at least
70 percent U.S./Canadian is valued at 100 percent U.S./Canadian, and any equipment under 70 percent is valued at zero
percent. This statutory provision is sometimes referred to as the ``roll-up, roll-down'' provision. For equipment
received from allied suppliers, section 210(f)(5)(B) provides that the actual amount of U.S./Canadian content
is used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires the Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations implementing the content labeling
requirements. Section 210(c) requires the promulgation of regulations which specify the form and content of the
required labels, and the manner and location in which the labels must be affixed. Section 210(d) requires promulgation
of such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the labeling requirements, including regulations to establish
a procedure to verify the required labeling information. That section also directs that such regulations provide
the ultimate purchaser of a new passenger motor vehicle with the best and most understandable information possible
about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary
burdens on the manufacturers. Finally, section 210(d) also specifies that the regulations include provisions requiring
suppliers to certify whether their equipment is of U.S., U.S./Canadian, or foreign origin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 210 does not specify a specific date for completing the rulemaking. However, section 210(d) does direct that
the regulations be promulgated in time to provide adequate compliance leadtime before content labeling becomes
mandatory on October 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 54351) a request for comments in order to obtain information which would be of assistance in developing a proposal
to implement section 210. To add an additional dimension to the effort to obtain public input, a public meeting was
held on December 17, 1992, during which the agency heard nine speakers. More than 20 written comments were subsequently
received by the agency, including comments from vehicle manufacturers, and manufacturer and dealer groups.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 19, 1993, NHTSA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 61042) a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for a new regulation to implement section 210. The NPRM reflected
the agency's consideration of the matters raised in the oral and written comments received in response to the request
for comments, as well as many other issues. In developing the proposed regulation, the agency necessarily followed
the language of section 210 as closely as possible. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that, given the high level of detail set forth
in the statute, the agency has little discretion with respect to many aspects of the calculation and labeling scheme.
A summary of the proposed regulation follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulation, vehicle manufacturers would be required to affix to all new passenger motor vehicles
a label which provides the five items of content information specified by section 210. The agency proposed to require
specific language for the label. The NPRM included a sample label, consistent with the proposed requirements, which
read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PARTS CONTENT of a typical vehicle makes up about (a range was to be specified in a final rule) percent of the vehicle's
total wholesale cost to the dealer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to specify the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' to draw the attention of consumers to the content
information, and indicate the subject of the information. The purpose of the proposed sub-headings ``For vehicles
in this carline'' and ``For this vehicle'' was to advise consumers which items of information relate to the carline
as a whole and which relate to the individual vehicle. The purpose of the proposed explanatory note at the bottom of
the label was to inform consumers about the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer that is attributable
to parts content, thereby helping consumers avoid confusing the parts content information specified on the label
with overall vehicle value (which would include other factors such as final assembly labor).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that vehicle manufacturers have the information necessary to calculate the information for the
content labels, NHTSA proposed to require each supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment to provide specified
information about the content of the equipment it supplies. Under the proposal, the information was to be provided
directly to the party receiving the equipment, i.e., either a vehicle manufacturer or an allied supplier, in the form
of a certification. The agency proposed specific provisions concerning when the information was to be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also proposed specific procedures for manufacturers and suppliers to follow in calculating values for the
label. One issue of particular note was which costs are to be regarded as costs incurred at the final assembly point
and beyond, including the costs of assembly and labor. Section 210 provides that these costs are not to be included
in the calculation of parts content. NHTSA noted that manufacturers may conduct some pre-assembly operations, e.g.,
production of equipment, at the same location as final assembly. The agency tentatively concluded that such operations
should be treated in the same fashion as the operations of an allied supplier. The agency proposed to specify a particular
phase in the assembly process, for both the body and chassis, that would mark the beginning of final assembly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another significant issue which NHTSA addressed in the NPRM was whether ``carline'' should encompass different
countries of assembly. At present, there are a number of vehicle models that include some vehicles assembled in the
U.S./Canada and other vehicles assembled in other countries. The agency tentatively concluded that country of final
assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations, since section 210 specifies that carline determinations
are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction. NHTSA recognized, however, that additional subdivision
of carlines by country of assembly would result in labeling information that is more representative of the individually
labeled vehicles. The agency requested comments on requiring additional labeling information for carlines assembled
in more than one country.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA also addressed the issue of whether any limited exclusions should be provided from section 210's labeling requirements.
The agency stated that it was considering whether manufacturers of vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content should
be permitted to identify the amount of such content as ``minimal'' instead of being required to calculate a specific
percentage. The agency also indicated that it was considering excluding multi-stage and low volume manufacturers
from the requirement to provide the first two items of information on the label, i.e., the two items which must be calculated
on a carline basis. NHTSA stated that, as part of considering whether any limited exclusions should be provided, the
agency was in the process of evaluating its authority to provide such exclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also proposed to require manufacturers to report certain content information to the agency, and to require
manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records of the information underlying the information provided on the content
label. The agency proposed to require dealers to maintain the content label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold
to a consumer.

II. Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency received about 80 comments on the NPRM, including ones from vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, automotive
trade associations, and private citizens. A brief, representative summary of the major comments follows. A more
specific discussion of representative comments, and the agency's responses, are set forth later in this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), representing General Motors (GM), Ford and Chrysler,
expressed concern about the timing of the final regulation. That organization stated that the proposed regulation
will require extensive data collection and calculation requirements, and that there are several areas of uncertainty
that will not be resolved until a final rule is issued. AAMA stated that it has been working in conjunction with the Automotive
Industry Action Group (AIAG) and a number of suppliers to establish processes to comply with the law, but has been unable
to complete this activity because of uncertainties about the final rule. AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers
will not be able to comply with all the data collection and calculation requirements by the October 1994 implementation
date. It requested NHTSA to allow manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar
results for at least 12 months after the final rule is published.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to expressing its concern about timing, AAMA urged the agency to make numerous changes in the proposed
regulation. On the subject of the wording of the label, that organization objected to describing the first item of
information as ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content.'' AAMA argued that the statute specifies use of the term ``U.S./Canadian
Content,'' and that the inclusion of the word ``parts'' is contrary to the statute. That commenter also recommended
against including an explanatory note concerning the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer
that is attributable to parts content. AAMA stated that such a note would be confusing to the consumer and could be misleading
because of the broad range of ratios that exist for vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also recommended a number of changes with respect to the proposed procedures for calculating the information
on the label. One of the recommendations concerned which operations should be considered part of final assembly.
That organization stated that under NHTSA's proposal, the painted body and chassis would be considered a substrate
to which passenger motor vehicle equipment is attached to produce a finished vehicle. AAMA stated that this approach
is contrary to the generally accepted definition of the passenger motor vehicle equipment assembly process. That
organization agreed, however, that the production of certain equipment at the final assembly point should not be
considered part of final assembly but should instead be included in the valuation of the motor vehicle equipment and
content calculations. AAMA recommended that the agency define ``final assembly'' to include all operations involved
in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point, including but not limited to assembly of body
panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and
assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using
stamping, machining or molding processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also recommended numerous other changes related to such things as how the value of passenger motor vehicle equipment
is determined, how the engine and transmission countries of origin are determined, the responsibilities of suppliers,
how values in the currency of one country should be converted into values in the currency of another country, the time
when the label must be attached to the vehicle, and what requirements are appropriate with respect to maintenance
of records and reporting content information to the agency. On the subject of supplier requirements, AAMA stated
that the proposal would require that suppliers report on all parts supplied to a manufacturer or allied supplier regardless
of value of the item of equipment or the country of manufacture. That organization recommended that the reporting
requirement be limited to providing content data on those items of equipment for which such data was requested by the
manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the subject of how vehicle models that are assembled in both the U.S./Canada and other countries should be treated,
AAMA stated that the statute contains a sufficient definition of ``carline'' and that additional information should
not be provided on the label to indicate that a carline is produced in more than one country. That organization stated
that separate content calculations, one set for each assembly country and the entire carline, would cause unnecessary
burdens and confuse the consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the subject of possible exclusions, AAMA supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content, albeit at a lower content level from that discussed in the NPRM. AAMA also stated that since the agency ``has
implied'' that it has the authority to set a minimal level for the U.S. and Canadian content which removes a recordkeeping
burden on the low end of content, it urged that such relief also be provided for the high end of content. That organization
recommended that, for carlines with more than 85 percent U.S./Canadian content, manufacturers be permitted to specify
the content as ``at least'' 85 percent instead of stating a specific percentage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GM, Ford and Chrysler also each submitted individual comments. To a large extent, these comments reiterated arguments
made by AAMA. An additional argument made by GM concerned the calculation methodology for determining the percentage
U.S./Canadian content for a carline. GM stated that the agency had proposed that the proper method to establish the
U.S./Canadian content for a carline would be to reasonably project the installation rates for all equipment options
and choice offered on that carline; multiply those rates by the U.S./Canadian content value for each option or choice,
and divide the result by the total value for all equipment, domestic or foreign. That company stated that it has found
for cost management and planning purposes that the use of a high volume configuration carline model results in better
management control of the assembly process than the so-called average equipped carline model. GM stated that such
a model has found wide acceptance in calculations made for corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) emission testing
configurations and most recently for vehicle configurations under NAFTA. That company recommended that the agency
permit manufacturers to use established carline cost management models for establishing the percentage U.S./Canadian
content required to be included in the AALA domestic content label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foreign vehicle manufacturers also recommended numerous changes in the proposed requirements, but often from a
very different perspective from that of the domestic vehicle manufacturers. For example, while the domestic manufacturers
urged a change in the proposed definition of ``final assembly'' so that it is considered to begin earlier in the vehicle
manufacturing process, the foreign manufacturers generally urged changes in the definition so that it is considered
to begin later in the vehicle manufacturing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM) and Toyota stated that the point of final assembly
should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and vehicle body are fastened together. AIAM
argued that the Labeling Act defines ``final assembly'' as the time when ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical
operation of such automobile are included,'' and stated that the proposed definition would defy the stated intent
of the Act and defy all conventional wisdom with respect to the automotive manufacturing process. Nissan stated that
an appropriate point to be identified as the beginning of final assembly is the moment in the production process just
before the attachment of the engine and drive train to the chassis. Mitsubishi stated that the point where final assembly
begins should be defined as the point at which the engine and body are fastened. According to that company, this would
be more consistent with the agency's proposed definition of ``final assembly point'', where all components and parts
necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW commented that NHTSA's proposal defined ``final assembly'' with regard to the body as the point at which the body
leaves the paint shop. That company stated that this portion of the definition is very precise and that the costs associated
with it will likely be similar between manufacturers regardless of painting process or vehicle design. BMW commented,
however, with regard to definition of final assembly of the chassis, that it believes a manufacturer would be able
to tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition and alter its carline's part content percentages.
That company stated that this portion of the definition employs the point at which the engine and transmission are
placed on the chassis frame or on the assembly cradle. According to BMW, because this point can be varied, a manufacturer
would have the opportunity to install or not install equipment such as the brake system including ABS, wheels and tires,
and interior components and trim. BMW commented that a manufacturer could choose to install the engine last, essentially
including all labor and overhead in its parts content calculations. BMW recommended that the agency investigate
assembly processes and include a more definitive point to stop including costs associated with the chassis assembly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foreign vehicle manufacturers also generally had very different views than the domestic manufacturers with
respect to the treatment of vehicle models including some vehicles assembled in the U.S./Canada and other vehicles
assembled in other countries. AIAM stated that failing to allow manufacturers to distinguish between countries
of production within a particular carline directly contradicts the Act's stated purpose of providing consumers
with the best and most understandable information possible. That organization stated that it believes that NHTSA
has the authority to adopt a country of production split for determining the parts content percentages for carlines,
in order to follow the stated intent of the Act. According to AIAM, without carline subdivision, the information presented
to the consumer will be at best misleading, and at worst totally inaccurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) urged that separate calculations for carlines manufactured
in more than one country at least be permitted. That organization stated that the failure to specify such percentages
separately would result in an overstated domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically
produced vehicles. According to JAMA, the U.S. consumer cannot possibly be served by such misleading information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While numerous foreign vehicle manufacturers objected to the agency's proposal to exclude country of assembly as
a factor to consider in making carline determinations, several indicated that, if NHTSA did not change that position,
they supported the concept of providing additional information on the label concerning such vehicles. Honda, for
example, stated that such additional information would improve the accuracy of the information provided to the consumer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foreign vehicle manufacturers differed among themselves on the question of whether an explanatory note should
be provided concerning the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer that is attributable to
parts content. AIAM, for example, stated that such additional information would only serve to confuse the consumer,
and that a single percentage range to be used by all manufacturers cannot adequately illustrate the many variations
involved in the manufacture and distribution of motor vehicles. JAMA, however, argued that it is vital to consumer
understanding to clarify the fact that the label calculation does not include vehicle final assembly labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foreign vehicle manufacturers strongly supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content. However, several of them argued that unless the agency also permits a limited exclusion from providing the
information required for item two of the label, i.e., the percentage parts content originating from major sources
of foreign content, there would be only a minimal benefit from an exclusion from specifying the percentage U.S./Canadian
parts content. This is because the foreign manufacturers would have to collect detailed information from most of
their suppliers to calculate the information for item two of the label. The foreign manufacturers suggested various
alternative approaches, such as requiring them to specify the countries that constitute major sources of foreign
content but not the percentages from such countries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like the domestic vehicle manufacturers, the foreign manufacturers recommended numerous other changes in the proposed
regulation, relating to such things as how the value of passenger motor vehicle equipment is determined, how the engine
and transmission countries of origin are determined, the responsibilities of suppliers, how currencies should
be converted, the time when the label must be attached to the vehicle, and what requirements are appropriate with respect
to maintenance of records and reporting content information to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received comments from several suppliers and one supplier trade association, the Automotive Parts Manufacturers'
Association (APMA). That association stated that if the agency does not adopt the AIAG model of content calculation,
the regulation should specifically state how outside suppliers should calculate U.S./Canadian content. APMA stated
that the proposed rule relies on the definitions of ``value added'' and ``foreign content'' in the statute, but that
neither the statute nor the regulation give specific regulatory direction concerning how outside suppliers are
to calculate ``value added in the U.S./Canada.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also received comments from two dealer associations, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)
and the American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA). These organizations submitted comments
which focused on dealer responsibilities and other issues of concern to dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also received comments from final stage manufacturers and the National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA),
a trade association representing distributors and manufacturers of multi-stage produced work-related trucks,
truck bodies and equipment. These comments focused on issues of concern to final stage manufacturers.

III. Overview of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's final rule establishes a new regulation, 49 CFR Part 583, Automobile Parts Content Labeling, to implement
section 210 of the Cost Savings Act. The regulation establishes requirements for (1) Manufacturers of passenger
motor vehicles; (2) suppliers of motor vehicle equipment used in the assembly of passenger motor vehicles; and (3)
dealers of passenger motor vehicles. A summary of the requirements is set forth below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning on October 1, 1994, vehicle manufacturers are required to affix to all new passenger motor vehicles (this
category includes passenger cars, certain small buses, and all trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles with
a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds or less) a label which provides the following information:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information for items (1) and (2) of the label is calculated, prior to the beginning of the model year, for each carline.
The information for items (3), (4) and (5) is determined for each individual vehicle. However, the country of origin
for groups of engines and transmissions is determined once a model year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vehicle manufacturers are to calculate the information for the label by using information provided to them by suppliers.
Under the final rule, manufacturers and allied suppliers are required to request their suppliers to provide the relevant
content information specified in Part 583, and the suppliers are required to provide the specified information in
response to such requests. The vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain records of the information used to
determine the information provided on the labels.

B. Suppliers of Motor Vehicle Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For any equipment that an outside supplier (a supplier not wholly owned by the vehicle manufacturer) supplies to a
vehicle manufacturer or to a supplier wholly owned by the vehicle manufacturer (an allied supplier), the outside
supplier is required to provide, at the request of that manufacturer or allied supplier, the following information:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer or allied supplier; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the equipment has, or does not have, at least 70 percent of its value added in the U.S. and Canada; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For any equipment for which the U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent, the country of origin of the equipment
(treating the U.S. and Canada together); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For equipment that may be used in an engine or transmission, the country of origin of the equipment (separating
the U.S. and Canada). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any equipment that an allied supplier supplies to a vehicle manufacturer, the supplier is required to provide,
at the request of the manufacturer, the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For equipment that may be used in an engine or transmission, the country of origin of the equipment (separating
the U.S. and Canada). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A supplier of engines and transmissions is, in addition to the above requirements, required to provide, at the request
of the vehicle manufacturer, the country of origin for each engine or transmission it supplies to the manufacturer,
determined as follows: The country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using the total cost of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the engine or transmission supplier, while excluding the cost of final assembly labor), was added to the engine
or transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both outside and allied suppliers that directly supply equipment to vehicle manufacturers are required to provide
the specified information directly to the vehicle manufacturers, in the form of a certification. Outside suppliers
that directly supply to allied suppliers are required to provide the specified information and certification directly
to the allied suppliers. Suppliers are also required to maintain records of the information used to compile the information
provided to the manufacturers and outside suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements apply only to suppliers which supply directly to the vehicle manufacturer or to an allied supplier.
No requirements are imposed on suppliers earlier in the chain, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a company which supplies an item of equipment to an outside supplier which then supplies it to a vehicle manufacturer.

IV. Agency Rationale and Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Major Issues Concerning Information on the Label
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this section of the preamble, NHTSA presents its analysis of the major issues and comments concerning the information
on the label, including, but not limited to, ones relating to what information is provided on the label and the wording
of the label, how manufacturers must calculate the specified information, and how suppliers are to make the necessary
determinations concerning the origin of the equipment they supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ease of comparison with the proposed regulation, the discussion of issues is generally organized according to
the sections of the proposed regulation to which they relate. The agency notes that in some cases the cited sections
are relevant not only to the major issues concerning the information on the label, but also to other issues. The other
issues are discussed elsewhere in the preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definitions (Section 583.4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions section prescribes the meaning of terms and concepts which are used throughout the content labeling
regulation. As discussed below, some of the terms and concepts have a significant effect on the information to be provided
on the label, and some of the proposed definitions were controversial with many commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Carline. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210(b) specifies that U.S./Canadian parts content and major sources of foreign parts content (items one
and two on the label) are determined on a ``carline'' basis, instead of for each individual vehicle. Section 210(f)
defines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
carline 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as meaning a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction (e.g., body, chassis),
and not considering any level of decor or opulence and not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roof
line, number of doors, seats, or windows, except for light duty trucks. That section also provides that light duty
trucks are considered to be different carlines than passenger cars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA addressed a number of issues in the NPRM concerning whether the meaning of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
carline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be further clarified by regulation. One significant issue was whether 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
carline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should encompass vehicles assembled in different countries. At present, there are a number of vehicle models that
are assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada and in other countries. The agency tentatively concluded that country of final
assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations, since section 210 specifies that carline determinations
are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency noted that determining carlines on the basis of country of assembly appears inconsistent with this statutory
definition since 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
identical
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cars, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ones with total commonality in construction, could be placed in different carlines. NHTSA also noted that such a
result might result in consumer confusion. For example, if a consumer ordered a car identical to one for which he or
she had taken a test drive, the consumer would find it very odd if the car he or she received had a label indicating that
it was in a different carline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA recognized, however, that additional subdivision of carlines by country of manufacture would result in content
labeling information that is more representative of the individually labeled vehicles. The agency requested comments
on a possible requirement for manufacturers to include additional information on the label for carlines assembled
in more than one country, such as a statement of the U.S./Canadian parts content and major foreign sources of that portion
of the carline produced in a given country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also requested comments on the possibility of differentiating carlines by engine type, whether light trucks
should be separated into different carlines depending on whether they are 2-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive, and on whether
any other distinctions should be specified for making carline determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received numerous comments concerning the definition of carline. In the discussion which follows, the agency
will first address comments concerning the issue of whether ``carline'' should encompass vehicles assembled in
different countries, and the related issue of a possible requirement for manufacturers to include additional information
on the label for carlines assembled in more than one country. The agency will then discuss other issues related to the
definition of carline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carline and different countries of assembly.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AAMA supported NHTSA's tentative conclusion that carline is not distinguished by country of final assembly. That
organization noted that the statutory definition is similar to the definition used in other Federal regulations
and is also used in industry to establish carlines. AAMA argued that to maintain consistency among Federal regulations
and to minimize the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of carline used for the Labeling Act
should be the same as those used for CAFE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also commented that it disagrees with including additional information on the label for carlines that are assembled
in more than one country. That organization argued that separate content carline calculations, one set for each assembly
country and the entire carline, would cause unnecessary burden and confuse consumers. According to AAMA, this method
would create the same or more confusion than allowing manufacturers to separate carlines based on country of assembly.
That organization also commented that vehicles produced in both the U.S. and Canada would have similar content values,
and listing information twice would cause confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the United Auto Workers (UAW) did not submit a comment on the NPRM, it made the following argument in response
to the agency's 1992 request for comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(I)n doing the model line calculations, imported vehicles must be combined with vehicles produced in the United States.
The automakers do not have the option of splitting the two groups of vehicles. The definition of ``carline'' in the
new statute is based on the definition under the CAFE program. Since those standards do not permit foreign and domestic
versions of the same carline to be split, this should not be allowed under the vehicle content labeling statute.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

AIAM commented that failing to allow manufacturers to distinguish between countries of production within a particular
carline directly contradicts the Act's stated purpose of providing consumers with the best and most understandable
information possible. That organization stated that it believes that NHTSA has the authority to adopt a country-of-production
split for determining the parts content percentages for carlines, in order to follow this stated intent of the Act.
According to AIAM, without carline subdivision, the information presented to the consumer will be at best misleading,
and at worst totally inaccurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JAMA urged that separate calculations for carlines manufactured in more than one country at least be permitted. That
organization stated that the failure to specify such percentages separately would result in an overstated domestic
content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles. According to JAMA, the U.S.
consumer cannot possibly be served by such misleading information.

Toyota stated that it believes the agency's tentative conclusion that country of assembly should not be considered
in making carline determinations is incorrect as a matter of statutory construction and Congressional intent. It
argued that the statute does not compel NHTSA to require averaging of equipment content information on a worldwide
basis for a particular carline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota stated that since section 210(b)(1)(A) requires disclosure of the percentage of U.S./Canadian-origin equipment
``installed on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
such
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 vehicle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a carline,'' the Labeling Act contemplates that the percentage disclosed will have a relationship to both the individual
vehicle and the carline to which it belongs. (Emphasis in Toyota's comment.) That company recognized that section
210(b)(2) requires the calculation of the percentage to made ``for such carline,'' but argued that it is incorrect
to read section 210(b)(2) out of context and ``in disregard of the requirement imposed by the literal language of section
210(b)(1)(A).'' Toyota argued that a model carline percentage that fails to approximate the level of content on the
particular vehicle would not satisfy this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota also argued that the lack of a reference in the statutory definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
carline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the country or countries where a carline is assembled indicates that the agency may exercise a level of discretion
in determining how the (b)(1)(A) calculation is to be performed with respect to carlines manufactured in multiple
countries. That company stated that NHTSA's exercise of that discretion should be guided by section 210(d)'s requirement
that the ultimate purchaser should be provided ``the best and most understandable information possible.'' Toyota
argued that consumers reading the label will expect the equipment content percentages disclosed on the label to apply
to a class of vehicles of which the particular vehicle being observed is representative. That company argued that
any such disclosure that attempts to average, for example, vehicles manufactured in the United States or Canada with
vehicles manufactured in Japan cannot possibly provide the consumer with meaningful information because of dissimilarity
with respect to the sourcing of equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota also argued that it believes the treatment of carline under CAFE regulations is irrelevant to the issue of whether
Labeling Act equipment content reporting must be averaged for a carline produced in more than one country. That company
argued that the two statutes have completely different purposes. Toyota stated that it may be appropriate under CAFE
to average fuel economy data, because fuel economy of a carline is determined by vehicle design, an element that vehicles
in a carline have in common regardless of where they are produced. That commenter stated that the opposite is the case
for sourcing patterns, which typically differ greatly by country of manufacture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda argued that the agency's tentative decision to combine ``dual nationality'' nameplates into a single carline
is fundamentally inconsistent with the stated goal of the sponsor of the legislation_providing consumers sufficient
information to ``buy American'' if they so choose. That company argued that, under the agency's proposal, the domestic
content of the equipment on U.S./Canadian built ``dual nationality'' vehicles will be understated, while the domestic
content of the equipment on their foreign-built twins will be overstated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that there is no reason to read the law to require such a result that it believes would frustrate the fundamental
purpose of the Labeling Act. It noted the agency's stated concern that determining carlines based on country of origin
would permit identical cars to be placed in different carlines, and argued that this result will occur under the agency's
proposal. That company cited the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable as an example. Honda also cited NHTSA's stated concern
that consumers might be confused if they took delivery of a vehicle with a label indicating a different ``carline''
than the vehicle they test drove. That company stated that this potential for confusion is not greater than that which
might arise if the delivered vehicle shows a different final assembly point or country of origin of the engine or transmission
than those on the label of the test driven model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BMW also disagreed with the agency's tentative conclusion that country of assembly should not be considered in making
carline determinations. First, that company argued that the Labeling Act does not prohibit division of vehicles
by country. That company stated that given the fact that Congress defined 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
carline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a ``name,'' which is generally assigned by a manufacturer, it believes Congress intended carlines to be established
by manufacturers. BMW stated that it believes Congress was attempting to alleviate the burden on manufacturers by
giving them the maximum flexibility to group vehicles together, while not allowing completely unrelated vehicles
to be incorporated into one set of parts content calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW argued that Congress placed the restriction of having ``commonality in construction'' to define the largest
grouping by which a manufacturer is allowed to divide its vehicles. According to that company, this portion of the
definition was not intended to force manufacturers to group vehicles together but rather to limit the vehicles that
could be forced together into a carline. BMW stated that if the Congress had intended to force such a grouping on manufacturers,
it would have explicitly defined 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
carline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a ``name denoting a group that shall include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 vehicles which have a degree of commonality in construction.'' (Emphasis in BMW's comment.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, BMW argued that information based on a vehicle's country of origin would be the most accurate and understandable
to the consumer. That company noted the agency's statement in the NPRM that consumers might be confused if identical
vehicles are considered to be in different carlines. BMW argued that this should not be a concern because such differences
would provide better and more accurate information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, BMW argued that NHTSA's tentative conclusion directly conflicts with the portion of section 210 that requires
the best and most understandable information. That company argued that the latter requirement should take precedence.
BMW recommended that, rather than debating such issues as the Congressional intent of the carline definition, the
agency should use the definition as worded in the legislation and permit manufacturers to make independent interpretations
to achieve this goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While numerous foreign vehicle manufacturers, including ones in addition to those mentioned above, objected to
the agency's proposal to exclude country of assembly as a factor to consider in making carline determinations, several
indicated that, if NHTSA did not change that position, they supported the concept of providing additional information
on the label concerning such vehicles. Toyota stated that requiring this additional information (or alternatively,
allowing a manufacturer to include it on the label on its own option) is preferable to requiring (or permitting) only
disclosure of an average percentage for a carline on a worldwide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that such additional information would improve the accuracy of the information provided to the consumer.
It suggested the following language: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This carline is produced in both the United States [or Canada, as appropriate] and [add name of other country]. The
U.S./Canadian parts content for vehicles manufactured in the location noted in line three of this label is [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
]%.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nissan stated that if manufacturers are not permitted to separate parts content percentage calculation by production
country origin, then each manufacturer should be permitted the option to determine the most appropriate method to
provide additional information or explanation of a label's parts content percentages to a potential vehicle purchaser.
That company argued that NHTSA should not prohibit the manufacturer from providing additional explanations or require
the manufacturer to include generic wording to clarify the U.S./Canadian parts content percentage calculation
to consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully considering all of the comments, NHTSA has decided that carline determinations may not be based on
country of assembly, but manufacturers should be permitted to provide specified additional information for carlines
assembled in both the U.S./Canada and another country. In reaching this decision, the agency has focused both on the
Labeling Act's provisions related to ``carline'' and on section 210(d)'s requirement that regulations ``provide
to the ultimate purchaser the best and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada
origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In enacting the Labeling Act, Congress decided that the parts content percentages for the U.S./Canada and foreign
countries should be calculated for groups of vehicles rather than for each individual vehicle. It also decided to
adopt the concept of ``carline'' and its definition from the CAFE program, as the basis for determining the relevant
groups of vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210 expressly states that carline determinations are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction.
Basing carline determinations on country of assembly would be a very different method for making carline determinations,
and one that is inconsistent with the method specified in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, NHTSA disagrees with those commenters which argued that carline determinations which exclude considerations
of country of assembly are inconsistent with the purpose of the Labeling Act. First, the concept of ``carline'' is
well understood by Congress, given its use in the CAFE program. Since Congress decided to use this well-known concept
as the basis for making vehicle groupings under the Labeling Act, it is reasonable to assume that the concept is consistent
with the purpose of Congress. The agency observes that while many foreign vehicle manufacturers argued that basing
carline determinations solely on commonality of construction is inconsistent with the purpose of Congress, this
view was not shared by GM, Ford, Chrysler, or the UAW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency specifically rejects Toyota's argument that the treatment of carline under CAFE is irrelevant to Labeling
Act issues. Since Congress decided to adopt the same concept and definition for grouping vehicles as used in CAFE,
the treatment under CAFE is highly relevant. The agency notes that Toyota's objection and the objections of many of
the foreign vehicle manufacturers are ultimately with the statute rather than the agency's proposed regulations.
Toyota suggests that ``(i)t may be appropriate under CAFE to average fuel economy data, because fuel economy of a carline
is determined by vehicle design,'' but argues that ``(t)he opposite is the case for sourcing patterns, which typically
differ greatly by country of manufacture.'' However, the Labeling Act expressly requires carline determinations
to be determined based on ``commonality of construction,'' i.e., vehicle design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the mere fact that the exclusion of country of assembly from carline determinations can result in overstated
domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles does not mean that
the results are misleading. Any approach in which U.S./Canadian parts content is determined based on groups of vehicles
will result in situations where the content is overstated or understated for individual vehicles within the group.
However, prospective purchasers will know the U.S./Canadian parts content for the group as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if a particular make/model is assembled in both the U.S./Canada and another country, consumers will
know the average U.S./Canadian content for that make/model. The agency believes that this is relevant information
for consumers which wish to buy a vehicle made in the U.S. or Canada. Moreover, the carline information is not the only
information that Congress decided to require on the label. Consumers will also know where the individual vehicle
is assembled, and the countries of origin of the engine and transmission for that individual vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with several of the statutory arguments made by commenters favoring determination of carlines based
on country of assembly. As discussed above, Toyota argued that section 210(b)(1)(A)'s requirement that the label
indicate the percentage U.S./Canadian equipment ``installed on such vehicle within a carline'' amounts to a requirement
that the carline percentage must ``approximate the level of content'' on each individual vehicle. However, the quoted
language of section 210(b)(1)(A) simply means that the percentage to be provided on the label is for the carline of
which the individual vehicle is a part, as is made clear by section 210(b). There is no basis to read section 210(b)(1)(A)
as requiring the percentage to apply to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the individual vehicle and the carline. If content is determined for a group of vehicles, it necessarily follows that
the content of each individual vehicle may vary from that of the group as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also disagrees with BMW's argument that the statutory definition of carline is merely intended to define
the largest grouping by which a manufacturer is permitted to divide its vehicles but not preclude further divisions
in making carline determinations. NHTSA notes that in addition to specifying ``commonality in construction'' as
the basis for making carline determinations, the section 210 definition provides that even some attributes that
are part of ``commonality in construction,'' e.g., level of decor, are not to be considered in making carline determinations.
Moreover, manufacturers are not permitted to make unlimited divisions for purposes of CAFE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also disagrees with BMW's suggestion that the agency should essentially permit manufacturers to interpret
the term ``carline'' in any way they choose. In addition to being concerned that the implementing regulations ensure
results that are consistent with the statutory requirements, NHTSA also believes it is important that consumers
be provided with information that is consistent among manufacturers. It would be very confusing to consumers if they
were provided with content information determined on a carline basis by each manufacturer, but the meaning of ``carline''
varied substantially among manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NHTSA has concluded, for the reasons stated above, that carline determinations may not be based on country of
assembly, it recognizes that additional subdivision of carlines by country of manufacture would result in content
labeling information that is more representative of the individually labeled vehicles. NHTSA does not believe it
would be appropriate to permit unlimited additional information to be provided on the label, since such additional
information could result in an ``overload'' to consumers and dilute the impact of the required information. However,
given the potential significance of the impact that assembly of a carline in both the U.S./Canada and other countries
may have on the representativeness of the carline information provided on the label, NHTSA has decided to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
permit,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 but not require, the following additional statement to be provided on the label: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This carline is assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada, and in [insert name of each other country]. The U.S./Canadian
parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in [insert name of country, treating the U.S. and Canada together,
i.e., U.S./Canada] is [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
]%.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is specifying specific language for the optional information to ensure that it is both brief and easily
understood, as well as to maintain consistency among manufacturers. If a manufacturer chooses to provide this optional
information, the information must be provided at the end of the label, as part of the explanatory note. Moreover, if
the additional information is provided for some vehicles within a carline, it must be provided for all vehicles within
the carline. Otherwise, a manufacturer might provide the additional information only for the portion of the carline
which has higher U.S./Canadian parts content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that permitting but not requiring manufacturers to provide this additional information is appropriate
in light of the statutory requirement that the implementing regulation ``provide to the ultimate purchaser the best
and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles
without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.'' The agency believes that the usefulness
of the additional information to consumers is not of a level that justifies requiring it, but is sufficiently useful
that manufacturers should be permitted to provide it if they so choose.

Other issues related to the definition of ``Carline.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NHTSA received a number of comments concerning whether engine types, body styles, and/or drive systems should be
considered in making carline determinations. The agency notes that these factors, unlike country of assembly, are
related to degree of commonality in construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, AAMA argued that to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize the administrative
burden, the definitions and interpretation of ``carline'' used for the Labeling Act should be the same as those used
for CAFE. That organization stated that there should be no further segregation of carlines by engine type, and that
light trucks should not be divided by type of driveline. According to AAMA, these separations would not provide more
meaningful information to the consumer. That commenter stated that items such as 4-wheel drive and engine types are
customer options and should not be used to differentiate carlines. AAMA noted that differences in engine sourcing
will be reflected on the label under country of origin of the engine. AAMA stated that it supports the agency's proposal
not to subdivide the carline definition for sedans and station wagons or fuel economy model types. It argued that adding
more characteristics to define carline would increase the compliance costs to the vehicle manufacturer, would not
add any value to the label, and would confuse the customer. It stated that the proposed definition should be revised
by deleting a sentence stating that 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive versions of light trucks are treated as separate carlines,
and by replacing a reference to ``utility vehicles'' with the term ``special purpose vehicles.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota argued that manufacturers should have the option of separating carlines by engines and by drive systems. That
manufacturer stated that such separations would further the Act's purpose of providing the consumer information
on equipment content, by giving consumers more precise content information for the particular model being considered
for purchase. Toyota stated that because this would create an additional burden, it should be at the option of the manufacturer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that it supports differentiating carlines by engine type, because such separation would improve the
accuracy of the information on the label. That company stated that sourcing of parts may be different for different
engine types. Honda indicated that it strongly supports retaining station wagons within the carline of the same name,
consistent with EPA's inclusion of station wagons within the carline of the same name for purposes of computing the
carline's domestic content for CAFE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that with respect to differentiating carline by engine type and drive type, it believes the relevant portion
of the carline definition is for the purpose of providing relief to manufacturers rather than imposing a requirement
on them. It stated that it believes that using the definition verbatim from the legislation and allowing manufacturers
discretion to decide which models to include in the carline calculations, in conjunction with clarification from
the manufacturer of the models that were used in the calculations, would result in the best and most accurate information
to potential consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissan stated that it believes carlines should not be separated by engine types, body styles or drive systems. According
to that manufacturer, it would take a major change in the foreign content of those parts to result in a significant change
in carline content percentages. Nissan stated that additional calculation and the resulting record keeping requirements
by engine types, body styles, and drive systems would impose a significant administrative burden on manufacturers,
and would not result in an appreciable increase in the accuracy of the content information on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that engine types and drive systems should not be considered
in making carline determinations. These features are typically customer options for particular make/models, similar
to options related to level of decor. The agency believes that these features are too insignificant to be considered
in making carline determinations, i.e., if vehicles are essentially the same except for the fact that one has a larger
engine or 4-wheel drive, there is sufficient commonality of construction that the vehicles should be in the same carline.
NHTSA does not believe that a manufacturer option should be provided in this area, because it could confuse consumers
if ``carline'' has a different meaning for different vehicles. Moreover, the agency believes that separation by
engine type and drive system would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the content percentages provided on
the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also generally agrees with AAMA that, to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize
the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of ``carline'' used for the Labeling Act should be
the same as those used for CAFE. NHTSA notes that station wagons are included in the same carline as similar sedans,
as in CAFE. This follows from section 210's language that carline is not generally distinguished by such characteristics
as roof line, except for light duty trucks. Consistent with CAFE, special purpose vehicles, vans and pickup trucks
are considered to be in different carlines.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 210 provides that costs incurred at the final assembly point and beyond, including the costs of assembly and
labor, are not included in the calculation of parts content. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that manufacturers may conduct
some pre-assembly operations, e.g., production of equipment, at the same location as final assembly. The agency
tentatively concluded that such operations should be treated the same as the operations of an allied supplier. The
agency proposed to specify a particular phase in the assembly process, for both the body and chassis, that would mark
the beginning of final assembly. This was reflected in specific proposed definitions for ``final assembly'' and
``final assembly point.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA stated that under NHTSA's proposal, the painted body and chassis would be considered a substrate to which passenger
motor vehicle equipment is attached to produce a finished vehicle. AAMA stated that this approach is contrary to the
generally accepted definition of the passenger motor vehicle equipment assembly process. That organization agreed,
however, that the production of certain equipment at the final assembly point should not be considered part of final
assembly but should instead be included in the valuation of the motor vehicle equipment and content calculations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AAMA recommended that the agency define ``final assembly'' to include all operations involved in the assembly of
the vehicle performed at the final assembly point, including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting,
final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the
fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining
or molding processes. AAMA stated that its definition is consistent with the statute and an improvement over the proposal
in that it (1) eliminates the conflict between regulations and normal business practice, (2) eliminates the ability
of a manufacturer to generate a considerable amount of U.S./Canadian value added for the assembly operation that
the proposed regulations would allow prior to the ``final assembly,'' (3) eliminates ability of a manufacturer to
shift value added simply by establishing ``transfer'' prices for all of the passenger motor vehicle equipment that
is produced prior to ``final assembly,'' and (4) eliminates the burden on a manufacturer associated with changing
systems simply to meet NHTSA's proposed definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also recommended that the agency change the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly point,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in a manner consistent with its recommendation concerning the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That commenter also stated that the proposed definition creates ambiguity by introducing the term ``pre-final assembly,''
and that the proposed regulation does not state how this equipment is to be treated for determining origin. AAMA recommended
a specific definition for ``final assembly point.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford stated that it agrees that in-plant pre-assembly and manufacturing should be included in the domestic and foreign
content of the vehicle and the value treated as operations of an allied supplier. It argued, however, that the proposed
definition of ``final assembly'' goes beyond the point that most manufacturers track parts cost. Ford stated that
operations performed at the final assembly point, including body assembly and painting, are usually not contained
in the manufacturer's final assembly bill of material. Ford argued that in-plant pre-assembly should include only
machining, stamping, molding operations, and engine or transmission assembly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIAM stated that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and
vehicle body are fastened together. That organization argued that the Labeling Act defines final assembly as the
time when ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included.'' AIAM stated
that the proposed definition would defy the stated intent of the Act and defy all conventional wisdom with respect
to the automotive manufacturing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota also argued that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine
and vehicle body are fastened together. It stated that for any vehicle, regardless of the sequence of assembly operations,
there is always a point where the engine is united with the body. According to Toyota, section 210(f)(14) defines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
point of final assembly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in terms of completeness. That commenter argued that the proposed final assembly points for the body and chassis are
inconsistent with the Act because all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of the vehicle are not
yet present and included with the vehicle at those points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota also stated that the point of final assembly must serve as the point before which assembly labor is included
in the calculation and after which it is not. That manufacturer stated that the proposed regulation is not clear with
respect to whether labor used in manufacturing the body after the point at which it emerges from painting but before
it is attached to the chassis or cradle is included or excluded. Toyota stated that only by specifying a single point
of final assembly can this technical problem be solved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other foreign vehicle manufacturers made similar comments. Nissan stated that an appropriate point to be
identified as the beginning of final assembly is the moment in the production process just before the attachment of
the engine and drive train to the chassis. Mitsubishi stated that the point where final assembly begins should be defined
as the point at which the engine and body are fastened. According to that company, this would be more consistent with
the agency's proposed definition of ``final assembly point,'' where all components and parts necessary to the mechanical
operation of such automobile are included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda took a different position in its comment. That manufacturer stated that it strongly supports the agency's proposal
to treat in-house production of parts and components as if the equipment were produced by an allied supplier. Honda
stated that this is necessary for consistency among manufacturers. Noting that the agency proposed to define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly point
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a particular phase in the assembly process, Honda stated that the proposed treatment of this issue is sensible.
According to that manufacturer, defining ``final assembly point'' as the moment in the process at which the body leaves
the paint shop is generally appropriate. However, Honda requested clarification of this definition with respect
to the substantial additional ``pre-final assembly'' work that remains to be performed on its vehicles' doors after
the body leaves the paint shop. Honda argued that door subassembly labor should be included within computation of
U.S./Canadian value added, and stated that it assumes this subassembly labor would be included under the proposed
regulation because the work is performed off the main assembly line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that NHTSA's proposal defined ``final assembly'' with regard to the body as the point at which the body leaves
the paint shop. That company commented that this portion of the definition is very precise and that the costs associated
with it will likely be similar between manufacturers regardless of painting process or vehicle design. BMW commented,
however, with regard to definition of final assembly of the chassis, that it believes a manufacturer would be able
to tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition and alter its carline's part content percentages.
That company stated that this portion of the definition employs the point at which the engine and transmission are
placed on the chassis frame or on the assembly cradle. According to BMW, because this point can be varied, a manufacturer
would have the opportunity to install or not install equipment such as the brake system including ABS, wheels and tires,
and interior components and trim. BMW commented that a manufacturer could choose to install the engine last, essentially
including all labor and overhead in its parts content calculations. BMW recommended that the agency investigate
assembly processes and include a more definitive point to stop including costs associated with the chassis assembly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that the comments concerning the proposed definitions for ``final assembly'' and ``final assembly
point'' raise two important, related issues: (1) What operations should be considered to be part of ``final assembly''
and therefore excluded from parts content calculations, and (2) Whether the proposed regulation distinguishes
such operations in a manner that is appropriate for all manufacturers. As discussed below, after considering the
comments in light of these two issues, the agency has concluded that definitions along the lines of those recommended
by AAMA should be adopted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The starting place for resolving the question of what operations should be considered to be part of ``final assembly''
and therefore excluded from parts content calculations is the language of the Labeling Act. The Act includes several
relevant sections. First, section 210(b)(1)(A) provides that the label must indicate ``the percentage (by value)
of passenger motor vehicle equipment installed in such vehicle within a carline which originated in the United States
and Canada *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Second, section 210(f)(10) provides that ``(c)osts incurred or profits made 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at the final vehicle assembly point
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and beyond (i.e., advertising, assembly, labor, interest payments, profits, etc.) shall not be included in [the
calculation of value added in the United States and Canada].'' Third, section 210(f)(14) defines ``final assembly
point'' as ``the plant, factory, or other 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
place 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a manufacturer and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
from
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which such vehicle is delivered to a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the
mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis added.).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While final assembly point can be considered as either a physical place or a phase in the assembly process, it is significant
that section 210 defines it as a place, i.e., the plant, factory, or other place at which a new vehicle is produced or
assembled. Thus, looking at the plain language of section 210, assembly and labor costs ``at'' the plant, factory
or other place at which a new vehicle is assembled are excluded from parts content calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also significant that the language in section 210(f)(14) about the vehicle being in such a condition that ``all
component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle'' refers
to the vehicle when it leaves the final assembly point for delivery to a dealer or importer. In citing this language
for the proposition that ``final assembly'' is defined in terms of completeness, AIAM and Toyota confuse the completion
of final assembly with the final assembly process. Section 210(f)(14) defines ``final assembly point'' as the plant,
factory, or other place at which a vehicle is ``produced or assembled'' by a manufacturer. All of the operations that
make up the production or assembly process are part of final assembly. There is no basis to interpret section 210(f)(10)'s
requirement that assembly and labor costs incurred ``at the plant, factory or other place'' at which a new vehicle
is assembled only applies to the costs associated with the last step in completing the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since section 210 expressly provides that assembly and labor costs at the plant, factory or other place at which a new
vehicle is assembled are excluded from parts content calculations, NHTSA believes that all assembly and labor costs
that are ordinarily associated with final assembly must be excluded. However, the agency believes that the costs
associated with parts production that may occur at a final assembly plant should not be excluded from parts content
calculations. The agency notes the following argument made by the UAW in commenting on the request for comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 in section 210(f)(4) of the statute refers to components ``received at the final vehicle assembly point.'' Section
210(f)(14) then goes on to define ``final assembly point'' as meaning ``the plant, factory, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
or other place
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis in UAW comment.)
We believe these definitions can and should be interpreted liberally to include parts and components which are built
``in-house'' within the scope of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment.'' Even though such parts and components may
be built in the same manufacturing facility, they are still built in a different ``place'' than where the vehicles
are actually assembled (i.e., in a different department or operation within the plant)&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.
(T)he underlying purpose of the statute is to distinguish between labor performed in the final assembly of a vehicle
and the value of the parts which go into the vehicle. Including ``in-house'' parts does not do violence to this distinction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA agrees with this comment of the UAW. A failure to consider parts produced at the final assembly plant as ``passenger
motor vehicle equipment'' would result in significant differences among manufacturers. Further, if a plant were
very highly integrated, it could result in a situation where the parts content percentages do not reflect the greater
number of a vehicle's parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, however, NHTSA must give full effect to the Congressional intent to exclude the costs of final assembly
from parts content calculations. The agency believes that the best way to accomplish this is the method suggested
by AAMA: define 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include all operations involved in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point (the final
assembly plant), including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim
installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment
components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining or molding processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, all costs incurred at the final assembly plant are excluded except for those that are incurred
in producing either engines/transmissions or in producing parts using forming processes such as stamping, machining
or molding. In addition to ensuring that final assembly costs are excluded as required by section 210, the agency also
believes that a definition along these lines is much clearer than the proposed definition. For example, this type
of definition will not raise issues concerning whether a part is assembled on the main assembly line or off of it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA cannot accept the recommendation of foreign vehicle manufacturers to define final assembly as starting at
the time when the engine and body are fastened together. Under such a definition, manufacturers could add the engine
to the body as the last step in assembling the vehicle, thereby reducing final assembly costs to a nullity. Such an approach
would be inconsistent with the statutory requirement to exclude assembly and labor costs at the final assembly plant
from parts content calculations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that a similar problem could occur under the proposed definitions for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly point.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As suggested by BMW's comment, manufacturers could tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition.
This could also reduce the costs of final assembly to a value close to a nullity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that the cost of painting the vehicle body is considered to be part of the cost of final assembly under the
definitions being adopted for the final rule, assuming that it occurs at the final assembly plant. While this is a different
result than under the proposed definitions, the agency believes it is appropriate since painting is an operation
that occurs at essentially all final assembly plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that the fact that final assembly labor and other costs are not included in parts content percentages
does not mean that they are not reflected on the label. The origin of these costs is reflected in the portion of the label
which states the final assembly point by city, state and country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Passenger motor vehicle equipment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 210(f)(4) provides that the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means ``any system, subassembly, or component received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on,
or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate
purchaser.'' That section also provides that the term does not include ``minor parts, such as attachment hardware
(nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, etc.) and such other similar items'' as may be prescribed by rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dealer- and port-installed equipment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NHTSA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that dealer- or port-installed optional equipment should be excluded from
content calculations. The agency noted that the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in section 210(f)(4) is limited to equipment delivered to the manufacturer's final assembly point for installation
on, or attachment to, a vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer. NHTSA noted further
that equipment sent directly to dealers or ports is never sent to the manufacturer's final assembly point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford stated that it agrees that dealer- and port-installed items of equipment should be excluded from content calculations
since they do not come within the statutory definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment. That company added,
however, that the agency should reserve the option to address this issue if it appears that any manufacturer is, to
a significant degree, installing options beyond the final assembly point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIADA stated that it strongly supports the tentative conclusion that dealer- or port-installed optional equipment
should be excluded from content calculations. That organization stated, however, that the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be clarified. AIADA argued that while the authors of the Labeling Act may have attempted to exclude port-installed
and dealer-installed parts such as air conditioners, wheels and stereo systems, the words ``for installation on,
or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer'' may not be interpreted
to exclude these parts. AIADA suggested adding the words ``and installed on'' to the definition, i.e., components
received at final assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and installed on
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 such vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that dealer- or port-installed optional equipment should
generally be excluded from content calculations since such equipment is ordinarily not received at the final assembly
point. However, the agency does not agree with AIADA's suggested clarification. That organization appears to be
referring to equipment which is received at the final assembly point and travels with the vehicle to the dealer, where
the final installation is made. NHTSA believes that such equipment does fall within the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
motor vehicle equipment,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 i.e., it is received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle at the
time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate purchaser. The agency views the
fact that the equipment travels with the vehicle as a form of attachment to the vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exclusion of minor parts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency tentatively concluded in the NPRM that all parts received at the final assembly point, including paint,
sealers and solvents, are to be included as ``equipment'' for purposes of the Labeling Act, with the exception of the
minor parts specified in the statute. However, NHTSA encouraged commenters to suggest other specific minor parts
that should be excluded, and to comment on whether paint, sealers and solvents should be included as equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA argued that the exclusions should be broadened. That organization stated that it would prefer the agency to exclude
all items not covered under NAFTA Annex 403.1. AAMA stated that since the agency had elected not to parallel that aspect
of NAFTA, it recommended the following additional exclusions: lubricants, grease, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate
rinse, sealers, windshield washer fluid, auto transmission fluid, anti-freeze, tape, straps, hinge covers, valve
stems, labels, owners manuals, hinges, bulbs, power steering fluid, knobs, bushings, fasteners, decals, isolators,
tire assembly fluid, spacers, clamps, rivets, retainers, deadeners, adhesives, links, springs (except springs
for suspension systems), grommets, wheel weights, fuses, plugs, paint, clear coat, and primer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AAMA stated that the listed components represent less than three percent of material value, but 30&hyph;35 percent
of the number of part numbers in a passenger motor vehicle. That organization argued that the recommended list would
exclude a minimal value from the definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment, while significantly reducing
the number of parts and suppliers that have to be solicited for content information. AAMA also recommended that outside
and allied suppliers be permitted to default the values of these components to the country of origin of the passenger
motor vehicle equipment in which they are incorporated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford stated that items such as paints, sealers and solvents should not be included in the definition of passenger motor
vehicle equipment. That company stated that both bulk parts and raw materials should be excluded from the vehicle
content calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford noted that the Labeling Act defines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as ``a system, sub-assembly or component'' received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment
to, the vehicle. Ford argued that if Congress had intended to add bulk items or items such as paint and solvents or bulk
parts, such as wheel weights and rivets, to the calculation, it would not have used the terms ``system, sub-assembly
or component.'' That company stated that in other sections of the Act, where Congress intended raw and bulk materials
to be included, it used the terms ``foreign content'' or ``material.'' Ford stated that paint, solvents, and sealers
should not be considered systems, sub-assemblies, or components because, among other reasons, these items only
have part numbers when ordered in bulk quantities. That company supported the list of additional exclusions set forth
in AAMA's comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of manufacturers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan supported treating paint, sealers and solvent as
equipment. Honda stated that it believes that NHTSA appropriately defined minor parts to be excluded from the calculation
in the NPRM. Nissan, however, stated that it is not sure whether everything other than attachment hardware can be properly
considered passenger motor vehicle equipment and suggested that NHTSA consider how other regulatory and/or legislative
schemes may determine whether a particular item is an auto part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Isuzu stated that it believes attachment hardware such as nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins and braces must be included
in, rather than excluded from, the definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment.'' That company stated that
the vehicle manufacturer specifies part numbers for these parts. It is not easy to identify these parts on the carline
parts list and then separate them from other parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that it supports including items that become a permanent part of the vehicle such as adhesives, sealers,
and paint. However, that manufacturer recommended that consumable items such as windshield washer and gasoline
not be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APMA stated that it supports the exclusion of paint, sealers and solvents on the grounds that they are almost invariably
of local origin, and their exclusion will reduce the regulatory burden to manufacturers and paint suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UAW stated in its comment on the request for comments that, to avoid undermining the intent of the Labeling Act,
the exclusion for minor parts should be narrowly construed. The UAW stated that it does not believe the definition
should be interpreted to exclude paint or sealer, or raw materials, fasteners, or general purpose hardware. The UAW
stated that many of these items have substantial value, and that excluding them would only serve to provide consumers
with a misleading impression of the domestic versus foreign content of motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the agency has decided to exclude some additional items from the definition of ``motor
vehicle equipment,'' but not the entire list suggested by AAMA. With respect to AAMA's comment that it would prefer
that all items not covered under NAFTA Annex 403.1 be excluded, the agency notes some major items of motor vehicle equipment
are not covered by that annex, including air bags. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use NAFTA Annex 403.1 as
the basis for determining what additional ``minor parts'' should be excluded. NHTSA also notes that it cannot adopt
Isuzu's suggestion to include attachment hardware such as nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins and braces within the
definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment,'' since those items are expressly excluded by the statutory
definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has decided to exclude the following additional items from the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 phosphate rinse, tire assembly fluid, gasoline, oil, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, rivets, grommets, and
wheel weights. The first five items are consumable items which are either consumed in the assembly of the vehicle or
are replaced within the first few days or months of vehicle ownership. Therefore, the agency believes that those items
should not be considered part of the vehicle. The last four items are either forms of attachment hardware similar to
the other ones listed in the statutory definition, or types of items whose collective value for a particular motor
vehicle will always be negligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not adopting the other exclusions suggested by AAMA because the items are not similar to the ones listed
in the statutory definition and because the collective value of the items for a particular motor vehicle can be substantial.
With respect to Ford's comment concerning the meaning of ``system, subassembly, or component,'' the agency believes
that the term ``component'' is sufficiently broad to include such things as paint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the minor items which are excluded from the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
passenger motor vehicle equipment,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the agency is permitting allied and outside suppliers to treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country
of assembly of the equipment. NHTSA notes that this treatment is only necessary to the extent that such minor items
are part of other equipment supplied by a supplier. To the extent that such minor items are supplied directly to a manufacturer,
or are used by a manufacturer in assembly of a vehicle, they are not considered passenger motor vehicle equipment.

which read as follows:

The agency stated in the NPRM that it believed the proposed explanatory note would clarify the meaning of ``parts content''
to consumers, and help them understand the significance of the content information provided on the label. NHTSA noted
that since the percentage of a vehicle's total wholesale cost which is made up of parts content varies for different
vehicles, it believed that it would be appropriate to state the information in a range, e.g., 60 to 70 percent, 70 to
80 percent, etc. Since the agency did not have this information, it requested manufacturers to provide the information
for several specific vehicles, as well as their recommendation for a range to include in a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Use of the term ``parts content.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AAMA objected to the term ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content'' for describing the first item of information on the label.
It argued that the statute specifies use of the term ``U.S./Canadian Content,'' and that the inclusion of the word
``parts'' is contrary to the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA acknowledges that section 210(b)(1)(A) specifies that the information ``be identified with the words `U.S./Canadian
content.''' However, the agency believes the term U.S./Canadian Parts Content is consistent with this statutory
requirement. The statutory language ``U.S./Canadian content'' is included within the term ``U.S./Canadian Parts
Content.'' Consistent with its authority to specify the form and content of the required label, the agency added the
word ``parts'' to indicate to prospective purchasers that the identified U.S./Canadian content is for a vehicle's
parts (within a carline) rather than for the vehicle as a whole. To the extent that AAMA objects to the agency breaking
up the phrase ``U.S./Canadian content,'' NHTSA could instead specify a parenthetical at the end of the term U.S./Canadian
content, such as (parts). However, the agency believes that the term U.S./Canadian Parts Content is preferable since
it is easier to read. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that AAMA also objected to use of the term ``parts'' instead of ``equipment'' in the purpose section of
Part 583. That objection would presumably also apply to the wording on the label. AAMA contended that the calculations
required by the statute are based on the value and content of passenger motor vehicle equipment and not ``parts.''
Since the term ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' includes all parts except minor parts such as attachment hardware,
NHTSA believes that the terms ``equipment'' and ``parts'' are interchangeable. For purposes of the label, the agency
believes that the term ``parts'' is preferable to ``equipment.'' The former term is shorter and therefore takes less
space. Moreover, the agency believes that consumers are more likely to understand the term ``parts.'' While it is
common to refer to a vehicle being made up of parts, one does not ordinarily refer to a vehicle being made up of equipment.
Also, the term ``equipment'' may have the connotation of optional accessories to consumers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Explanatory note. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency received numerous comments on its proposal to require an explanatory note concerning the meaning of parts
content. As discussed below, some commenters argued that no note should be permitted or required; others agreed that
a note should be provided but argued that it should be worded differently. No commenters supported the proposed wording.
Numerous manufacturers argued that the ratio of parts content value to wholesale dealer cost varies so widely among
vehicles that there is no such thing as a ``typical vehicle'' in this context. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA argued against including the explanatory note. It stated that the note is not required by statute and adds a measure
of confusion to the consumer because of the broad range of ratios that exist for vehicles. GM argued that there is no
authority under the Labeling Act for such a note. It stated that the proposed note does not clarify the information
on the label, is an approximation, and includes elemental costs not considered by the Act. Ford stated that if NHTSA
believes that clarification is necessary, it should consider an explanatory brochure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIAM stated that it is opposed to requiring information on the label concerning a parts content percentage range as
it relates to the total wholesale cost to the dealer, as this additional information would only serve to confuse the
consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JAMA, however, argued that it is vital to consumer understanding to clarify the fact that the label calculation does
not include vehicle final assembly labor. That organization stated that the proposed note would clarify this to some
degree, but does not go far enough. It suggested adding the following words to the note: ``and does not include vehicle
final assembly labor.'' JAMA also argued that the note should include an additional statement about assembly labor
for engines and transmissions not being included in country of origin label calculations for those items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota stated that the proposed note would not be helpful because of the necessary broadness of the range and the potential
for additional consumer confusion. That manufacturer also stated that it does not believe a required, industry-wide
explanatory statement is necessary. Toyota indicated, however, that if the agency does require an explanatory statement,
it believes the statement should be one that consumers readily would understand and that would avoid confusion. It
suggested the following statement: ``The U.S./Canada parts content on this label does not include final assembly
or distribution costs for this vehicle.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda supported the idea of an explanatory note, since it believes that consumers are likely to be misled by the label
without it. That company did not support the proposed wording, however, since the language does not clearly tell consumers
that certain specific costs are excluded. Honda also stated that it believes the inclusion of a range of the percentage
of parts costs would be confusing to consumers. Honda suggested the following explanatory note: ``U.S./Canadian
parts content on this label does not include final assembly or distribution costs for this vehicle.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nissan suggested that each manufacturer be allowed, at its discretion, to include or not include additional information
or explanation relevant to that manufacturer or particular carline. It stated that introducing a new percentage
on the label that is calculated from a different base will only add to the consumer's confusion. Nissan stated that
if the agency decides to require a statement, it suggests the following language: ``The parts content percentages
identified here do not value similar parts equally nor reflect the value of final assembly labor or parts or distribution
expenses, all necessary aspects of determining the ultimate value of a vehicle.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIADA stated that it supports the proposal to include a statement on the label to indicate that parts content of a vehicle
does not represent the total value of the vehicle. That organization stated that it believes the statement should
include a mention of what is not included, specifically labor and distribution costs. That organization also argued
that the agency should go further than providing a simple note. It argued that the label should explain such things
as roll-up, roll-down for outside suppliers (roll-up, roll-down is discussed later in this preamble), and whether
or not the vehicle is domestic or import for CAFE purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering all of the comments, and noting that none of the commenters provided information concerning the
range of parts content as a percentage of wholesale cost, NHTSA has decided to require a brief explanatory note to explain
the meaning of parts content. Since consumers are not likely to be familiar with the concept of parts content, the agency
is concerned that they are likely to confuse parts content with overall vehicle content without such a note. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is persuaded by the comments, however, that the note should not provide a range for the ratio of parts content
value to wholesale dealer cost for a typical vehicle. The agency agrees that such a statement might confuse consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has decided to require the following explanatory note at the end of the label: ``Parts content does not include
final assembly, distribution, or other non-parts costs.'' NHTSA believes that the same note should be provided for
all vehicles, to ensure brevity and clarity. With respect to GM's comment concerning authority, the agency notes
that section 210(c) provides the agency with authority to prescribe the form and content of the required label. The
agency also notes that manufacturers choosing the option, discussed earlier in this preamble, of providing additional
information for carlines assembled in both the U.S./Canada and other countries, would be required to include it at
the end of this explanatory note. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Place of final assembly. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Toyota stated that the city of assembly should only be required for vehicles assembled in the U.S. That manufacturer
argued that vehicles assembled in other countries should be labeled only with the country, not city, of final assembly,
since the names of many cities in foreign countries in which automobiles are assembled are likely to be unfamiliar
to many if not most consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that section 210(b)(1)(B) expressly states that the label must indicate ``the final assembly point by
city, State (where appropriate), and country of such automobile.'' Therefore, the agency does not have the discretion
to permit the names of foreign cities to be excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Procedure for Determining U.S./Canadian Parts Content (Section 583.6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM, in order to calculate the percentage U.S./Canadian parts content (the first item of information
on the label), the vehicle manufacturer must know: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the U.S./Canadian content (by value) of each item of motor vehicle equipment used to assemble the vehicles within
the carline; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the total value of each such item of equipment, i.e., the price it will pay for each such item of equipment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the unit volume of each such item of equipment for each carline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated in the NPRM that, in calculating the U.S./Canadian parts content for each carline, the manufacturer
must reasonably project the installation rates for all equipment offered on that carline. For example, if a carline
with a standard manual transmission is offered with an optional automatic transmission, the manufacturer must project
the sales of each transmission in advance of the model year. This also applies to all other equipment options or choices
for the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the information that manufacturers use to calculate the first item on the label must come from parts suppliers.
These calculations are made once for each model year, prior to the model year. As discussed later in this preamble,
the agency is requiring suppliers to provide information to manufacturers concerning the content of the parts they
supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in &sect;583.6 of the proposed regulation for determining U.S./Canadian parts
content. Section 583.6(b) set forth a procedure for determining the value of items of equipment. It provided that
the value of an item of equipment is generally the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment as delivered to the
final assembly point, and that the value of an item of equipment produced at the final assembly plant is the fair market
price that a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 583.6(c) set forth a procedure for determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of equipment. It
set forth different procedures for outside and allied suppliers, to reflect the fact that the statutory ``roll-up,
roll-down'' provision applies to outside suppliers, but not allied suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 583.6(d) set forth a procedure for determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's
passenger motor vehicle equipment. This procedure involved adding up the total value of all of the equipment to be
installed in that carline during the next model year, dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such equipment
by the total value of the equipment, and multiplying the resulting number by 100.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Determining the value of items of equipment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AAMA commented that 583.6(b) puts the valuation emphasis on where material is received as opposed to from whom it is
purchased. That organization stated that for equipment purchased from outside suppliers by either a vehicle manufacturer
or allied supplier, valuation should be based on the price that exists in the financial records at the time the content
is calculated. AAMA stated that for equipment purchased from allied suppliers, valuation should be based on the established
practices of the manufacturer, which could include a transfer cost or transfer price methodology. That organization
stated that if a transfer price is used, the price should be consistent with customs valuation or that used for internal
management. AAMA also noted that &sect;583.6 does not address determination of value for items of equipment delivered
to allied suppliers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA notes that valuation is based on where material is received because section 210(f)(13) provides, with respect
to passenger motor vehicle equipment which is of U.S./Canadian origin, that ``(f)or both outside suppliers and allied
suppliers the value used shall be the purchase price of the passenger motor vehicle equipment as paid at the final assembly
point.'' The agency also notes that section 210(f)(10)(A) provides, with respect to the term ``value added in the
United States and Canada,'' that costs incurred or profits made 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at the final vehicle assembly point and beyond
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 *&blank;*&blank;* shall not be considered in such calculation.'' This implies that all costs up to delivery of the
equipment to the final assembly point are included. NHTSA therefore believes, with respect to motor vehicle equipment
that is delivered to the final assembly point, that the value of the equipment should be the price paid by the manufacturer
for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that a specification that valuation be based on the price that exists in the financial records
at the time the content is calculated would be too vague. It would be unclear, for example, whether the price in question
was for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point. Similarly, a specification that valuation be based
on the established practices of the manufacturer would also be vague.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that it is not possible to value equipment based on the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment
as delivered to the final assembly point, e.g., because the equipment is produced at the final assembly point or a transfer
price methodology is used, the agency believes, for purposes of consistency among manufacturers, that value should
be based on the price that the manufacturer would have paid for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point.
The final rule therefore provides that the value of each such item of equipment is the fair market price that a manufacturer
of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment. NHTSA is also setting forth essentially the same
valuation procedures for equipment delivered to an allied supplier, except that valuation is based on the price paid
for the equipment as delivered to the allied supplier.

b. Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items of equipment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 APMA stated that if NHTSA does not adopt the AIAG model of content calculation, the regulation should specifically
state how outside suppliers should calculate U.S./Canadian content. That organization stated that, in the NPRM,
the agency relied on the definitions of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
value added
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
foreign content
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the statute. APMA stated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
value added
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is defined as the total purchase price (presumably paid by the customer) less the total purchase price (presumably
paid by the supplier) of foreign content. APMA stated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
foreign content
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is simply defined as equipment which is ``not determined to be U.S./Canadian origin.'' That organization stated
that the statute and regulation give no direction as to how this determination is to be made. APMA also stated that while
the agency noted that suppliers ``may need in some cases to arrange to obtain information from their supplier,'' it
did not explain what that information is and how it is to be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APMA stated that the absence of any specific regulatory direction on the way in which outside suppliers are to calculate
``valued added in the U.S./Canada'' is likely to lead to numerous interpretations and challenges. For example, can
suppliers count all costs and profit or are some costs and profits excluded? How will a supplier know with certainty
that an input qualifies as U.S./Canadian content? APMA stated that it believes that adoption of the AIAG content calculation
is the best approach and would have minimal regulatory cost burden. That organization stated that if the agency does
not follow that approach, it suggests adding the following additional definition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the supplier
produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial boundaries
of the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All costs incurred (other than the purchase price of foreign material received at such plant) and all profits made
at such plant shall form part of the value added in the United States and Canada. Foreign material shall be limited to
materials which have been produced or assembled outside of the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada
and which have not undergone any further production or other operation within the territorial boundaries of the United
States or Canada before being received by such supplier or an affiliate of such supplier.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nippondenso America stated that the specified method for calculating U.S./Canadian content should state that value
added in the U.S. and Canada includes profit and processing costs such as labor, depreciation, expenses, etc. (originating
in the U.S. or Canada), to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion regarding determinations of the U.S./Canadian
content.

Nissan stated that the proposed regulation does not address how suppliers should treat duty. Nissan recommended
that suppliers treat duty paid as domestic. It stated that this would be consistent with the treatment of duty under
CAFE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with the commenters that it is appropriate to provide additional clarification in the regulation concerning
how suppliers are to calculate value added in the U.S./Canada. The agency notes that only allied suppliers typically
need to calculate actual value added in the U.S./Canada of their equipment. As a result of the roll-up, roll-down provision,
outside suppliers only need to determine whether the value added in the U.S./Canada is at least 70 percent or not. In
order to make this determination, of course, outside suppliers need to understand how value added in the U.S./Canada
is calculated. Moreover, if the value added in the U.S./Canada of their equipment is close to 70 percent, outside suppliers
will need to calculate actual value added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that APMA's recommendation that the agency adopt the AIAG content calculation procedure as the best
approach for calculating value added in the U.S./Canada is unclear. The AIAG, as an organization, represents an industry
effort to, among other things, help suppliers comply with the Labeling Act. As pointed out by AAMA, however, ``due
to the lack of regulatory guidance, complete process definition has not been established.'' The agency assumes that
AIAG will continue its efforts to help suppliers once today's final rule is issued. Since the AIAG has not completed
the process of establishing a content calculation procedure, NHTSA does not know what APMA means in recommending
that the AIAG procedure be adopted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the comments, the agency has decided to add the following clarifying language to &sect;583.6(c):

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4)(i) Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the
supplier produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial
boundaries of the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or
assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted
from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly plant) of the equipment. Except as provided in (c)(3),
material is considered foreign to whatever extent part or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent
value added in the United States or Canada, traced back to raw materials. For any material which is imported into the
United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the
material originated in the United States or Canada. Neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value
added in the United States or Canada backwards; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to
value added in the United States or Canada is considered foreign. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A supplier located in the United States or Canada uses sheet steel to produce exterior panels which are shipped to a
final assembly plant. In determining the valued added in the United States or Canada of the exterior panels, the supplier
must subtract the price it paid for the sheet steel except to the extent that the supplier determines that the price
paid represents value added in the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the minor items listed in the &sect;583.4 definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being
excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their
equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States
or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of its material originated
in the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States or Canada.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In clarifying how suppliers are to calculate value added in the U.S./Canada, NHTSA believes it is important to keep
in mind the statutory requirement that it adopt regulations that provide the best and most understandable information
possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary
burdens on the manufacturers. In order to make perfect determinations of the value added in the U.S./Canada of all
passenger motor vehicle equipment, it would be necessary to trace all costs involved in producing such equipment,
including the costs of all component parts, all the way back to raw materials. Even if such an effort were possible,
it would be extremely costly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of submissions from GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi and AIAM in response to its request for comments, NHTSA
explained in the NPRM that it agreed with the general premise that tracking and reporting requirements should be limited
to ``first tier'' suppliers (including both suppliers which deliver equipment to the manufacturer itself and ones
which deliver equipment to an allied supplier). The agency stated that no requirements would be imposed on suppliers
earlier in the chain, but noted that suppliers which are subject to the proposed information requirements may need
in some cases to arrange to obtain information from their suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A basic issue raised by APMA's comment is how, in the absence of extensive tracking requirements, ``first tier'' suppliers
will know enough about the content of the materials they purchase from other sources, for incorporation into their
equipment, to make the required determinations about U.S./Canadian content. In fact, the suppliers may not know,
or be able to find out, the amount of the cost of such materials that represents value added in the U.S./Canada. APMA's
comment also raises the issue of how suppliers are to treat such things as costs and profits.

The agency believes that the best way to resolve this potential problem is to specify simple procedures concerning
the determination of value added in the U.S./Canada. NHTSA notes that the total value of an item of passenger motor
vehicle equipment is determined under &sect;583.6(b). The relevant issue, therefore, is what part of that total
value represents value added in the U.S./Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with APMA that the basic way suppliers add value in the U.S./Canada is by producing or assembling passenger
motor vehicle equipment within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada. The simplest method of
determining the value added in the U.S./Canada for equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries
of the United States or Canada is to subtract from the total value of the equipment the value of any foreign materials
used in such production or assembly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarifying procedures therefore specify that, in determining the value added in the United States or Canada of
passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States
or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly
plant) of the equipment. The procedures also specify that material is considered foreign to whatever extent part
or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent value added in the United States or Canada, traced back
to raw materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value added in the United States or
Canada back to raw materials; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to value added in the
United States or Canada is considered foreign. NHTSA believes that this approach is consistent with section 210(f)(16),
which specifies that ``foreign'' or ``foreign content'' mean ``passenger motor vehicle equipment not determined
to be U.S./Canadian origin.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarifying procedures also provide that for any material which is imported into the United States or Canada from
a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the material originated in the
United States or Canada. For purposes of simplicity and consistency, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to deem any
materials which are imported in the United States or Canada from a third country as foreign. The agency believes that
any attempt to separate out the possible portion of such materials that may have originated in the United States or
Canada would involve extremely complex issues concerning how various costs are attributed to different countries.
This would not provide significantly more useful information to the consumer, but would require a much more complicated
regulatory scheme.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that APMA recommended a somewhat different approach with respect to the treatment of foreign material.
Under its suggested provision, foreign material would be limited to materials which have been produced or assembled
outside of the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada and which have not undergone any further production
or other operation within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada before being received by such
supplier or an affiliate of such supplier. The problem with this recommended provision is that the entire value of
foreign material which has undergone further production or other operation within the U.S./Canada would be transformed
into value added in the U.S./Canada. This would create a giant loophole by which foreign material could be transformed
into U.S./Canadian content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above discussion has primarily concerned determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger
motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada.
For equipment which is imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the clarifying regulations
specify that the value added in the United States or Canada is zero. The agency is taking this approach for the same reasons
discussed above with respect to imported material that is used to produce or assemble passenger motor vehicle within
the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarifying regulations also specify that the payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States
or Canada. While it may be necessary to pay duty as a condition of an item crossing a national border, such payment does
not add any value to the item in the country to which duty is paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is also including a provision which specifies that if a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information
from one or more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian
content of that equipment is considered zero. While the agency does not believe that this situation will occur very
often, the provision ensures that U.S./Canadian content is not overstated as a result of the manufacturer or allied
supplier simply assuming that equipment is of U.S./Canadian origin in the absence of information from the supplier.
The provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information from
their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.

c. Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GM stated that the agency had proposed that the proper method to establish the U.S./Canadian content for a carline
is to estimate the installation rates for all equipment options and choices offered on that carline multiplied by
the U.S./Canadian content value for each option or choice divided by the total value for all equipment, domestic or
foreign. That company stated that it has found for cost management and planning purposes that the use of a high volume
configuration carline model results in better management control of the assembly process than the so called average
equipped carline model. GM stated that such a model has found wide acceptance in calculations made for corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) emission testing configurations, and most recently, for vehicle configurations under NAFTA.
That company recommended that the agency permit manufacturers to use established carline cost management models
for establishing the percentage U.S./Canadian content required to be included in the AALA domestic content label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JAMA stated that it understands that it is NHTSA's intention that manufacturers project the sales mix of all of the
potentially many models within a carline, including differences in series, engine type, transmission type, and
other optional equipment, and to perform the weighted average carline calculation based on this model and equipment
mix. That organization stated that it believes this calculation method would impose an unnecessarily great burden
on manufacturers without a significant increase in the accuracy of the computed percentage. It recommended that
agency permit a manufacturer, at its option, to use the U.S./Canadian parts content of a specific model, e.g., the
best selling model of a carline, on a projected sales basis, which is considered to reasonably represent the entire
carline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mazda stated that it believes proposed calculation method would impose too much burden on manufacturers, and recommended
that NHTSA permit manufacturers to use U.S./Canadian parts content of a specific representative model within a carline,
e.g., best selling model, as the parts content of the carline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA does not disagree with the concept of permitting simplified procedures for estimating U.S./Canadian content,
if such procedures would always ensure reliable results. However, the procedures suggested by the commenters, which
are based on either a high volume configuration or best selling model, would not appear to always ensure meaningful
results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, as discussed above, vehicles within a carline may be assembled in both the U.S./Canada and a foreign country.
If the high volume configuration or best selling model was produced in the U.S./Canada and the rest of the carline was
produced in a foreign country, content calculations based on the portion of the carline assembled in the U.S./Canada
would not be representative of the carline as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes it would inappropriate to permit simplified procedures that could produce unreliable results.

4. Procedure for Determining Major Foreign Sources of Passenger Motor Vehicle Equipment (Section 583.7)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM, item two on the label, listing the main foreign sources of a carline's equipment, is necessary
only if one or more foreign countries (i.e., countries other than the U.S./Canada) individually contribute at least
15 percent of the value of the carline's equipment. If there is one such country, the manufacturer must list that country
and the percentage by value that originated in that country for the carline. If there are two such countries, the manufacturer
must list those countries and the percentage by value that originated in those countries for the carline, in descending
order of percentage. Manufacturers need not list more than two such countries. As with the first item on the label,
much of the information that manufacturers need to calculate the information for the second item must come from parts
suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in &sect;583.7 of the proposed regulation for determining major foreign sources
of passenger motor vehicle equipment. The section specified the same procedure for determining the value of items
of equipment as &sect;583.7, and also specified procedures for determining the country of origin of items of equipment
and for determining the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable
to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA noted in the NPRM that the statute does not specify how country of origin is determined for purposes of item two
on the label. The agency tentatively concluded that the simplest method would be to specify one country of origin for
each item of equipment, using the country from which the greatest share of value originated for the item of equipment.
The agency noted that this is the method that Congress prescribed for the only other country of origin calculation
in section 210, i.e., country of origin for engines and transmissions in section 210(f)(12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford commented that due to differences in calculation methods for U.S./Canadian and foreign content, it would be
possible for the sum of the domestic and foreign label values of a vehicle to be either over 100 percent or zero percent,
thereby causing confusion to consumers. That company suggested an alternative method for determining country of
origin which, among other things, would attribute the total value of outside supplied equipment that contains less
than 70 percent value added in the U.S./Canada to the country other than the U.S./Canada which contributed the greatest
amount of value to that item. Ford stated that if the agency did not adopt its recommendation, it should clarify that
the sum of U.S./Canadian content is considered one country, to preclude the classification of an item of equipment
that is more than 50 percent U.S./Canadian to be classified as a foreign item of equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler argued that the proposed regulation could result in an anomaly. It stated, among other things, that under
the proposed method for determining country of origin, the country of origin could be the U.S. or Canada in situations
where U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent. Chrysler recommended an alternative method for determining
foreign country of origin. The method would only consider passenger motor vehicle equipment that contains less than
70 percent valued added in the U.S./Canada, and would consider the foreign value of the equipment to be its value multiplied
by the percent of content that originated outside of the U.S. and Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota stated that a ``greatest share of value originated'' test for purposes of item two on the label would represent
a new and different test that is inconsistent with all other origin tests in use. Toyota stated that it believes that
imposing this test would result in more work for suppliers with no benefit to the consumer. That company stated that
if this test is used at all, it should be confined to instances in which the country of origin of passenger motor vehicle
equipment, as determined for Customs purposes, is unknown and cannot be determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW commented that with regard to foreign parts content calculations and country of origin certification, NHTSA
should incorporate an alternative means to allow manufacturers with existing, substantial business records to
use these records as proof of foreign content to comply with the requirements. That company argued that without such
an alternative, NHTSA would be imposing an unnecessary burden which would be increased further due to language barriers.
BMW stated that it already has a system in place to handle customs duties and preferential treatment of goods with Germany
and the EC jurisdiction which provides information on more than 400,000 active BMW parts. That manufacturer stated
that by using the parts database and by inputting the appropriate parameters for a given group of vehicles, it can receive
information that could be utilized to complete the calculations for the foreign parts content of Item Two on the label.
BMW stated that while the wording of the definition of country of origin for customs purposes does not match the language
in the NPRM verbatim, the practical use of either definition essentially would be the same for calculating the foreign
content of Item Two. BMW acknowledged that circumstances would not be precluded where the country of origin would
be different given the two definitions, but argued that these exceptions will not influence the accuracy of the calculated
percentages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the agency has decided to make changes in &sect;583.7 to prevent the possibility
that the specified U.S./Canadian content and major sources of foreign content for a carline will together exceed
100 percent and to provide greater flexibility concerning determination of country of origin for purposes of item
two of the label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the first two items on the label provide parts content percentages for the U.S./Canada and for
up to two major sources of foreign parts content. For example, a label might indicate the following parts content percentages:
U.S./Canada, 50%; Japan, 20%; and Mexico, 15%. Since the label does not purport to indicate all sources of content,
the percentages are not expected to add up to 100%. However, the agency agrees that consumers would be confused if the
numbers added up to more than 100 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One way to prevent the numbers from adding up to more than 100 percent would be to specify a procedure for determining
country of origin for item two of the label that is more closely tied to the statutory method for determining U.S./Canadian
content. However, such a procedure would necessarily be very complicated, given certain aspects of the procedure
for determining U.S./Canadian content, e.g., the roll-up, roll-down provision for outside suppliers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has therefore decided to simply specify that if the U.S./Canada and major foreign source percentages add
up to more than 100 percent, the foreign source percentages are proportionately reduced to the extent necessary to
bring the percentages down to 100 percent. The U.S./Canada percentage is not changed. The agency believes that this
is the more important of the two items of information for consumers, and the method for determining the U.S./Canada
percentage, unlike the methodology for major foreign source percentages, is explicitly set forth in the statute.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since section 210 provides a specific methodology for determining the U.S./Canada percentage, the &sect;583.7
procedures have the limited purpose of providing a method for calculating the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
remaining
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 percentage is attributable to foreign countries which individually contribute at least 15 percent of the parts content,
and the specific percentage attributable to each such foreign country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that the U.S. and Canada are treated together in determining the U.S./Canada content, the agency agrees with
Ford that they should also be treated together in making determinations under &sect;583.7. Beyond that, however,
NHTSA believes that since the statute does not specify a particular method for making the country of origin determinations
for item two of the label, and given the limited purpose of these determinations, manufacturers should be permitted
greater flexibility. The agency is therefore specifying that, in making country of origin determinations for item
two of the label only, manufacturers may use the greatest share of value approach or any other approach that is used
for customs (U.S. or foreign) purposes, so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all parts and so long as
the U.S. and Canada are treated together. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that regardless of what approach a manufacturer selects for making country of origin determinations
for item two of the label, it will have no effect on the specified U.S./Canadian content of a carline. Assume, for example,
that an outside supplier provides equipment with 65 percent U.S./Canadian content. Under the roll-up, roll-down
provision, the equipment is considered 0 percent U.S./Canadian for item one of the label. Under the greatest share
of value approach and possibly under other approaches, the equipment would be considered U.S./Canadian for item
two of the label. However, this would merely mean that the equipment does not show up in the percentages attributable
to Japan, Germany or some other foreign country in the item two calculations; it would never be reflected as U.S./Canadian
on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA does not agree with the specific approaches recommended by Ford and Chrysler. The agency believes that both
approaches are unnecessarily complicated. The agency also notes that the Ford approach would result in country of
origin determinations being made on a very small percentage of value for items with substantial, but less than 70 percent,
U.S./Canadian content.

5. Procedure for Determining Country of Origin for Engines and Transmissions (Section 583.8) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM, the fourth and fifth items on the label, the countries of origin for the engine and transmission,
are also determined separately for each vehicle, instead of on a carline basis. The information needed to make these
determinations also needs to come from suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 210(f)(12) states that the ``country of origin'' of an engine or transmission is the country that contributed
the greatest percentage of dollar value to the engine or transmission, based upon the purchase price of direct materials
received at the individual engine or transmission plant. It also states that the U.S. and Canada are to be treated separately
for determining the country of origin. Thus, the country of origin might be the U.S. or Canada, but could not be U.S./Canada.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA explained in the NPRM that the term ``direct materials'' is not defined in section 210 of the Cost Savings Act.
The agency referred to similar terms in the CFTA to assist it in defining the term, and tentatively concluded that the
term ``direct materials'' refers to the items (i.e., the materials) that make up the final good (either an engine or
a transmission), but does not include the ``costs'' (i.e., items such as labor) that go into assembling the final good.
Those ``costs'' are not ``materials.'' Further, they are not ``received at the individual engine or transmission
plants.'' (Emphasis added.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA therefore concluded that, in calculating the country of origin for engines and transmissions, the country
to which the engine or transmission is attributed is that country in which the greatest percentage by value was added,
based on the purchase price of all equipment that makes up the completed engine or transmission. In addition, the country
of origin calculation is based on the purchase price an engine or transmission supplier pays for all equipment it receives
at the plant at which the engine or transmission is assembled into a completed unit. Based on the language in section
210(f)(12), costs incurred once the engine or transmission supplier has received the equipment at its engine or transmission
assembly plants (e.g., labor costs, depreciation of equipment, insurance, etc.) are not permitted to be taken into
account for purposes of determining the country of origin of an engine or transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognized that some engine/transmission suppliers may produce their own equipment that is integrated
into the fully-assembled engine/transmission. NHTSA requested comments on whether such ``on-site'' production
should be treated similarly to on-site production at a manufacturer's final assembly point, i.e., by including all
costs related to the production of such components, including labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated that under such an approach, for engine suppliers, production that occurs on-site prior to the point
at which the engine parts are assembled to the engine block would not be considered ``engine assembly,'' and non-parts
costs would be taken into account in determining the value of the engine in order to determine its country of origin.
After that point in the process, assembly and other non-parts costs would be disallowed. For transmission suppliers,
production that occurs on-site prior to the point at which the transmission parts are assembled in the transmission
casing (or transmission housing) would not be considered ``transmission assembly,'' and non-parts costs would
be taken into account in determining the value of the transmission in order to determine its country of origin. Again,
after that point in the process, assembly and other non-parts costs would be disallowed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in &sect;583.8 of the proposed regulation for determining country of origin
for engines and transmissions. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that while the proposed regulatory text did not reflect taking
parts production costs at the engine or transmission plant into account in determining country of origin for the engine
or transmission, the agency might, depending on the comments, adopt such an approach in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Assembly costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AAMA stated that it agrees that the statute provides that determination of country of origin for engine and transmission
does not include the cost of assembling and fabricating the engine or transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota, however, stated that it disagrees with this conclusion. That manufacturer argued that the statute does not
expressly require such exclusion, and the Act's use of the words ``dollar value added'' in the first sentence of section
210(f)(12) connotes that the cost of assembling the engine or transmission is to be included. Toyota stated that it
recognizes that the third sentence in (f)(12) provides that the estimate of value is based on the purchase price of
direct materials, but argued that the sentence does not require that the estimate be based solely on the value of direct
materials. Toyota urged the agency to interpret this section based on what it considers to be the plain meaning of both
of these sentences, under which materials are a component of the value added calculation but not the sole component.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitsubishi argued that exclusion of the cost of labor required to build or assemble engines and transmission is not
consistent with other provisions of the regulations, and the value of labor should therefore be included. That manufacturer
stated that since the term ``direct materials'' is not defined in the AALA, the agency should use its discretion to
interpret the undefined and vague language in a manner that is consistent with the rest of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JAMA also argued that assembly labor for engines and transmission should be included in the country of origin label
calculations. That organization stated that if NHTSA believes that the statute precludes such inclusion, the agency
should provide in the final regulations a clear disclaimer statement to that effect. JAMA stated that this could be
accomplished by adding a sentence to the explanatory note or a parenthetical to the label following the words country
of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA concludes, based on the language in section 210(f)(12), that determination
of country of origin for engine and transmission does not include the cost of assembling and fabricating the engine
or transmission. The agency does not accept Toyota's argument about the first and third sentences of (f)(12). Since
the third sentence expressly provides that ``(t)he estimate of the percentage of dollar value shall be based upon
the purchase price of direct materials as received at the individual engine or transmissions plants of engines of
the same displacement and transmission of the same transmission type,'' it limits the meaning of the term ``value
added'' in the first sentence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also does not agree that significance should be accorded the fact that (f)(12) does not expressly provide
that the estimate must be based solely on the value of direct materials. A basic rule of statutory construction provides
that where a form of conduct, the manner of its performance and operation, and the persons and things to which it refers
are designated, there is an inference that all omissions should be understood as exclusions. See Sutherland Stat
Const &sect;47.23 (5th Ed). Since (f)(12) provides that the estimate is to be based on the value of direct materials
received at the individual engine or transmission plant, other items such as assembly costs are excluded in making
estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with Mitsubishi's argument that exclusion of the cost of labor is inconsistent with the rest of the
regulation. The agency notes that &sect;583.8 applies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the determination of country of origin for engines/transmissions for purposes of items four and five on the label;
the cost of labor in assembling engines and transmissions is not excluded for purposes of determining U.S./Canadian
parts content and major foreign sources of foreign content (items one and two of the label). NHTSA also notes that the
exclusion of labor and assembly costs in determining the country of origin for engines/transmissions is directly
analogous to the exclusion of final assembly costs in determining U.S./Canadian parts content and major foreign
sources of content. The agency also disagrees that the term ``direct materials'' is so vague that it can be interpreted
to include labor in assembling the equipment received at engine/transmission plants into engines/transmissions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has, however, decided to specify the addition of the word ``parts'' after ``engine'' and ``transmission''
on the label. The agency believes that this will make it clear to consumers that these country of origin determinations
exclude assembly costs. Because this change involves adding only two words to the label, it will not result in an information
overload for consumers or an unnecessarily long label. NHTSA believes that this change is consistent with the statutory
directive that the regulations provide to the ultimate purchaser of new passenger motor vehicles the best and most
understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles
without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on manufacturers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Parts that are produced at engine and transmission plants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AAMA recommended that the regulation provide that ``(a)ll value added at the transmission and engine plant is excluded
from the calculation of origin.'' APMA stated that the agency asked whether it should include non-parts costs of on-site
production prior to the point at which engine parts are assembled to engine block or transmission parts are assembled
in the transmission casing. APMA stated that it supports the regulation as drafted, which does not include non-parts
costs for on-site production, as being the only approach consistent with the statutory language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of other commenters, however, urged that ``on-site'' production of parts at an engine/transmission plant
should be treated similarly to on-site production at a manufacturer's final assembly point, i.e., by including all
costs related to the production of such components, including labor. Honda stated that it strongly supports inclusion
of costs of in-house production of parts and subcomponents that are subsequently integrated into the engine or transmission
during final assembly. It also stated that the agency's proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
final assembly point
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the engine (the point at which the engine parts are assembled to the engine block) and the transmission (the point
at which the transmission part are assembled in the transmission casing or housing) seems appropriate.

Nissan stated that it agrees that in-house parts and components production should be included as parts content in

should be designated to begin at the point in the production process when the block and head are joined, and that for
transmissions, final assembly should be designated to begin at the point in the production process at which transmission
parts are assembled in the transmission casing.

Toyota stated that because an assembled engine block is not equivalent to an engine (for any piston engine, gasoline
or diesel, there must also be a cylinder head), it recommends that the point of engine assembly should occur no sooner
than the point at which the block and head are attached to one another. That commenter stated that assembly labor prior
to the attachment of the head to the block should not be excluded, as such labor constitutes, by definition, part of
the value of the individual engine block and cylinder head, neither of which by itself constitutes an engine.

BMW stated that it supports treating on-site production of engine and transmission parts in a similar manner to on-site
production of parts at a manufacturer's final assembly plant. BMW added, however, that it believes the definitions
for the starting points of final assembly for the engine and transmission need to be precise so that substantial variances
cannot be achieved by modifying the assembly sequence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that production of parts at an engine or transmission plant should
be treated in a similar manner with respect to determining country of origin of the engine or transmission as the production
of parts at a final assembly plant is treated with respect to determination of a vehicle's parts content. The agency
notes that the basic value of an engine or transmission is not primarily related to either the costs of assembly or the
costs of the raw materials, but is instead related to the costs of producing parts. If an engine or transmission plant
was highly integrated and all parts were produced at the plant, a determination of country of origin that did not reflect
the costs of producing parts would be based entirely on the costs of raw materials. The agency believes that such a determination
would be of little meaning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, however, the agency must give full effect to the congressional intent to exclude the costs of assembling
engines and transmissions. NHTSA believes that the best way to accomplish this is to specify that all value added at
the transmission and engine plant is excluded from the calculation of origin, with the exception of the costs of producing
individual parts of the transmission/engine. Individual parts refers to the most basic level of parts used to assemble
an engine or transmission and not subassemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to ensuring that engine and transmission assembly costs are excluded as required by section 210, the agency
also believes that this approach is much clearer than the specific one discussed in the NPRM preamble. The agency believes
it could be difficult or impossible to define the starting points of final assembly for the engine and transmission
in ways that are appropriate for all manufacturers. NHTSA is particularly concerned that, under such an approach,
manufacturers might be able to modify the assembly process in ways that would reduce the costs of assembling the engine/transmission
to a nullity. This would be possible, for example, under the approach suggested by Toyota. Such a result would be inconsistent
with the statutory requirement that engine and transmission origin determinations be made based on the costs of direct
materials.

c. Other issues concerning determining country of origin for engines and transmissions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AAMA stated that &sect;583.8 refers to determining country of origin for each individual engine and transmission.
That organization stated that this is inconsistent with section 210(f)(10)(B) of the statute, which specifies that
the following groupings are used in determining the origin and value added of engines/transmissions: engines of
the same displacement produced at the same plant and transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant. AAMA
noted that neither the statute nor proposed regulation defines ``type'' of transmission. It suggested that transmission
type be defined as follows: In determining the origin of transmissions produced in the same plant, a type should have
the same characteristics: driveline, number of forward gears, controls, and layout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also commented that the regulation should specify that country of origin is determined once a model year using
same methodology as vehicles, except United States and Canada are treated separately. That organization also stated
that the regulation should make it clear that calculation of origin of engine/transmission is different for determining
overall U.S./Canadian content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that the proposed regulation does not address the appropriate groupings of engines and transmissions
for purposes of calculating country of origin. It also noted that the proposed regulatory text refers to a separate
country of origin determination for each individual engine and transmission, and argued that this is not contemplated
by the Labeling Act and would be extremely burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that it believes the statutory groupings in some cases may be broader than appropriate to give meaningful
information to consumers. It cited the example of an engine that is available in two types, both of same displacement
and both manufactured at same plant, one of which is supercharged and the other standard. Honda stated that the two
engines may have very different parts sources. Honda suggested that final rule provide manufacturers discretion
to make country of origin determinations for engine and transmission subgroupings within the statutory grouping
framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with the commenters that section 210 requires country of origin determinations for engines and transmissions,
for items four and five of the label, to be based on groups of engines. The agency also agrees with AAMA's suggested definition
for transmission type. For purposes of consistency and clarity, the agency believes it is more appropriate to provide
a definition than simply leave subgroupings to the discretion of the manufacturer. The final rule reflects these
changes. The agency does not agree that it is appropriate to permit subgroupings of engines below the level specified
in section 210, since the statute specifies the groups to be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the procedure for determining country of origin for engines and transmissions (for purposes of items four
and five of the label only), the agency is specifying a similar procedure for determining country of origin of the components
that comprise the engine/transmission as for making country of origin determinations for item two of the label, i.e.,
manufacturers may use the greatest share of value approach or any other approach that is used for customs (U.S. or foreign)
purposes, so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all parts. The U.S. and Canada, however, are treated
separately for making these determinations.

Since the statute does not specify a particular method for making country of origin determinations for the components
comprising an engine/transmission, NHTSA believes that this approach will provide appropriate flexibility. The
agency notes that after country of origin determinations are made for each component comprising an engine/transmission,
the ``greatest share of value added'' approach is used to determine the origin of the engine/transmission. The agency
also notes that this approach will not have any effect on item one of the label.

NHTSA proposed to require that the label be placed in a prominent location on each vehicle where it can be read from the
exterior of the vehicle. The agency proposed three options for the format of the label: (1) A stand-alone label that
is at least 5 inches wide by 3 inches long, (2) an addition at the end of the Monroney pricing label (15 U.S.C. 1232), or
(3) an addition at the end of the fuel economy label (15 U.S.C. 2006). Under all three options, the label would be required
to read as follows:

In addition, the label would include the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' at the top, and an explanatory note
at the bottom. The second item of the label (i.e., ``Major Source of Foreign parts Content'') would be omitted if no
individual country other than the U.S./Canada contributed a minimum of 15 percent of the value of a vehicle's equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA stated in the NPRM that to ease comparisons among various carlines and to make the information available to consumers
in as clear and consistent a manner as possible, it believed it was appropriate to specify minimum requirements for
label and letter size. The agency noted that the label, whether separate or attached to the price or fuel economy labels,
must be large enough for all the content information to be easily read, yet small enough to avoid cluttering the limited
window space on the vehicle. The agency proposed to require a separate label to be rectangular with a minimum dimension
of 5.0 inches (125 mm) in width and 3.0 inches (75 mm) in length. The characters for items one through five of the parts
content label would be required to be printed at a minimum height of 12 points (one-sixth of an inch) in boldface type.
The required explanatory note at the bottom of the label would be required to be printed in characters two points smaller
than the information for items one through five. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the information required by section 210 is attached to the price or fuel economy labels, the information would be
required to be separated from the information required to be on those labels by a line that is a minimum of 3 points wide.
The words ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' would be required to be printed in bold, uppercase letters, centered, and
in not less than 12 point type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA stated that the agency should permit the label information on any prominently displayed window label. That organization
stated that as various government agencies add more labeling requirements, many companies have been developing
consumer labels containing information on several different issues. On the issue of format, AAMA stated that because
of increasing labeling requirements such as bumper standards and CFC content, deviations should be permitted with
the prior approval of the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM stated that label space is at a premium, especially for labels which are required to be left in place until delivery.
That manufacturer stated that the information required on the label is specifically set out in the legislation, and
additional information should not be required. GM also argued that the label location, format, size, appearance
and type style should be discretionary with the manufacturer to give the manufacturer the greatest flexibility.
GM indicated that it intends to include this label information in a consumer information label combining several
consumer notices on one label, including such things as bumper system performance information. GM stated that the
regulation should allow consolidation of this label with other consumer notices as part of another window label displayed
for consumer review at time of sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM stated that in its combined consumer information label format, a title size of 12 points with the label information
printed in characters two points smaller would make the label consistent with the other information. That manufacturer
argued that in no case should the type size be larger than 12 points. GM stated that type size changes and bolding are
more practical for implementing emphasis than underlining. According to GM, to maximize use of label space, the format
should be discretionary, not mandated. That company stated, for example, that various information should be allowed
on the same line if width permits to save label space. GM also argued that the title line should be ``Content Information''
to comply with the disclosure intent of the Labeling Act.

Toyota stated that a separate Labeling Act label should not be required to be placed on the same window as the Monroney
label. That company stated that section 210(b) does not require such placement and provides only that the label appear
in a prominent place. Toyota also stated that the proposed 3 x 5 inch minimum size requirement for a separate label would
pose problems concerning placement on some vehicles for which available space is limited. It noted that a manufacturer
choosing to place the information on the Monroney label will be able to devote less space to Labeling Act disclosures
than the 15 square inches of a 3 x 5 inch label. Toyota stated that for the sake of consistency, a separate label should
not have to be substantially larger than the available space on the Monroney label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NADA urged the agency to allow manufacturers to set out parts content information in the certification label required
by 49 CFR part 567. That organization argued that a vehicle's right door frame is a prominent place and that nothing
in the Act requires parts content labels to be affixed to vehicle exteriors. NADA also stated permanent attachment
would provide information to subsequent purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NADA stated that the agency should prohibit the affixing of any separate parts content labels on the vehicle window.
That organization stated that new vehicle windows are already cluttered with the Monroney and fuel economy labels.
It also stated that vehicles in demonstrator service must also have used car rule warranty labels affixed. NADA stated
that, by law, only used car rule labels may be removed during test drives. It noted that many state laws regulate vehicle
window obstruction, but Federal law requires Monroney and fuel economy labels to be maintained. NADA stated that
the agency, consistent with its primary mission to ensure vehicle safety, must not exacerbate this concern by allowing
the potential for an additional window label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to require the label to be placed in a prominent location on each
vehicle where it can be read from the exterior of the vehicle with the doors closed. NHTSA does not accept NADA's recommendation
to permit the label to be included as part of the certification label on the door frame. The agency disagrees that the
door frame would be a prominent location for a consumer information label, since prospective purchasers would need
to open the door of a vehicle, and probably have to stoop down as well, to read the label.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA does not believe that it would be appropriate to prohibit stand-alone labels from being affixed to vehicle windows.
Section 210 expressly provides that the agency must permit manufacturers to use, among other options, a readily visible
separate label. A window location is the most practicable location for consumer information labels since a label
installed on the inside of the glass can be read from outside the vehicle, yet is also protected from the elements. In
addition, affixing labels to exterior painted surfaces could damage the paint. While NHTSA recognizes the importance
of driver visibility, it observes that since a stand-alone label would be very small, such a label could be placed in
an area where it would have little or no impact on visibility. The agency notes, in response to Toyota's comment, that
stand-alone labels are not required to be on the same window as the Monroney label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is adopting format requirements that are similar to those in the NPRM, but with some minor changes. The agency
is requiring the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' for all labels. The agency notes that the NPRM preamble suggested
that the heading would only be required for content labels included as part of other labels. However, the agency believes
that a heading is useful for all labels, since it draws attention to the information and identifies its purpose. The
agency believes the word ``parts'' is appropriate for reasons discussed earlier in this preamble. NHTSA also notes
that the wording of the explanatory note has also been changed and the word ``parts'' has been added after ``engine''
and ``transmission,'' for reasons discussed earlier in the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees that manufacturers should be permitted to include the content label as part of any larger labels meeting
the specified location requirements, since this increases manufacturer flexibility without lessening the usefulness
or visibility of the content information. The agency disagrees, however, that it should drop all of the proposed format
and size requirements. Without such requirements, manufacturers might use fine print that is not easily read. Similarly,
the agency believes that the label would be harder to read if multiple items of information were placed on the same line.
NHTSA is not adopting the proposed requirement that certain information be underlined, since it agrees that the use
of capital letters and bold type provides sufficient emphasis. The agency is adopting minimum type size requirements.
The agency is not adopting any overall size requirement for a separate label, since it believes that the minimum type
size requirements are sufficient to ensure that the content label will be visible and easily read.

NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to affix the content label to each new vehicle before the vehicle is shipped
from the final assembly point to the dealer, shipping agent, or importer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virtually all of the vehicle manufacturers requested more flexibility as to when the label must be affixed to the vehicle,
and relied on the same basic arguments. They noted that section 210(b) does not expressly require manufacturers to
attach the label but instead specifies that each manufacturer shall ``cause to be affixed'' the required label. The
manufacturers also noted that section 210(c) specifies that manufacturers must be permitted the option of including
the content information as part of the Monroney or fuel economy label, and indicated that, for imported vehicles,
these labels are ordinarily affixed at the port of entry, a distribution center or the dealership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the manufacturers requested that the label be required to be affixed prior to the delivery of a vehicle to the
dealership. AAMA requested that the label be required to be affixed prior to a motor vehicle being ``offered for sale
to an ultimate purchaser.'' Ford commented that some vehicles which are shipped to dealers prior to introduction
dates are only consigned to the dealer, and the dealer does not take possession until the vehicle is invoiced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to an inquiry from NHTSA concerning when Monroney labels are affixed, the Justice Department noted that
manufacturers are required by statute, ``prior to the delivery of any new automobile to any dealer, or at or prior to
the introduction date of new models delivered to a dealer prior to such introduction date'' to affix the Monroney label.
That Department noted that the language requiring the Monroney label be affixed ``prior to the delivery'' is straightforward
and places the responsibility squarely on the manufacturer. With respect to the ``introduction date'' exception,
however, the Justice Department indicated that models are introduced at varying times and vehicles may sometimes
arrive at a dealership several months ahead of the ``introduction date'' minus the Monroney labels. The Department
stated that this makes compliance problematic at times and raises enforcement issues that NHTSA may wish to consider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to generally require labels to be affixed prior to the delivery
of a vehicle to the dealer, but to provide an exception for vehicles delivered to dealerships prior to introduction
dates. The agency believes it is desirable for labels to be present on vehicles when they are delivered to the dealership,
since consumers may see such vehicles at any time after such delivery. There is no reason to require the labels to be
affixed any earlier, such as at the final assembly plant, since consumers will not see the vehicles prior to their arrival
at the dealership. Since the Labeling Act provides that manufacturers may include the content information as part
of the Monroney label, the agency believes it is appropriate to provide the same ``introduction date'' exception
as is provided for Monroney labels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, much of the information that manufacturers need to calculate the required items for the label
must come from suppliers. Section 210(d) specifies that the agency must issue regulations which include provisions
applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether equipment provided by such
suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign and to provide such other information as may be necessary to
enable the manufacturer to reasonably comply with the provisions of section 210 and to rely on such certification
and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA proposed specific requirements for suppliers. In order to enable manufacturers to calculate the information
required for items one and two of the label, i.e., the percentage U.S./Canadian content and major foreign sources
of equipment, NHTSA proposed (&sect;583.10) to require outside suppliers to provide the following information
for any equipment they supply to a vehicle manufacturer or to an allied supplier:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer or allied supplier;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) For any equipment for which the U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent, the country of origin for the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency proposed (&sect;583.11) to require allied suppliers to provide the following information for any equipment
they supply to a vehicle manufacturer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The country of origin of the equipment, i.e., the country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using purchase
price), of value was added to the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, both outside and allied suppliers that directly supply vehicle manufacturers would be required
to provide the specified information directly to the vehicle manufacturer, accompanied by a certification of the
information's accuracy. Outside suppliers that directly supply allied suppliers would be required to provide the
specified information and certification directly to the allied supplier. Suppliers would also be required to maintain
records of the information used to determine the information provided to the manufacturers or allied suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency noted in the NPRM that since the information required for items one and two of the label must be calculated
before the beginning of the model year, it is important that manufacturers and outside suppliers receive the required
information in a timely manner. NHTSA proposed to require suppliers to provide the information by specified dates,
based on typical model year production periods. The agency also proposed to require suppliers to base the information
they provide on what they expect to supply during specified production periods. However, recognizing that manufacturers
may establish different model year production periods for particular carlines, the agency proposed to permit manufacturers
and suppliers to conclude agreements specifying alternative production periods and alternative times for providing
the information to the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the information for items four and five of the label, i.e., countries of origin for the engine and
transmission, is calculated for individual vehicles rather than on a carline basis. Under the agency's proposal
(&sect;583.12), suppliers of engines and transmissions would be required to provide the vehicle manufacturer with
the country of origin for each engine or transmission it supplies to the manufacturer, i.e., the country in which the
greatest percentage, by value (using the total cost of equipment to the engine or transmission supplier), was added
to the engine or transmission. The agency proposed to require this information to be provided no later than the time
the engine or transmission is delivered to the manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received numerous comments concerning the proposed requirements for suppliers. AAMA noted that the proposed
regulation would require outside suppliers to provide a manufacturer or allied supplier content information for
each unique type of equipment. It stated that the requirement should be limited to providing content data on those
items of equipment requested by a manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also noted that the proposed regulation would require suppliers' best estimates of price, content and origin
for unique type of equipment expected to be supplied during a 12-month period. That organization stated that it believes
it is highly unlikely that suppliers would be willing or able to release estimates ``for future model year costs,''
as this information is confidential business information and suppliers may not be able anticipate changes that may
be required to contract price during the year due to unforeseen design changes. AAMA suggested that to ease this potential
point of friction between suppliers and manufacturers, it recommends that suppliers' best estimates of price, content
and origin be based on the price which exists in the financial records of the manufacturer at the time when the content
is calculated. That organization stated that if this information does not yet exist because the part is new, suppliers
should be required to provide their best estimates of what the price, content or country of origin will be at start of
production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also stated that the proposed requirements would not provide manufacturers the data necessary to determine
engine and transmission country of origin because they do not specify separate (as well as combined) U.S. and Canadian
content for transmission and engine items of equipment. Information on a combined basis is needed for items one and
two of the label; information on a separate basis is needed for items four and five of the label. Ford stated that since
it is not always known if an item of equipment is going to be installed on an engine or transmission, and to reduce complexity,
the separate and combined U.S. and Canadian content data should be obtained for all items of equipment. That manufacturer
stated that this would also permit the basic information collected from suppliers to support Labeling Act requirements
to be used for other reporting and analysis purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of manufacturers argued that because carlines are not introduced on a rigid schedule, it would be difficult
or impossible for suppliers to adhere to the proposed timing schedule. AAMA stated that suppliers and manufacturers
should be allowed flexibility to establish their own internal guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissan stated that since vehicle model changeovers may occur at varying times throughout the year, it urges NHTSA
to specify that supplier content reporting requirement dates be negotiated by contract among suppliers and manufacturers
rather than a date prescribed by regulations. BMW stated that it believes exact dates for suppliers should be left
to agreements between the manufacturers and suppliers and, therefore, not included in the regulation. That company
noted that the manufacturer has ultimate responsibility to provide a label on the vehicle. BMW stated that the manufacturer
will require from its suppliers that information is received in a timely manner because without the information the
vehicle cannot be sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other vehicle manufacturers, including Toyota and Honda, also emphasized the need for manufacturer flexibility
but stated that the agency's proposal to permit manufacturers and suppliers to conclude agreements specifying alternative
production periods and alternative times for providing the information to the manufacturer would provide the needed
flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APMA stated that if NHTSA adopts the AIAG format, requisite reporting would be jointly submitted by the outside supplier
to the allied supplier or manufacturer. That organization stated that if the AIAG format is not adopted, it recommends
(1) that a common reporting date be used for reporting to both allied suppliers and manufacturers, and (2) that an outside
supplier's obligation to report be conditioned on the receipt of at least 90 days advance written notice from an allied
supplier or manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the issue of supplier certifications, AAMA stated that since allied suppliers are wholly owned by the manufacturer,
the manufacturer has control over the information as well as the timing required from suppliers. It stated that the
information required of allied suppliers should be the same as for outside suppliers, but the certificate should
be optional.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Toyota stated that it believes that ``blanket certifications'' should be authorized for use where a supplier's parts
contain no U.S./Canadian content and where the country of origin of the equipment is indicated in ordinary business
records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments concerning requirements for suppliers, NHTSA has decided to specify specific requirements
concerning the information suppliers must provide manufacturers and allied suppliers, but with some changes from
the proposal. First, the agency is persuaded by AAMA's comment that suppliers should only be required to provide content
data on those items of equipment requested by a manufacturer or its allied supplier. NHTSA is therefore specifying
that manufacturers must request the specified information from their suppliers for relevant motor vehicle equipment,
and that the suppliers must provide the specified information in response to such request (or a request from an allied
supplier). The agency believes that this approach offers two primary advantages: (1) Suppliers will not be required
to provide unnecessary information, i.e., information that would not be used for parts content calculations, and
(2) suppliers are less likely to have compliance problems from not knowing about the requirements of 49 CFR part 583
than in a situation where they did not receive a specific request for the required information. NHTSA also believes
that, as a practical matter, manufacturers would in any event need to be contacting suppliers concerning such things
as where to send the required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is also persuaded that it is unnecessary to specify any specific calendar dates for suppliers to provide the
information. The agency is simply specifying that manufacturers must request the information in time to enable them
to calculate the information required on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency believes that it is generally appropriate to permit manufacturers and suppliers to work out timing
and other details among themselves, it believes that a few simple requirements are necessary for the benefit of outside
suppliers. Specifically, the agency is specifying the following requirements with respect to manufacturer and
allied supplier requests for content information from outside suppliers: (1) The requester must indicate that the
request is being made pursuant to 49 CFR part 583, and that the regulation is administered by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, (2) the requester must indicate that 49 CFR part 583 requires outside suppliers to provide
specified information upon the request of a manufacturer or allied supplier to which it supplies passenger motor
vehicle equipment and that, to the best of the requester's knowledge, the outside supplier is required to provide
the requested information, (3) if any information other than that required by 49 CFR part 583 is requested, the requester
must indicate which information is required by 49 CFR part 583 and which is not, and (4) the requester must indicate
that 49 CFR part 583 specifies that while information may be requested by an earlier date, the outside supplier is not
required to provide the information until the date specified by the requester or the date 45 days after receipt of the
request, whichever is later. The agency is not specifying the specific language by which requesters must provide
this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since compliance by an outside supplier with 49 CFR part 583 is based upon providing information in response to a request
from a manufacturer or allied supplier, the agency believes these requirements are necessary to protect outside
suppliers. The requirements ensure that an outside supplier is aware that it is required by Federal regulation to
provide the requested information, and that it knows the citation for the regulation and the agency which administers
it. The requirements also ensure that outside suppliers will, in the event they receive requests for more information
than that required by 49 CFR part 583, know which information is required by the regulation and which is not. Finally,
the requirements ensure that outside suppliers will have adequate time to respond to the request. NHTSA notes that
APMA recommended that the regulation specify notice of at least 90 days. However, that organization did not justify
that amount of time. The agency believes that 45 days provides ample time, since today's final rule puts outside suppliers
on notice that, from now on, they must provide the specified content information in response to requests from manufacturers
and allied suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that similar requirements are unnecessary to protect allied suppliers, given that allied suppliers
are wholly owned by vehicle manufacturers. Also, any specific timing requirements as to when allied suppliers must
provide requested information would be more complicated, since allied suppliers may need to request information
of outside suppliers in order to provide the requested information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to AAMA's comment that certifications should be optional for allied suppliers, NHTSA notes that section
210(d) specifies that regulations ``shall include provisions applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require
such suppliers to certify whether a component provided by such suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign
* * *.'' Therefore, the agency does not have the discretion to make certifications optional. NHTSA also observes that
while allied suppliers are owned by manufacturers, they are nonetheless separate entities with independent legal
obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given this statutory provision, the agency also cannot permit the use of ordinary business records instead of specific
certifications from suppliers, as recommended by Toyota. The agency notes, however, that a certification can cover
multiple items of equipment and can be part of documents containing other information. Suppliers may be able to incorporate
the certification into other business records that they provide manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not accept AAMA's suggestion that supplier estimates of price, content and origin for unique type
of equipment not be based on a period of time generally corresponding to the model year for which content calculations
are to be made. Estimates that are based on current production or on the start of production might be very different
from what the supplier anticipates for the model year as a whole. For example, a supplier might plan to manufacture
a part in both the United States and overseas, and to begin production in one place slightly before the other place.
In such an instance, an estimate based on start of production would not be meaningful. In order to ensure meaningful
label information, NHTSA believes that estimates must be for an overall production period that corresponds to the
relevant model year. The agency emphasizes, however, that suppliers are only required to provide good faith estimates
and are not prevented from making subsequent changes in price, content and origin for their equipment.

The final rule clarifies that suppliers are required to provide both separate and combined information concerning
the U.S. and Canadian content of parts that may be used in engines or transmissions. With respect to Ford's suggestion
that separate U.S. and Canadian content information be required for all equipment, NHTSA notes that it would be inappropriate
for the regulation to require suppliers to provide information that is not relevant to Labeling Act requirements.
However, manufacturers are free to request suppliers to provide such information outside the context of 49 CFR part
583. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Requirements for Dealers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to require dealers to maintain the label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold to a consumer. The
agency noted in the NPRM that AIADA had submitted a comment on the request for comments arguing that dealers should
be permitted to remove the label from a vehicle if state law requires it, such as when dealers are operating demonstrator
vehicles, or when dealers move cars in an intra-dealer exchange. AIADA had also recommended that dealers be permitted
to affix duplicate labels in the event that the manufacturer-supplied label becomes torn or otherwise mutilated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA addressed this issue as follows in the NPRM: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has tentatively concluded that dealers should not be permitted to remove the label for any reason before sale
to a consumer. The agency believes that it is appropriate to treat this label in same manner as Monroney and fuel economy
labels, since all three labels are intended to provide information to aid consumers in making their purchase decision.
Neither the EPA or Department of Justice permit dealers to remove fuel economy or Monroney labels, even temporarily,
prior to sale to a consumer. The Department of Justice has advised that neither the Monroney nor fuel economy labeling
statutes contain exceptions for situations in which labels purportedly constitute safety hazards in demonstrator
cars (i.e., those cars that dealers allow potential customers to test drive), and went on to state that it was unaware
of any judicial interpretations that would create such exceptions. Section 210 is similar to the other two labeling
statutes in that it does not grant NHTSA the authority to permit dealers to remove the label. Indeed, section 210(b)(1)
states explicitly that each dealer shall cause the label required by this Act to be maintained on the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is also concerned that, if dealers were permitted to remove labels for demonstrator vehicles, consumers would
not have the labeling information available to them at a crucial time in their purchasing decision, i.e., the time
they were evaluating a vehicle for purchase. In addition, the labels might be re-attached inadvertently to the wrong
vehicle or not re-attached at all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice has advised that most manufacturers have been applying Monroney and fuel economy labels
to the rear left windows of vehicles, and affixing the vehicles with labels that do not easily tear or loosen from the
windows to which they are attached. Such placement does not ordinarily interfere with the driver's vision in the event
of a test drive or other similar purpose. Additionally, the dealer could not easily remove the label, even for temporary
purposes, without tearing or destroying it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA will not, therefore, propose to permit dealers to remove labels for any reason prior to a first sale to a consumer,
with one exception: the agency agrees with the AIADA that it is necessary for dealers to replace any label that becomes
mutilated or otherwise damaged prior to sale to a consumer so that the information is no longer legible. 58 FR 61053.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed earlier in this preamble, NADA argued that existing labels including the Monroney and fuel economy labels
create safety concerns for vehicles which are test driven prior to their delivery to first purchasers, because the
labels obstruct visibility. Noting that the agency indicated in the NPRM that dealers would not be allowed to remove
a parts content label except in the event that it becomes mutilated or damaged, that organization urged the agency
to prohibit the placement of separate parts content labels on vehicle windows. NADA stated that the final rule should
specify that dealers may remove labels prior to sale when instructed by a manufacturer to replace them with substitutes
containing updated or corrected information. AIADA repeated its earlier argument that dealers should be permitted
to remove the label from a vehicle if state law requires it, such as when dealers are operating demonstrator vehicles,
or when dealers move cars in an intra-dealer exchange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that there is no basis to change its view, discussed in the NPRM,
that section 210 prohibits temporary removal of labels for test drives. The Justice Department concurs in this view.
Section 210 specifically requires each dealer to ``cause to be maintained, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on each such vehicle
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' the required label. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the required label must be maintained by dealers ``on each *&blank;*&blank;*
vehicle.'' Moreover, the similarity of the language in section 210 for the content label with that for the Monroney
and fuel economy labels indicates that the same result should be obtained. The commenters did not present any legal
analysis challenging the legal analysis presented in the NPRM or suggesting that the Justice Department analysis
is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule does clarify that dealers may replace labels with substitutes containing corrected information when
instructed to do so by a manufacturer. It is unnecessary to specify that labels may be replaced for updated information,
since the information specified on the label is not subject to change (except for purposes of correction).

F. Authority To Exclude Vehicles With Low or High U.S./Canadian Content
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA stated in the NPRM that, for vehicles with less than 35 percent U.S./Canadian content, it was considering providing
manufacturers with the option of simply stating that the percentage U.S./Canadian content is ``minimal'' instead
of determining and providing the precise amount of such content. The agency addressed this issue as follows in the
NPRM: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Several manufacturers requested more limited labeling requirements for manufacturers of new passenger motor vehicles
that contain minimal U.S./Canadian content. In effect, the label would state that the vehicle contained less than
a certain percentage of U.S./Canadian content. It would also state the final assembly point, and the country of origin
of the engine and transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volvo suggested the simplified procedure be implemented for imported vehicles containing under 15 percent U.S./Canadian
content. The AAMA agreed with the 15 percent level, stating that Congress appeared to indicate that higher percentages
of U.S./Canadian content were significant for purposes of labeling. Volkswagen and the AIAM, however, suggested
a level of 35 percent, stating that lower levels would not affect enough vehicles to make implementation of the special
provisions worthwhile. Lamborghini, in its testimony at the public meeting in December 1992, suggested a cutoff
of 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a practical matter, NHTSA agrees that once the domestic content gets below a certain point, the precise amount of
that content becomes immaterial, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
., the vehicle is foreign and small differences in domestic content are not likely to be relevant to consumer purchasing
decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for vehicles with less than 35 percent U.S./Canadian content, the agency is considering providing manufacturers
with the option of simply stating that the percentage U.S./Canadian content is ``minimal'' instead of determining
and providing the precise amount of such content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary benefit of this option would be to eliminate manufacturer costs associated with keeping precise records
and making precise calculations about the U.S./Canadian content of a vehicle, when the manufacturer knows such content
is very low. Under this option, manufacturers would still be required to provide items 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the label, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, major foreign sources of vehicle equipment, place of final assembly and countries of origin of the engine/transmission.

However, NHTSA also noted that such an option would represent a limited exclusion from one of section 210's labeling
requirements. The agency stated that as part of considering this option, as well as possible special requirements
discussed below for multi-stage and low volume manufacturers, it was in the process of determining whether it had
authority to provide limited exclusions from section 210's labeling requirements. NHTSA stated that it would complete
its evaluation before reaching a final decision about possible exclusions. 58 FR 61054.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In commenting on the NPRM, AAMA stated that it supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content, although at a 15 percent content level rather than 35 percent. AAMA also stated that since the agency ``has
implied that it has the authority to set a minimal level for the U.S. and Canadian content which removes a recordkeeping
burden on the low end of content, it urged that such relief also be provided for the high end of content. That organization
recommended that, for carlines with more than 85 percent U.S./Canadian content, manufacturers be permitted to specify
the content as ``at least'' 85 percent instead of specifying a percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foreign vehicle manufacturers strongly supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content. However, several of them argued that unless the agency also permits a limited exclusion from providing the
information required for item two of the label, i.e., the percentage parts content originating from major sources
of foreign content, there would be only a minimal benefit from an exclusion from specifying the percentage U.S./Canadian
parts content. This is because the foreign manufacturers would have to collect detailed information from most of
their suppliers to calculate the information for item two of the label. The foreign manufacturers suggested various
alternative approaches, such as requiring them to specify the countries that constitute major sources of foreign
content but not the percentages from such countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publishing the NPRM, the agency has completed the analysis of its authority to provide exclusions from the Labeling
Act requirements. For reasons which are summarized below, NHTSA has concluded that it does not have the authority
to provide exclusions from the express statutory labeling requirements for either vehicles with low U.S./Canadian
content or vehicles with high U.S./Canadian content. As discussed in the next section of this preamble, however,
the agency may provide limited exclusions for multi-stage manufacturers and low volume manufacturers, based on
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 doctrine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the Labeling Act expressly requires manufacturers to label each vehicle with five items of information:
(1) The ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
percentage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' U.S./Canadian parts content; (2) the names of foreign countries providing at least 15 percent of the parts content
and the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
percentage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' for each such country; (3) final assembly point; and (4) and (5) countries of origin for the engine and transmission.
Items (1) and (2) are calculated on a ``carline'' basis. See section 210(b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a limit to the degree of precision in the percentages required by the Labeling Act. Section 210(b)(2) provides
that ``[t]he percentages required to be indicated by this section may be rounded to the nearest 5 percent by the manufacturers.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement these and other requirements, section 210(d) requires the Secretary to: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section *&blank;*&blank;* Such regulations shall
provide to the ultimate purchaser of a new passenger motor vehicle the best and most understandable information possible
about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary
burdens on the manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Labeling Act does not provide any express authority to create exclusions from the statutory requirements which
apply to vehicle manufacturers. NHTSA notes that while section 210(d) provides that the regulations must not impose
costly and unnecessary burdens on manufacturers, this is not an invitation for the agency to second-guess Congress
about the requirements it has established regarding the specific content information which must be provided to consumers.
As a matter of statutory construction, the agency notes that general provisions cannot be construed as overriding
specific ones. Since all of the exclusions identified above are inconsistent with the statutory language, the relevant
legal question is whether NHTSA has implied authority to create the exclusions notwithstanding such language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a statute does not provide express authority to create exclusions, there are only two circumstances recognized
by the courts in which an agency has implied authority to create exclusions. The first is administrative need, related
to an agency's inability to carry out a mandate fully, and the second is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 circumstances, where following the plain meaning of a statute would lead to ``absurd or futile results'' or to ``a
gain of trivial or no value.'' The courts indicate that both bases for exclusions from the clear command of a statute
are disfavored and that agencies bear a strong burden of proof in attempting to show that adhering to a statute would
have the effects described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since exclusions are not necessary for the agency to carry out its mandate, the only relevant issue is whether the exclusions
can be justified on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 theory. The exclusions cannot be justified if non-trivial benefits are provided by a regulation in those circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has concluded that it does not have authority to provide the above-discussed exclusions from the express statutory
labeling requirements for either vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content or vehicles with high U.S./Canadian content
because the exclusions would permit the labels on a substantial portion of the vehicles sold to provide the consumer
with significantly less information than Congress intended, thereby eliminating much of the benefit that the Labeling
Act was intended to provide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a ``low-end'' exclusion would permit a large percentage of foreign vehicles to be labeled with the words
``minimal'' or less than 35 percent (or some other specified percentage) U.S./Canadian content, instead of being
labeled with a specific percentage. Consumers would not know whether vehicles bearing such labels contained (on
a carline basis) 0 percent, about 15 percent, or possibly even nearly 35 percent U.S./Canadian content. A consumer
wishing to make a purchase decision among vehicles bearing such labels would not be able to compare their U.S./Canadian
content. Similarly, a ``high-end'' exclusion would permit most domestic vehicles to be labeled with the words ``greater
than 85% U.S./Canadian content.'' A consumer wishing to make a purchase decision among vehicles bearing such labels
would not be able to compare their U.S./Canadian content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that section 210(b)(2) allows rounding of the percentages, but limits the rounding ``to the nearest five
percent.'' This indicates that specific percentages must be listed (since general percentages aren't amenable
to rounding) and that any rounding to a greater degree is prohibited. In this regard, it is particularly important
to note that the degree of permissible rounding permitted by the enacted version of section 210 is significantly less
than the degree that would have been permitted in the introduced version. In the introduced version, rounding would
have been permitted to the nearest 10 percent. The enacted version permits rounding only to the nearest 5 percent.
Thus, Congress focused particular attention on the issue of rounding and decided to adopt strict limits. Moreover,
implicit in the enacted rounding provision is a judgment by Congress that differences in content of as little as five
percentage points are significant enough to be considered by the consumer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, several foreign vehicle manufacturers requested an exclusion from the statutory requirement
to specify the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content. Volkswagen stated that
its recommendation for such an exclusion is ``consistent with the intent of the original bill,'' but recognized that
the statutory requirement to list the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content
was added by the House/Senate Conference Committee. Volkswagen argued that ``the Committee did not appear to have
assigned great importance to the inclusion of foreign sourced parts percentages.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that it must implement a statute as finally passed by the Congress, and not an earlier version that was not
passed. Moreover, the agency must follow the plain meaning of a statute and cannot ignore express statutory requirements
based on a belief that a Congressional committee may not have assigned great importance to a particular requirement.
The committee, and ultimately the Congress, thought the requirement at issue was important enough to pass into law.
Congress decided that prospective purchasers should know the percentage parts content that originated from major
sources of foreign content. This particular requirement primarily applies to foreign vehicles, since domestic
vehicles are less likely to have major sources of foreign content. Yet, the exclusions recommended by the foreign
manufacturers would permit a large percentage of foreign vehicles to labeled without this information. Such exclusions
cannot be considered

The agency does observe that the additional flexibility it is providing with respect to how country of origin is determined
for purposes of item 2 of the label should help reduce manufacturer costs in this area.

G. Multi-Stage Manufacturers and Small Businesses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to exclude multi-stage manufacturers of ``carlines'' of fewer than 1,000 vehicles from providing
items 1 and 2 of the label (the two items that are determined on a carline basis). However, these manufacturers would
be required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. Similarly, the agency proposed to apply the same limited requirements
to businesses that produce a total of fewer than 1,000 passenger motor vehicles for sale in the United States annually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency explained that the concept of carline is largely meaningless for many multi-stage manufacturers. Many
of the vehicles made in the multi-stage process are highly specialized, and are often built to order. A ``carline''
in this instance could consist of only several vehicles. The agency stated that it did not believe that Congress had
this situation in mind when it defined carline. Moreover, to the extent that vehicles are built to order, prospective
purchasers may not be able to inspect a content label prior to making a purchase decision. NHTSA also stated in the NPRM
that it believes that the same arguments made concerning multi-stage manufacturers, regarding carlines with a minimal
number a vehicles produced annually, can be made in a discussion of small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its discussion of multi-stage vehicles, the agency noted that alterers are not covered by section 210 for reasons
similar to those discussed above concerning dealer and port-installed options. Alterers modify completed vehicles,
after they have left the manufacturer's final assembly point. The parts they use are not considered equipment by section
210 of the Cost Savings Act, because they are never shipped to the final assembly point. Their modifications cannot
affect carline-basis calculations made before the start of the model year, and cannot be known in advance of the model
year by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTEA stated that it agrees with agency's tentative determination that the label on vehicles produced in multiple
stages should differ from the label on mass produced vehicles. It also stated that it is confident the agency has authority
under the Labeling Act to promulgate different rules, and believes the Act could be interpreted to allow even a full
exclusion for multi-stage vehicles. NTEA stated that requiring small business multi-stage manufacturers to calculate
U.S./Canadian versus foreign percentages would be extremely burdensome in both an economic and practical sense
as they would need to do so on a per vehicle basis. That organization added that any ancillary reporting or recordkeeping
requirements would also need to be done on a per vehicle basis. NTEA noted that the proposed multi-stage rules would
require information on final assembly point and place of manufacture of the engine and transmission. That commenter
stated that this would allow a consumer to know where the vehicle was built and whether the most valuable individual
mechanical components, the engine and transmission, are of foreign or domestic origin. NTEA also stated that the
burden on small business multi-stage manufacturers would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIAM stated that it applauds NHTSA's recognition of providing some regulatory relief to small automotive manufacturers.
It suggested that the agency expand the proposed exclusion for small manufacturers from fewer than 1,000 vehicles
to fewer than 2,500 vehicles. That organization stated that this would provide relief from the costly burdens the
Act imposes on additional small manufacturers without depriving consumers of information deemed necessary by the
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coachmen stated that the ``concessions'' made in the NPRM fall far short of what was requested by RVIA in commenting
on the request for comments. Coachmen argued that the proposed requirements would impose an undue and costly and unnecessary
burden on Coachmen. It recommended that the final rule should exclude carlines of less than 20,000 per year, exclude
recreation vehicle manufacturers and van converters, or, as a less desirable alternative, provide simplified and
less costly compliance recordkeeping and reporting requirements based on using the information provided solely
by the original vehicle manufacturer on a pass through basis. Coachmen stated that it has several divisions, some
of which are final stage manufacturers and others van converters. It stated that the process of documenting and re-computing
percentage of domestic content of vehicles would require large amounts of paperwork, additional labor and possible
delays in shipments, but result in a minuscule change in the original vehicle manufacturer's domestic content.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Coachmen stated that the motor vehicles it receives for further manufacture are supplied by the Big Three, which Coachmen
assumed would have a domestic content label affixed to the incomplete vehicle. That company argued that individual
per unit costs of implementation would be significantly higher than for the Big Three, creating a competitive disadvantage.
Coachmen argued that the intent of the legislation relates to large volume producers, and that regulations should
not be extended to multi-stage manufacturers, final stage manufacturers or van converters. That company stated
that in addition to the interpretation as to the types of vehicles to be included, the issue of what constitutes a carline
should be redefined. Coachmen stated that by using the figure of 1,000 vehicles per year as the upper limit of applicability,
NHTSA has not considered the intent of the legislation. Coachmen noted that it has a van conversion division whose
annual production is a small fraction of the total market but does exceed the 1,000 unit limit by a considerable amount.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to exclude all final stage manufacturers, as well as all businesses
that produce a total of fewer than 1,000 passenger motor vehicles for sale in the United States annually, from providing
items 1 and 2 of the label (the two items that are determined on a carline basis). However, these manufacturers are required
to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that these exclusions are justified on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
theory, i.e., only trivial additional benefits would be provided by not adopting the exclusions. First, NHTSA believes
that the total number of vehicles affected by the exclusions is less than one percent of the vehicles covered by the
statutory requirements. This is very different than the ``low end'' and ``high end'' exclusions considered above,
which would each affect a large percentage of total vehicles. Second, these exclusions largely affect vehicles which
are likely to be made to order and for which consumers would often not be able to inspect a label prior to making a purchase
decision. Thus, even if full labeling information was provided for these vehicles, it often could not be used by consumers
in making purchase decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees with AIAM's suggestion that the exclusion for small manufacturers be changed to apply to manufacturers
which produce fewer than 1,000 vehicles to ones which produce fewer than 2,500 vehicles. As discussed above, the agency's
implied authority to provide exclusions from express statutory requirements is very limited. It is the agency's
judgment that the proposed limit is sufficient to cover small manufacturers which are likely to only produce vehicles
to order and for which consumers are unlikely to be able to inspect a vehicle label (e.g., on a demonstrator vehicle)
prior to making a purchase decision. Moreover, the concerns about carline determinations being made for only a few
vehicles are not likely to be relevant. In short, the agency believes that AIAM's recommended exclusion cannot be
justified on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
theory. Extending the scope of the exclusion would unnecessarily deny prospective vehicle purchasers relevant
content information that Congress decided they should have. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons, NHTSA is not adopting Coachmen's recommendation that the final rule exclude carlines of less
than 20,000 per year and exclude recreation vehicle manufacturers, i.e., the exclusions would unnecessarily deny
prospective vehicle purchasers relevant content information that Congress decided they should have. With respect
to that company's recommendation that the final rule exclude van converters, NHTSA notes that many van converters
are excluded as a result of being alterers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, NHTSA has decided to exclude all final stage manufacturers from the requirements to provide items 1 and 2
on the label, rather than limiting the exclusion to multi-stage manufacturers of ``carlines'' of fewer than 1,000
vehicles. The reason for this relates both to the relatively small number of multi-stage vehicles subject to the Labeling
Act requirements and the fact that key statutory definitions relevant to parts content calculations do not appear
to contemplate vehicles manufactured in more than one stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, section 210 defines ``final assembly point'' as ``the plant, factory, or other place at which
a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a manufacturer and from which such vehicle is delivered to
a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile
are included with such vehicle *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Moreover, section 210 provides that costs incurred at or beyond
the final assembly point are not included in parts content calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For multi-stage vehicles, it is not clear from the statutory definition whether ``final assembly point'' refers
to the place where an incomplete vehicle is assembled or to the place of final stage manufacture. Regardless of which
location is considered to be the point of final assembly, problems can occur in applying the statutory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assume, for example, the possibility of considering the place where the incomplete vehicle is assembled as the final
assembly point. An incomplete vehicle includes, as a minimum, a frame and chassis structure, power train, steering
system, suspension system, and braking system, to the extent that those systems are to be part of the completed vehicle.
See 49 CFR Part 568. It might have all component parts necessary for mechanical operation. However, the vehicle is
not delivered to a dealer or importer from the plant where the incomplete vehicle is assembled. Moreover, a large number
of the vehicle's parts may not be included at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assume instead the possibility of considering the place of final stage manufacture as the final assembly point. It
might be argued that the incomplete vehicle manufacturer should be considered an outside supplier of passenger motor
vehicle equipment. However, section 210 defines passenger motor vehicle equipment as ``any system, subassembly,
or component received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle *&blank;*&blank;*.''
An incomplete vehicle does not fit this definition. Moreover, if the incomplete vehicle manufacturer were considered
an outside supplier of equipment, the bulk of final assembly costs (of the incomplete vehicle) would be included in
parts content calculations, a result that is clearly inconsistent with Congressional intent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It might be possible for NHTSA to develop an alternative approach to solve these problems, such as considering the
place where the incomplete vehicle is manufactured and the place of final stage manufacture to both be final assembly
points. However, any such approach would be complicated and itself require a departure from the express statutory
language. Given that the total number of multi-stage vehicles subject to the Labeling Act is relatively small and
the fact that the statutory definitions do not appear to contemplate vehicles manufactured in more than one stage,
the agency believes it is appropriate to simply exclude all such vehicles from the requirements related to items 1
and 2 of the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final stage manufacturers are required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. The agency is specifying, for purposes
of item 3 of the label, that the final assembly point for multi-stage vehicles is the location where the incomplete
vehicle is assembled. The agency is specifying this location because, unlike the location of final manufacture,
it will always involve significant final assembly operations.

H. Recordkeeping Requirements; Supplier Certifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210(d) provides that the agency must promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out section
210, including regulations to establish a procedure to verify the required labeling information, and regulations
applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether a component provided by such
suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign. As discussed in the NPRM, in order to verify the information
provided on labels, NHTSA contemplates that it would conduct, on an occasional basis, an audit of the information
provided on a label. Such an audit would involve requiring the vehicle manufacturer to provide the agency with the
manufacturer's basis for the information it provided on the label, e.g., all relevant certifications from suppliers,
a listing of parts, cost information, and all calculations used by the manufacturer to derive the information provided
on the label. NHTSA would check whether the manufacturer's methodology was consistent with agency regulations.
The agency would similarly require individual suppliers to provide the basis for the information and certification
that they provided manufacturers or allied suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that the agency can conduct such an audit, as well as otherwise enforce the labeling requirements,
NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to maintain all records which provide a basis for the information they provide
on labels, and to similarly require suppliers to maintain records providing the basis for the information and certification
they provide to manufacturers or allied suppliers. Noting that EPA requires fuel economy records to be retained for
five years after the model year to which they relate, NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to maintain records
for five years after December 31 of the model year to which the records relate, and to require suppliers to maintain
records, which form a basis for the information they provide to manufacturers or allied suppliers, for six years after
December 31 of the calendar year set forth in their submissions to manufacturers/allied suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also addressed the issue of whether manufacturers should have the option of maintaining records electronically.
The agency stated that it believes manufacturers and allied suppliers should retain the original copies of information
provided by suppliers, but sought comment on whether to allow them to retain the certifications and other information
obtained from suppliers electronically, specifically in the form of electronic images. NHTSA proposed to permit
manufacturers and suppliers to maintain all other records in either paper or electronic form for purposes of data
storage, provided that in every case all of the information contained in the record is retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous commenters argued that certifications and other information should be permitted to be submitted to manufacturers/allied
suppliers electronically, as well as stored electronically. AAMA stated that it objects to manufacturers receiving
and maintaining original copies of certificates. That organization stated that with the enactment of the Customs
Modernization Act, GM, Ford and Chrysler are developing process to collect all content and customs data electronically.
Ford argued that electronic storage is more efficient and cost effective and is consistent with the recently signed
Customs Automation Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota also recommended against any requirement to obtain or retain actual paper certificates. It stated that the
rules should allow all required records to be retained electronically. APMA stated that the proposed requirements
to require suppliers to generate paper originals for certificates would be burdensome and impede the spread of EDI.
That organization stated that the adoption of the AIAG/EDI package into the content reporting requirements under
NAFTA is expected to begin in 1995. It recommended that all records be allowed to be kept in any medium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that it supports the proposal to require written certifications by suppliers to manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissan stated that it believes that a five to six year retention period is excessive. It suggested a retention period
for manufacturers of three years after December 31 of the model year to which records relate, and, for suppliers, a
retention period of four years after December 31 of the calendar year set forth in the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to permit certifications and other records to be submitted and
retained electronically. The agency believes that this is consistent with the approach being taken by the Federal
government in related areas, and with section 210's requirement to establish regulations that avoid imposing unnecessary
and costly burdens on the manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has also decided to require records to be maintained for the periods proposed in the NPRM. As discussed above,
these requirements ensure that records are maintained for five years after the end of the model year to which they relate.
The agency disagrees with Nissan that the retention period is excessive. A possible audit of the information provided
on a label could take substantial time, particularly given the need to trace the information back to suppliers. NHTSA
also notes that the cost of maintaining records is substantially reduced to the extent that manufacturers use electronic
means.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to require vehicle manufacturers to submit to the agency three copies of the information that will
appear on each carline's label. The agency proposed to require submittal of this information for each carline not
later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is delivered to dealers for that model year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency stated that it believes this reporting requirement is necessary for several reasons. It would provide
one central location from which information can be gathered concerning the labels. Inquiries could come from within
the agency, or from interested members of the public. In addition, such reporting would aid the agency in deciding
whether to initiate any investigations or audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received several comments on the proposed reporting requirements. AAMA stated that the proposed requirements
should be modified to require submittal of information not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is offered
for sale to the ultimate purchaser. Isuzu suggested that flexibility be introduced to permit manufacturers to submit
a report whenever a major specification change has been made in the middle of a model year or whenever the manufacturer
opts to change the model year at a timing different from normally accepted model year changes. NTEA stated that it understands
that small multi-stage businesses are not subject to the reporting requirements unless they produce carlines of
over 1,000 vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the agency has decided to adopt reporting requirements along the line of the proposal,
but to require submittal of information not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is offered for sale
to the ultimate purchaser. This date will be adequate for the agency's purposes in monitoring the information on the
labels. Moreover, this date is consistent with the agency's decision, discussed above, not to require labels to be
placed on vehicles prior to the introduction date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency cannot provide flexibility to permit manufacturers to update labels during a model year, since section
210(b) provides that content percentages are ``established at the beginning of each model year for such carline and
shall be applicable to that carline for the entire model year.'' There is therefore no reason to provide flexibility
with respect to reporting updated information. However, if a manufacturer discovers an error in the information
reported to the agency, it should send information to the agency correcting that error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with NTEA that any manufacturer that is not required to provide information on a carline basis, i.e.,
items one and two on the label, is not subject to the reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

J. Leadtime/First Year Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of manufacturers and suppliers argued that they cannot comply with all the data collection and calculation
requirements by the October 1994 implementation date. AAMA stated that the proposed regulation will require extensive
data collection and calculation requirements, and that there are several areas of uncertainty that will not be resolved
until a final rule is issued. It stated that it has been working in conjunction with the AIAG and a number of suppliers
to establish processes to comply with the law, but has been unable to complete this activity because of uncertainties
about the final rule. AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers will not be able to comply with all the data collection
and calculation requirements by October 1994. It requested NHTSA to allow manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures
that are expected to yield similar results for at least 12 months after the final rule is published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM stated that because of the scope of the effort to comply with the new requirements, at least one year is required between
the publication of the final rule and the effective date of the rule. That manufacturer stated that it supports the
interim AAMA proposal of making a best efforts determination of domestic and foreign content for the AALA required
label using presently available CAFE cost and origin data for the first year after publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford submitted a comment along the lines of that of AAMA. It also provided NHTSA with a copy of an EPA final rule, published
in February 1993, which established labeling requirements for products manufactured with certain ozone-depleting
substances. EPA stated in the preamble for that final rule that it recognized the practical problems the regulated
community would have in meeting a May 15, 1993 statutory deadline for labeling, ``given the late publication of this
rule.'' 58 FR 8136, February 11, 1993. EPA stated that ``(a)s a result of the concerns, it is the Agency's policy to take
no enforcement action for matters occurring during the first nine months following the publication of these regulations.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that if NHTSA does not permit manufacturers a permanent alternative of using existing, substantial business
records to make parts content calculations, it should allow such an alternative on an interim basis in lieu of granting
additional leadtime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calsonic stated that the proposed leadtime for suppliers was extremely short and requested postponement of at least
a year. Nippondenso also stated that the proposed leadtime for suppliers was short, and requested that the effective
date of the regulations be postponed for at least six months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA agrees, given the complexity of the data collection and calculation requirements,
that it is impossible for manufacturers and suppliers to fully comply with all of the requirements by October 1, 1994.
The agency notes that this conclusion is partly based on the fact that manufacturers cannot complete their calculations
until they receive specified information from suppliers, and allied suppliers cannot complete their calculations
until they receive specified information from outside suppliers. The conclusion is also partly based on the fact
that many of the requirements are in the regulation as opposed to section 210, i.e., manufacturers and suppliers could
not comply with the data collection and calculation requirements absent a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is nonetheless faced with the section 210(b) requirement that labels be provided on each vehicle manufactured
on or after October 1, 1994. The agency agrees with AAMA that the most appropriate means for resolving this problem
is to permit manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar results, for about a
year. The agency believes that this temporary alternative will ensure that consumers receive the best information
possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of vehicles they are considering purchasing during this period,
given that full compliance by manufacturers and suppliers is not possible. NHTSA has decided to adopt the following
specific requirement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June
1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the calculation procedures set forth in this part,
use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA notes several things about this temporary alternative approach. First, it is available for all model year 1995
vehicles and for any model year 1996 vehicles which are introduced before June 1, 1995. The agency selected the June
1, 1995 date because it ensures manufacturers additional flexibility for about a one-year period. NHTSA notes that
since most model year 1996 vehicles will be introduced in the fall of 1995, manufacturers will have additional flexibility
for early introductions (a model year 1996 vehicle could be introduced as early as January 1995, for which full compliance
might not be possible), but will need to meet the full requirements for the vast majority of model year 1996 vehicles.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, manufacturers may use any procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield ``similar results.'' For example,
the manufacturers could use the CAFE procedures for making content determinations so long as they made adjustments
to attempt to account for differences between the CAFE content requirements and Labeling Act requirements, e.g.,
CAFE does not exclude assembly, sales, and marketing costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, manufacturers may choose to rely entirely on information they already have in their possession or, at their
option, obtain additional information from some suppliers to help them make the necessary calculations. To the extent
that manufacturers are following this alternative approach, their suppliers may as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that Nissan asked, in a telephone call to NHTSA's Office of Chief Counsel, how the Labeling Act requirements
apply to MY 1994 vehicles that are manufactured on or after October 1, 1994. As discussed below, it is the agency's opinion
that the Act's requirements do not apply to any MY 1994 vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first sentence of section 210(b)(1) reads as follows: ``Each manufacturer of a new passenger motor vehicle distributed
for commerce for sale in the United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
shall annually establish for each model year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and cause to be affixed *&blank;*&blank;* on each vehicle manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, in a prominent
place, one or more labels *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Section 210(b)(2) provides that the percentages required for the
label ``shall be established at the beginning of the model year *&blank;*&blank;*.'' With respect to the issue of
how the Labeling Act requirements apply to MY 1994 vehicles, NHTSA believes it is significant that: (1) The requirement
to label vehicles takes effect on the date traditionally considered to be the beginning of MY 1995 (October 1, 1994),
and (2) the percentages required to be included on the label are to be established at the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the model year. Reading these provisions together, the agency believes that the statute requires the labeling
requirements to begin with MY 1995 vehicles, since the time when the percentages are to be established for that model
year corresponds to the effective date of the requirements. NHTSA notes that very few MY 1994 vehicles are likely to
be manufactured on or after October 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA addressed several issues concerning the supplier definitions in the NPRM. In commenting on the request for
comments, Ford had asked that NHTSA consider a supplier owned jointly by more than one parent company as an allied supplier
of both parents, especially in situations such as those in Canada, in which the Canadian government has laws requiring
partial Canadian ownership of share. NHTSA stated that it believes that such a situation is akin to the joint venture
agreement mentioned in section 210(f)(15) of the Cost Savings Act. The agency tentatively decided to treat the supplier
in such a case as being wholly owned by one of the manufacturers in the joint venture agreement, and therefore an allied
supplier for purposes of any carline jointly manufactured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After further consideration, however, NHTSA has decided that it cannot fully accommodate this suggestion by Ford.
The agency notes that Ford made the following statement in its comment on the request for comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that suppliers and plants owned, operated, or controlled by the parent company (i.e., a consolidated subsidiary
of the parent company or ``joint venture'' of partners in which the parent holds a majority interest) should be treated
as allied suppliers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, Ford appears to have been asking that the agency replace the specification in the statute that suppliers be ``wholly
owned'' with a specification that they merely have to be ``controlled.'' NHTSA does not believe there is any justification
for such a departure from the statute. Moreover, the agency believes that the statement in the NPRM that the situation
is ``akin'' to the joint venture agreement mentioned in section 210(f)(15) was incorrect, i.e., there is no analogy
between the two situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the agency is clarifying the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
allied supplier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to encompass varying corporate structures where ownership is complete. However, a mere control relationship is
not sufficient to make a supplier ``allied.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the agency specifically addressed the issue of a supplier owned by the parent company of the manufacturer.
NHTSA stated that it recognizes that a supplier owned by the parent company of a manufacturer is not strictly wholly
owned by the manufacturer. The agency noted, however, that if the parent is a holding company that wholly owns both
the manufacturer and the supplier, there is no meaningful difference in this situation from that in which the strict
definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
wholly owned
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occurs. In other words, there are no outside interests represented (as occurs if there are outside shareholders).
Therefore, the agency tentatively decided to treat a supplier wholly owned by the parent holding company of a manufacturer
as an allied supplier, provided that the parent holding company also wholly owns the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, NHTSA indicated that it read section 210(f)(17) as requiring wholly owned suppliers to allied suppliers
to be treated as outside suppliers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received a number of comments on the supplier definitions. Ford stated that to clarify the difference between
suppliers and distributors, a definition of supplier should be incorporated into the definition section. It recommended
the following definition, which it indicated is consistent with NAFTA_The term supplier means a person or an enterprise
that manufactures or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not agree that distributors should be eliminated from the definition of supplier. NHTSA observes
that a distributor may supply passenger motor vehicle equipment to a manufacturer. Moreover, a manufacturer might
have a relationship with a distributor to obtain certain equipment but not with the company which manufacturers or
assembles the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford also stated that the outside supplier definition requires clarification. It argued that the definition in the
statute was not intended to include, in any way, allied suppliers. It stated that the regulation should clearly eliminate
allied suppliers from the definition. Ford noted that an interpretation that an allied supplier becomes an outside
supplier to the extent that it supplies equipment to another allied supplier could result in an allied supplied part
having two sets of content values: the actual U.S./Canadian content when the component is supplied to the final assembly
plant, and a rolled-up or down U.S./Canadian content when the component is sent to another allied manufacturing facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering Ford's comment, NHTSA has reconsidered its view that section 210(f)(17) requires wholly owned
suppliers to allied suppliers to be treated as outside suppliers. The basis for that view was that a wholly owned supplier
to an allied supplier falls within the section 210(f)(17) definition of outside supplier. However, such a supplier
also falls within the section 210(f)(15) definition of allied supplier. The agency agrees that it is appropriate
to resolve this ambiguity in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only significant difference between the statutory treatment of allied and outside suppliers is that allied suppliers
must provide actual U.S./Canadian content information, while the roll-up, roll-down provision applies to outside
suppliers. Thus, Congress decided that suppliers which are wholly owned by manufacturers should generally be held
to a higher standard concerning the specificity of the U.S./Canadian content information that they provide. Given
this difference, the agency agrees with Ford that an allied supplier should not be considered an outside supplier
simply because it supplies equipment to an allied supplier. NHTSA also notes that if an allied supplier were to be treated
as an outside supplier in such a context, manufacturers could obtain the benefits of the roll-up, roll-down provision
for their allied suppliers, simply by having them ship their equipment through another allied supplier. This position
is reflected in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
allied supplier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 set forth in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota stated that the proposed regulation does not address the scope of the statutory term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
allied supplier.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That manufacturer stated that because some issues have arisen concerning the statutory definition, it recommends
that the regulation provide certain clarifications. Toyota stated that the determination of whether the allied
supplier relationship exists within the statutory meaning does not depend on the number of levels of ownership but
on the nature of ownership, i.e., whether it is complete ownership. That manufacturer stated that it should not matter
whether ownership is direct or indirect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda stated that NHTSA proposed to treat as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
allied
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a supplier wholly owned by the same parent company that wholly owns the manufacturer. That company stated that NHTSA's
analysis does not extend quite far enough to encompass Honda's corporate structure. According to that manufacturer,
two parent companies within the Honda group together wholly own both the manufacturer and the supplier. No outside
interests are represented. Honda requested clarification in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA agrees with these comments of Honda and Toyota, which the agency believes are consistent with the approach taken
in the NPRM for suppliers owned by the parent company of the manufacturer. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
allied supplier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the final rule clarifies the meaning of that term with respect to the corporate relationships discussed by those
commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Definitions of Dealer and Ultimate Purchaser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 210(f)(7) defines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
dealer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to mean ``any person or resident located in the United States, including any territory of the United States, or the
District of Columbia, engaged in the sale or the distribution of new automobiles to the ultimate purchaser.'' Section
210(f)(6) defines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
new passenger motor vehicle
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to mean ``a passenger motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred by a manufacturer,
distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIADA stated that in the case where a state or local jurisdiction has chosen to regulate the automobile industry and
the conduct of the industry through franchise laws, it believes the definition of dealer in the state or local franchise
law should apply to this Act. That organization stated that in promulgating regulations without clarifying the term
dealer, NHTSA could inadvertently undermine state and local franchise laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that since the Labeling Act includes an express definition of the meaning of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
dealer,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the agency cannot delegate to states or local jurisdictions the right to change the definition for purposes of the
Labeling Act. The agency notes, however, that the Labeling Act and implementing regulation merely require persons
engaged in the sale or distribution of new automobiles to the ultimate purchaser to maintain the content label. Neither
the Act nor the regulation specifies any requirements concerning who is permitted to be a dealer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIADA also stated that clarification is needed with respect to the meaning of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ultimate purchaser.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That organization stated that without such clarification, there could be confusion and unnecessary liability for
dealers. AIADA stated that for vehicles in rental service, demonstrator service and executive service, the law is
unclear as to who is the ultimate purchaser. That organization asked the agency to specify what transaction results
in an individual or entity being an ultimate purchaser. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to add the following definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ultimate purchaser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to the regulation: The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ultimate purchaser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means with respect to any new passenger motor vehicle, the first person, other than a dealer purchasing in its capacity
as a dealer, who in good faith purchases such new passenger motor vehicle for purposes other than resale. This definition
is based on one used in the Automobile Information Disclosure Act (AIDA), 15 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1233, the Act which
requires the Monroney label. NHTSA believes that it is appropriate to adopt this definition given that the Labeling
Act's definitions of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
dealer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
new passenger motor vehicle,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which use the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ultimate purchaser,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are also based on definitions included in the AIDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except to the extent otherwise provided in the regulation established by today's final rule, e.g., with respect to
temporary removal of separate content labels for test drives, NHTSA plans to treat vehicles in rental service, demonstrator
service and executive service the same for Labeling Act purposes as the Justice Department treats these vehicles
for purposes of Monroney labels. NHTSA believes that this is appropriate, given the same general purposes of the labels,
and the similarity of the relevant definitions in the statutes and, in the case of the Labeling Act, the implementing
regulation. The agency is including in the docket a copy of a February 24, 1994 letter from the Justice Department which
provides additional guidance in these areas.

3. Joint Ventures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA stated in the NPRM that several commenters on the request for comments had noted that there are carlines manufactured
jointly by two manufacturers, and requested that the agency permit the manufacturers to determine between themselves
which would be responsible for tracking, record keeping and labeling. The agency tentatively agreed that this would
be an appropriate approach and proposed requirements to permit multiple manufacturers to determine among themselves
which of them is to be considered the vehicle manufacturer for purposes of the labeling requirements. The agency also
proposed to specify that, in the absence of such an agreement, the carline ``shall be attributed to the single manufacturer
that markets the carline.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissan stated that it would not like to see language that specifies a procedure to determine the manufacturer of record.
It stated that the selection of the manufacturer of record should be determined in accordance with the statutory language
and agreement between the partners involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Isuzu stated that it believes the final rule must specify that if no written article exists in a joint-venture agreement
regarding manufacturer responsibility, carline responsibility is attributed to the manufacturer mentioned in
certification label with respect to the safety standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a telephone call to NHTSA's Office of Chief Counsel, an attorney representing Toyota asked whether the Geo and the
Corolla, are in one or two carlines. These are very similar vehicles, produced on the same assembly line, one of which
is marketed by GM and the other by Toyota. NUMMI stated that the Corolla is manufactured in Japan, at NUMMI in California,
and in Canada. That company stated that the NPRM, in discussing joint ownership/joint production relationships,
attributed carline to the manufacturer that markets the carline, subject to certain conditions. NUMMI argued that
the use of the word ``manufacturer'' in this case implies each production location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the agency has decided that multiple manufacturers should generally be permitted
to determine among themselves which of them is considered the vehicle manufacturer for purposes of the labeling requirements.
NHTSA also believes it is appropriate to specify that, in the absence of such an agreement, a vehicle is attributed
to the manufacturer which markets the vehicle. This approach provides maximum manufacturer flexibility, while
also specifying who is responsible for labeling in the absence of an agreement among the joint venturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes, however, that additional clarification is needed concerning the meaning of ``carline'' in the joint
venture context. While manufacturers may determine between themselves who is responsible for tracking, recordkeeping
and labeling, they must follow the specified requirements for making carline determinations. As discussed earlier
in this notice, section 210 specifies that the term ``carline'' means a name denoting a group of vehicles which has
a degree of commonality in construction. It is the agency's opinion that the Geo and Corolla are in different carlines,
because they have different names. Moreover, to the extent that NUMMI produced Corollas in California and Toyota
produced similar or identical Corollas in Japan, all of the Corollas must be placed in the same carline, given the statutory
definition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Currency Exchange Rate Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since currency exchange rates may fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, thereby affecting domestic content valuations,
NHTSA proposed a methodology for determining the exchange rate to be used. The agency stated in the NPRM that it believes
that, in the interest of consistency, the percentages printed on the labels required by section 210 should be determined
using the same basis. The agency proposed a specific procedure for calculating currency exchange rates, similar
to that set forth in EPA's CAFE regulation. Manufacturers would be required to take the mean of the exchange rates in
effect at the end of each quarter set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for twelve calendar quarters prior to and
including the calendar ending one year prior to the date that the manufacturer submits information to the agency for
a carline. The agency proposed essentially the same procedure for suppliers, replacing the date the manufacturer
submits information to the agency with the date of the information the supplier provides to a manufacturer or allied
supplier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA noted that EPA had suggested that NHTSA allow exchange rate calculations based on Purchasing Power Parity Rates
(PPP), provided that a manufacturer was already using an approved PPP calculation for EPA purposes. EPA allows an
exemption from the normally required exchange rate calculations, based on a petition. EPA stated that it believes
that, by coordinating the fuel economy and content labeling decisions, consistency between the two agencies will
be maintained. NHTSA stated that it was considering adopting the EPA suggestion, particularly by requiring a manufacturer
to use the same conversion method for content label purposes as was approved by the EPA for fuel economy purposes. The
agency sought suggestions on this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers should have the option to convert foreign currency utilizing the exchange
rates used in the financial records at the time the content calculations are made. It stated that under this option,
all financial data used to calculate content will be internally consistent and tie directly with the financial records.
That organization also stated that this option would avoid the major systems revisions that may be required under
the proposed average exchange rate methodology. AAMA also stated that the option maintains consistency between
the treatment of the prices of many commodities, where the prices fluctuate dramatically, and currency prices in
that none of these prices are smoothed by averaging. Finally, AAMA stated that the option facilitates the same base
cost data that is required to calculate origin under NAFTA, which will reduce the burden on manufacturers and suppliers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota urged the agency to adopt a rule under which all manufacturers must use the same method for converting currency.
That manufacturer argued that EPA's suggested approach would depart from this principle by requiring a manufacturer
to use the same method as approved by EPA for fuel economy purposes. Toyota stated that the EPA approach is legally unsound
and will produce inconsistent information for consumers comparing vehicles for possible purchase. Toyota argued
that, from a legal standpoint, the fuel economy calculation is made pursuant to a different statute with a different
purpose. That manufacturer stated further that, with respect to the currency exchange method that should be used,
it believes that PPP is the most appropriate method for currency conversion and that use of this method by all manufacturers
will result in consistency of calculation and avoid difficulties caused by rapid fluctuations in exchange rates.
Toyota stated that if NHTSA does not require PPP, the agency should require currency conversion to be conducted according
to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Toyota stated that it believes that GAAP is preferable for Labeling
Act purposes to the proposed method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitsubishi stated that manufacturers should have the option of using PPP. It stated that this would be consistent
with the EPA domestic content calculation for CAFE purposes. That company added that, in the interests of fairness,
the same restrictions should apply as under the CAFE regulations_manufacturers should have the option of using PPP,
but first they must get approval, and then cannot switch back and forth merely to get the optimal rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt the proposed method for determining exchange rates, including
requiring a manufacturer to use the same conversion method for content label purposes as was approved by the EPA for
fuel economy purposes. The agency believes that this approach provides flexibility to manufacturers, while ensuring
that they use appropriate methods for determining exchange rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that AAMA's recommendation to permit manufacturers and suppliers to use the currency rates that
are used in their financial records at the time the content calculations are made is so broad as not to amount to any specification
for determining exchange rates. A manufacturer could use any method it chose and could switch back and forth between
methods to obtain the rates it desired. By contrast, EPA permits a degree of flexibility, but ensures that an appropriate
method is used and that it is not changed back and forth between years. The agency notes that if a manufacturer obtains
EPA approval for whatever method is reflected in its financial records, it can use that method for both EPA and Labeling
Act purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Toyota is correct that different manufacturers can use different methods for determining exchange rates,
it has not shown that this will result in significant differences in label values. Moreover, it has not shown why differences
in the purposes of the CAFE and Labeling statutes should result in different approaches for determining exchange
rates. Since both statutes require making determinations about the content of passenger motor vehicles, NHTSA believes
it is appropriate for EPA and NHTSA to follow the same approach for determining exchange rates.

5. Value Added by Foreign Suppliers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA noted in the NPRM that section 210(f)(5)(B) provides a specific formula for determining the U.S./Canadian
content of equipment received by manufacturers from allied suppliers. The formula provides first that the foreign
content is determined by adding up the purchase price of all foreign material purchased from outside suppliers that
comprise the individual passenger motor vehicle equipment, and then subtracting such purchase price from the total
purchase price of such equipment. The remainder is the U.S./Canadian content of the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency noted that this formula does not appear to take into account the possibility that an allied supplier may
be foreign, since it assumes that everything, except for the foreign value passed through from outside suppliers,
is U.S./Canadian. Based on a reading of the statute as a whole, NHTSA stated that it does not believe Congress intended
to convert the entire value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content. Therefore,
the proposed regulation treated the value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada as non-U.S./Canadian.
NHTSA specifically requested comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA stated that it agrees with NHTSA that value added by allied suppliers located in a foreign country should be treated
as foreign. Nissan stated that it agrees that it may not have been the intent of the law to treat parts obtained from allied
suppliers outside the U.S./Canada as U.S./Canadian parts content. APMA stated that it supports this part of the proposal
on the ground that it is responsive to Congress' intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BMW stated that it agrees with NHTSA that the intent of the legislation was not to include value added outside U.S./Canada
from foreign allied suppliers as domestic content and that, accordingly, it supports the language NHTSA has proposed.
BMW expressed concern, however, that in many instances throughout the NPRM preamble, NHTSA referred to the explicit
language of the legislation and stated that deviation from this language is not allowed. BMW stated that if NHTSA is
able to deviate from the explicit language of the legislation in this case, the reasoning for refusing to modify other
wording seems inconsistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to follow the approach discussed in the NPRM. The agency notes that
no commenters disagreed with the agency's view that Congress did not intend to convert the entire value added by allied
suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to BMW's comment, the agency notes that its interpretation is based on principles of statutory construction
related to ``whole statute'' interpretation and limits of literalism. See Sutherland Stat Const &sect;&sect;46.05
and 46.07 (5th Ed). Basically, a statute should not be read literally where such a reading is contrary to its purposes.
NHTSA does not believe that anyone could reasonably argue that Congress intended to convert the entire value added
by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content; that result flies in the face of the statute
as a whole and its purpose. The agency does not believe that any of the other situations referred by BMW are similar.

AIAM stated that before promulgating a final rule, NHTSA should consult with USTR to determine whether the rule is
consistent with NAFTA and particularly Article 300 providing for national treatment of goods produced in the territories
of the signatory parties. AIAM also stated that USTR should be asked whether the rule is consistent with those U.S.
treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation that convey most favored national treatment and national treatment
for investors and goods, particularly in light of the special treatment afforded to Canadian production. Nippondenso
stated that Mexico should be treated on the same basis and Canada under the Labeling Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposed labelling system would indeed not give any useful information about the product as such or its characteristics.
The only information contained on the label would be whether, and to what extent, the individual parts of the product
are of American or Canadian origin. In the opinion of the EC, the U.S. measure can only have the objective to influence
consumers to buy American or Canadian motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EC believes that the U.S. proposal constitutes an unjustifiable discrimination, contrary to article 2.1 of the
GATT Code on Technical Barriers to trade: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;the U.S. proposed obligation to indicate the origin of the engine and gearbox could discourage U.S. constructors
to import them from their European subsidiaries or from European component manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;within the European Community, the assembly of vehicles is quite flexible regarding the origin of car components,
due to the internal market. For a single model of motor vehicle, a specific part may originate from one of several countries.
The U.S. proposal will therefore have greater administrative costs on European importers than other importers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EC is seriously concerned that such a proposal will create unnecessary trade barriers. Should the U.S. rules be
adopted as proposed, this would put an excessive financial burden on importers to access the U.S. market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. proposal may involve the disclosure of confidential data from manufacturers other than U.S. manufacturers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consequence, since the U.S. authorities, in accordance with Article 2.1 of the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers
to Trade, have an obligation to ensure that technical regulations are not prepared with a view to creating unnecessary
obstacles to international trade, the European Community requests the U.S. authorities to take the above comments
into account and adapt their proposal accordingly.

As discussed in the NPRM, NHTSA does not believe that section 210 contravenes the spirit or letter of GATT for the simple
reason that it is informational in nature, and has no other effect. Violations of GATT occur when barriers to trade
are established by raising tariffs on selected countries, or by granting preferences to local goods over foreign
goods. Under section 210, no tariffs are levied and no preferences are given to vehicles based on the U.S./Canadian
content. No quotas are established, and no vehicle is forbidden to be sold in the U.S. The only effect of section 210
is to provide consumers information about the origin of the equipment in vehicles they are considering purchasing.
If a consumer is not concerned with the country of origin of a vehicle's equipment, the label will have no bearing on
the purchasing decision whatsoever. If, on the other hand, a purchaser wishes to buy a vehicle that is comprised of
equipment from the U.S./Canada, Germany, England, Japan, Korea, or some other country, the label will give that consumer
information needed to help make such a decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the EC's concern about administrative costs for European manufacturers, NHTSA notes that since the
requirements imposed by the rule are strictly informational and do not require any product changes other than the
addition of a label, the costs for all manufacturers are small. The agency also observes that, as discussed above,
it made some changes in the final rule to provide greater flexibility, and hence reduced costs, for manufacturers.

The conferees also note the reasons that the percentage of USA and Canadian content value required to be listed in this
bill is combined. The conferees believe it is appropriate to make this new labeling requirement as consistent as possible
with existing laws and regulations. The conferees also do not want this legislation to increase the cost of automobiles
to consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conferees also recognize that the USA and Canada have a longstanding and specific automobile free trade pact (the
US and Canada Automotive Parts Agreement), one that predates the USA-Canada Free Trade Agreement by over 20 years.
This special relationship in automotive trade, and other factors, justify listing both US and Canadian automobile
value as a combined percentage. The conferees do not intend that any other country is to be combined with the USA and
Canada in the percentage of total automotive value required to be listed by this legislation.

7. Consumer Guide
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AIADA stated that it believes the labeling law will be misleading and confusing for consumers, and that the dealer
will ultimately bear the burden and be in the difficult position of explaining what it believes to be illogical content
information. That organization stated that to aid dealers and consumers, it believes NHTSA should publish and make
publicly available a consumer guide that explains just what the content figures represent and do not represent. It
stated, for example, that the guide should explain the distinction between allied and outside suppliers and how that
affects the value of motor vehicle content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that a consumer guide that attempted to explain the details of the content calculation procedures,
such as the distinction between allied and outside suppliers, would not be helpful to consumers but would instead
cause unnecessary confusion. NHTSA believes that the vehicle labels required by this final rule will be readily understood
by consumers and help those that wish to do so to take content information into account in making a purchase decision.

L. May 1994 Congressional Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In May 1994, NHTSA received a letter concerning this rulemaking signed by Senator Carl Levin and Representatives
Sander Levin, Marcy Kaptur and Nancy Johnson. The agency was also advised by phone that Representative Ralph Regula
supported the letter. The letter reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We are writing to urge you to draft American Automobile Labeling Act implementing regulations that reflect the legislation's
intent to provide an accurate means of measuring the parts value content of a vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trend has been for Japanese transplants to purchase parts assembled in the U.S. by Japanese affiliated parts makers,
a high percentage of which are merely assembled here using subcomponents and materials imported from Japan. Nonetheless,
they are erroneously counted as U.S. parts for the purposes of calculating U.S. content levels. The Labeling Act was
an attempt by Congress to establish a tool to more accurately measure the ``actual'' U.S. and Canadian content of vehicles
sold in the U.S. based on the origin of where the parts are made, not where the parts are purchased or assembled. It is
our hope that the Labeling Act will achieve this objective by imposing a stringent definition of what is an ``American
or Canadian made'' auto part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Japanese transplant auto makers claim high levels of U.S. content in their U.S. made vehicles. But they
will not provide the necessary data to measure accurately the U.S. content levels of the auto parts used in these vehicles,
and thus, it is impossible to verify their claims. After tracing the actual source of parts, a 1992 Economic Strategy
Institute study found that the U.S. auto part used in a 1991 Honda accord contained 2/3 Japanese content and only 1/3
``actual'' U.S. content. Even with these low levels of U.S. content, Honda took credit for these parts being totally
U.S.-made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to adequately distinguish between parts assembled in the U.S. using imported materials and parts made in
the U.S. using U.S. materials, the Labeling Act must include tracing requirements similar to the tracing requirements
in the NAFTA rule of origin, with the exception that Mexican parts would not be included as U.S. or Canadian. Tracing
should be used to determine if suppliers can be designated as North America (U.S. or Canadian)_if they achieve the
70% North American content value_as well as to determine the country of origin for the engine and transmission. For
example, if tracing were required, an engine or transmission that contains 75% Japanese content but is assembled
in the U.S. would be correctly found to be primarily of Japanese origin, not of U.S. origin.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Labeling Act requires that the names of all countries supplying 15% or more total parts value be listed.
To be meaningful, this requirement should not only include the name of the country, but also the approximate percentages
those countries contribute *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA notes that it is addressing this comment here in this separate section instead of addressing it in each of the
several relevant sections earlier in this preamble, since this approach is simpler and since the comment was received
near the end of the preparation of the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that today's final rule adequately distinguishes between parts assembled in the U.S. using imported
materials and parts made in the U.S. using U.S. materials. For purposes of calculating item one of the label, the percentage
U.S./Canadian parts content for vehicles within the carline, tracing is required to the extent that a supplier claims
that an item of equipment is U.S./Canadian. An outside supplier cannot designate a part as U.S./Canadian unless it
determines, on the basis of tracing the part's materials back to the raw material stage, that at least 70 percent of
the cost of the part represents value added in the U.S. or Canada. This is true for all items of equipment, including
engines and transmissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures for making country of origin determinations for purposes of items four and five of the label, countries
of origin for the engine and transmission, do not require tracing back to raw materials. However, country of origin
determinations must be made for each component delivered to the engine or transmission assembly plant (or produced
at such plant), and the cost of assembling the engine or transmission is not considered in making such determinations.
Therefore, engines and transmissions that are assembled in the U.S. largely of imported materials will not be determined
to be of U.S. origin under the procedures. As discussed above, the label will indicate that these country of origin
determinations are for ``engine parts'' and ``transmission parts,'' to make it clear to consumers that these country
of origin determinations exclude assembly costs. NHTSA does not believe that it would be appropriate to impose additional
tracing requirements, since such requirements could be very burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the foreign countries which contribute 15 percent or more parts content for vehicle within a carline, manufacturers
are required to list not only the names of those countries, but also the specific percentage originating in each such
country. If there are more than two such countries, the manufacturer need only provide the information for the two
countries with the highest percentages.

V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This action
has been determined to be ``significant'' under the Department's regulatory policies and procedures, given the
degree of public interest and the relationship to other Federal programs and agencies, particularly those related
to international trade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has estimated the costs associated with the rule in a Final Regulatory Evaluation which is being placed in the
docket for this rulemaking. That document analyzes the comments concerning costs. The requirements imposed by the
rule are strictly informational and do not require any product changes other than the addition of a label. NHTSA estimates
the cost of a separate label to be $0.06 to $0.11, and the cost of expanding a Monroney or fuel economy label to be less
than $0.01. The total cost for labels for the estimated 14 million vehicles sold in the U.S. annually that are affected
by the rule would therefore range from $140,000 to $1,540,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on manufacturers' comments, NHTSA estimates that a one-time cost to implement a system to collect and store
the necessary information for the labels is about $1 million apiece for the three large domestic manufacturers, and
$500,000 apiece for 20 other large vehicle manufacturers. Ford estimated annual maintenance costs of $150,000.
The agency assumes that this figure is reasonable for the three large domestic manufacturers, and that the other large
manufacturers will experience annual costs of about $75,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above cost estimates do not include the compliance costs for suppliers. NHTSA has limited information concerning
the costs that will be experienced by the approximately 15,000 parts suppliers to the vehicle manufacturing industry.
Some large suppliers (e.g., Rockwell, Dana Corp., or TRW) make hundreds of parts and could experience costs similar
to those of a large vehicle manufacturer. Many small suppliers procure all of their inputs from the same country and
will experience negligible costs. NHTSA notes that APMA estimated that parts manufacturers will experience costs
ranging from $40,000 to $80,000 in the first year, with a reduction in successive years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final stage manufacturers will experience only minor costs, since they only need to provide labels showing the final
assembly point and the country of origin for the engine and transmission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has considered the impact this rulemaking will have on small
entities. I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this action. Although certain small businesses,
such as parts suppliers and some vehicle manufacturers, are affected by the regulation, the effect on them is minor
since the requirements are informational.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has analyzed the environmental impacts of the regulation in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and has concluded that it will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Requests for information and certifications relevant to information on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each manufacturer and allied supplier shall request its suppliers to provide directly to it the information and
certifications specified by this part which are necessary for the manufacturer/allied supplier to carry out its
responsibilities under this part. The information shall be requested sufficiently early to enable the manufacturer
to meet the timing requirements specified by this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The requester shall indicate that the request is being made pursuant to 49 CFR part 583, and that the regulation
is administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The requester shall indicate that 49 CFR part 583 requires outside suppliers to provide specified information
upon the request of a manufacturer or allied supplier to which it supplies passenger motor vehicle equipment and that,
to the best of the requester's knowledge, the outside supplier is required to provide the requested information;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If any information other than that required by 49 CFR Part 583 is requested, the requester shall indicate which
information is required by 49 CFR part 583 and which is not; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The requester shall indicate that 49 CFR part 583 specifies that while information may be requested by an earlier
date, the outside supplier is not required to provide the information until the date specified by the requester or
the date 45 days after receipt of the request, whichever is later.

Procedure for determining U.S./Canadian parts content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in &sect;583.5 (f) and (g), shall determine the percentage U.S./Canadian
Parts Content for each carline on a model year basis, before the beginning of each model year. Items of equipment produced
at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied
by an allied supplier. All value otherwise added at the final assembly point and beyond, including all final assembly
costs, are excluded from the calculation of U.S./Canadian parts content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Determining the value of items of equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For items of equipment received at the final assembly point, the value is the price paid by the manufacturer for
the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly), the value is the
fair market price that a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For items of equipment received at the factory or plant of an allied supplier, the value is the price paid by the allied
supplier for the equipment as delivered to its factory or plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items of equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Equipment supplied by an outside supplier to a manufacturer or allied supplier is considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if 70 percent or more of its value is added in the United States or Canada; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 0 percent U.S./Canadian, if less than 70 percent of its value is added in the United States or Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The extent to which an item of equipment supplied by an allied supplier is considered U.S./Canadian is determined
by dividing the value added in the United States and Canada by the total value of the equipment. The resulting number
is multiplied by 100 to determine the percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) In determining the value added in the United States and Canada of equipment supplied by an allied supplier, any
equipment that is delivered to the allied supplier by an outside supplier and is incorporated into the allied supplier's
equipment, is considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if at least 70 percent of its value is added in the United States or Canada; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 0 percent U.S./Canadian, if less than 70 percent of its value is added in the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the
supplier produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial
boundaries of the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or
assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted
from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly plant) of the equipment. Except as provided in (c)(3),
material is considered foreign to whatever extent part or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent
value added in the United States or Canada, traced back to raw materials. For any material which is imported into the
United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the
material originated in the United States or Canada. Neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value
added in the United States or Canada backwards; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to
value added in the United States or Canada is considered foreign. Example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A supplier located in the United States or Canada uses sheet steel to produce exterior panels which are shipped to a
final assembly plant. In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of the exterior panels, the supplier
must subtract the price it paid for the sheet steel except to the extent that the supplier determines that the price
paid represents value added in the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the minor items listed in the &sect;583.4 definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being
excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their
equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States
or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of its material originated
in the United States or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States or Canada.

(5) If a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or more of its suppliers concerning
the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered zero.
This provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information
from their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.

 The percentage of the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is U.S./Canadian is determined
by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adding the total value of all of the equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected to be installed in that
carline during the next model year;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in &sect;583.5 (f) and (g), shall determine the countries, if any, which
are major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment and the percentages attributable to each such country
for each carline on a model year basis, before the beginning of each model year. The manufacturer need only determine
this information for the two such countries with the highest percentages. Items of equipment produced at the final
assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied by an allied
supplier. In making determinations under this section, the U.S. and Canada are treated together as if they were one
(non-foreign) country.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determining the value of items of equipment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The value of each item of equipment is determined in the manner specified in &sect;583.6(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determining the country of origin of items of equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each item of equipment is the country which contributes the
greatest amount of value added to that item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its
option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology
is employed for all items of equipment, and the U.S. and Canada are treated together.

(d) Determination of the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable
to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The percentage of the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is attributable to each country
other than the U.S. and Canada is determined on a model year basis by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adding up the total value of all of the passenger motor vehicle equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected
to be installed in that carline during the next model year;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Adding up the value of such equipment which originated in each country other than the U.S. or Canada;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Dividing the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for each country by the amount calculated in
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and multiplying each result by 100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A country is a major foreign source of passenger motor vehicle equipment for a carline only if the country is one
other than the U.S. or Canada and if 15 or more percent of the total value of the carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment
is attributable to the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each supplier of an engine or transmission shall determine the country of origin once a year for each engine and
transmission. The origin of engines shall be calculated for engines of the same displacement produced at the same
plant. The origin for transmissions shall be calculated for transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant.
Transmissions are of the same type if they have the same attributes including: Drive line application, number of forward
gears, controls, and layout. The U.S. and Canada are treated separately in making such determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The value of an engine or transmission is determined by adding up the prices paid by the manufacturer of the engine/transmission
for each component comprising the engine/ transmission, as delivered to the assembly plant of the engine/transmission,
and the fair market value of each individual part produced at the plant. All value added at the engine/transmission
plant is otherwise excluded from the calculation of origin. Individual parts refers to the most basic level of parts
used to assemble an engine or transmission and not subassemblies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each component is the country which contributes the greatest
amount of value added to that item. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its
option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology
is employed for all components.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Determination of the total value of an engine/transmission which is attributable to individual countries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The value of an engine/transmission that is attributable to each country is determined by adding up the total value
of all of the components installed in that engine/transmission which originated in that country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The country of origin of each engine and the country of origin of each transmission is the country which contributes
the greatest amount of value added to that item of equipment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale
Model ATR42 series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to determine the model and orientation of
certain flight control rods, and replacement with modified rods, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports
of corrosion found on the pitch trim and rudder trim rods. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
problems associated with corrosion of the flight control rods, which could compromise the required strength of these
items.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42 series airplanes.
The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes.
(This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted as a part of a sampling program carried out by the
manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by water accumulating in the lower part of the rods
and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards),
which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated
with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0071, dated February 23, 1994, describes procedures for inspecting the
elevator trim rod and rudder trim rod to determine the orientation of the open rod end. It also describes procedures
for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards.
A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation of water between the internal and external tubes of the
rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness
Directive 94&hyph;003&hyph;053(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0048, Revision 2, dated May 16, 1991, describes procedures for reversing
the installation of the ends of the elevator tab and rudder tab control rods so that the open end of the rod is oriented
downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0049, Revision 2, dated May 16, 1991, describes procedures for replacing
the elevator tab and rudder tab control rods with new rods that have been modified by the addition of a drain hole in the
non-open end of the rod and the application of a protective treatment. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin
as ``recommended.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the orientation
of the end of rudder trim and elevator trim fail-safe rods, and replacement of those rods having downwards-oriented
ends. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airplanes on which Aerospatiale Modification 02723 has been installed are not affected by the requirements of this
proposed AD. The subject flight control rods on those airplanes have been modified prior to airplane delivery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
4 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection action, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $28,160,
or $220 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any
of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if
this AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should replacement of any of the flight control rods be necessary, the number of work hours and the cost of required
parts would vary according to the type of replacement accomplished. In a ``worst case scenario'' (both subject rods
needing replacement), the cost of parts would be approximately $6,000 per airplane. Labor necessary to accomplish
replacement of a rod(s) would vary from 54 work hours to 87 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;30F series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of cargo
door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H&hyph;11 steel with Inconel bolts. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a broken latch spool fitting attach bolt found on a cargo door on a Model DC&hyph;9 series freighter airplane.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent opening of a cargo door while the airplane
is in flight, and subsequent loss of pressurization and reduced controllability of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 26, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;6991 (56 FR 21268), applicable to McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, manufacturer's fuselage numbers 1 through 379 inclusive. That AD requires
inspection of the cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H&hyph;11 steel and replacement of
those bolts with Inconel bolts. That action was prompted by a report of a broken latch spool fitting attach bolt found
on a cargo door on a Model DC&hyph;9 series freighter airplane. Broken bolts could jeopardize the integrity of the
door locking capability. The requirements of AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07 are intended to prevent loss of pressurization
and reduced controllability of the aircraft due to inadvertent opening of a cargo door while the airplane is in flight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07, the manufacturer has informed the FAA that cargo door latch spool fitting
attach bolts fabricated from H&hyph;11 steel also were installed on 8 additional Model DC&hyph;10 production airplanes.
Therefore, these 8 airplanes are subject to the same unsafe condition as addressed by that AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Alert Service Bulletin A52&hyph;212, Revision 4,
dated November 3, 1993, that describes procedures for replacement of the H&hyph;11 cargo door latch spool fitting
attach bolts and associated hardware with Inconel bolts and associated hardware. Replacing the existing H&hyph;11
material bolts and associated hardware with new bolts made from Inconel material and associated hardware will eliminate
the possibility of stress corrosion failures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require replacement of H&hyph;11 cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts with Inconel
bolts on 8 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;30 and &hyph;30F series airplanes. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA's normal policy is that, when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the
``old'' AD is superseded by being removed from the system and a new AD added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally
would have proposed superseding AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07 to expand its applicability to include the 8 additional airplanes.
However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by such a supersedure action, and the consequent
workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach
is to issue a separate AD applicable only to the 8 airplanes. This AD does not supersede AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07; airplanes
listed in the applicability of AD 91&hyph;10&hyph;07 continue to be required to comply with the requirements of that
AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and would be applicable only to eight airplanes listed in the alert service
bulletin described above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are 8 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that
6 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 86 work hours per
airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would
cost approximately $10,682 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $92,472, or $15,412 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas
Helicopter Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369 and OH&hyph;6A series helicopters equipped with certain
main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies or certain M/R hub lead-lag assemblies, that currently requires repetitive inspections
and checks for cracks. This action would require the same inspections as the superseded AD, but would eliminate pilot
checks, expand the areas of inspection, and require the application of slippage marks on each M/R blade root fitting
lug and related bushings to detect movement. This proposal is prompted by additional reports of cracks in the M/R blade
root fittings, lugs, and adjacent blade skin, and movement of the root fitting bushings. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a
M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 8, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8003 (56 FR 42230, August 27, 1991), to
require initial and repetitive inspections and checks of certain main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies and M/R hub lead-lag
link assemblies for fatigue cracks and for loose bushings in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs (lead-lag lugs). That
action was prompted by two incidents involving a cracked M/R blade root fitting lug (root fitting lug). Bushing movement
in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs may have caused fatigue cracks in the lead lag link assemblies. The lead lag link
assembly attaches to the M/R blade. Any cracks in the lead lag link assembly, the M/R blade, the MR blade root fitting,
or any movement of the bushing, could create an unsafe condition. That condition, if not corrected, could result in
failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control
of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, additional incidents of cracks in the M/R blade root fitting (root fitting), and M/R
blade skin have been reported. Additionally, the manufacturer has discovered that in some M/R blade assemblies,
the M/R blade root fitting bushing (bushing) can loosen and contribute to fretting-induced fatigue cracking in the
root fitting lug. The root fittings and M/R blade skins are parts of the M/R blade assembly. Therefore, McDonnell Douglas
Helicopter Company issued a revised Service Information Notice No. HN&hyph;211.4, DN&hyph;51.6, EN&hyph;42.4,
and FN&hyph;31.4 (SIN), dated January 27, 1993, that requested operators mark each root fitting lug and bushing with
a slippage mark and thereafter inspect for slippage on each root fitting lug and bushing. The revised SIN, dated January
27, 1993, includes the M/R blade assembly and M/R hub lead-lag link assembly inspections contained in the preceding

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04 to require application of a slippage mark on each root
fitting lug and bushing within 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In addition, this proposal would require, within
25 hours' TIS after the effective date of this AD and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours' TIS, that the M/R
blade assembly be removed and that the root fittings, root fitting lugs, lead-lag lugs, the M/R blade skin, and the
doublers adjacent to the root fitting be inspected for cracks. This AD proposal also requires that the bushings be
inspected for looseness and slippage, and that slippage marks be applied if not already present. Visual inspections
of the exposed M/R blade skin, root fittings, root fitting lugs, and lead-lag lugs for cracks and inspection of the
bushing slippage marks for movement are also required at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS. The FAA no longer allows
pilots to perform checks such as those contained in AD 91&hyph;17&hyph;04, paragraph (b). Therefore, a pilot would
not be permitted to perform any of the proposed inspections in this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1,000 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 22 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is
$55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to
be &sect;1,210,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Alta
Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX. The development of a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) standard instrument
approach procedure (SIAP) to Runway (RWY) 15 has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal
is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the VOR RWY 15 SIAP at Alta Vista Ranch Airport,
Marfa, TX.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL, at Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX. The development of a VOR RWY 15
SIAP has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for aircraft executing the VOR RWY 15 SIAP at Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending
upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993,
and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference on 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The
Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend Restricted Areas R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B, and establish R&hyph;2303C at Fort
Huachuca, AZ. R&hyph;2303A would be amended to exclude the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport
from the restricted area and provide airspace for visual flight rules (VFR) access to the airport when R&hyph;2303A
is in use. The proposal would lower the floor and ceiling and revise the lateral dimensions of R&hyph;2303B in order
to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. R&hyph;2303B would be further subdivided by redesignating
the southeast corner of the existing area as a separate restricted area, R&hyph;2303C. Additionally this notice
proposes to reduce the published hours of operation for R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B. As proposed, the time of designation
for the new area, R&hyph;2303C, would be intermittent by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). These changes are proposed to
accommodate increased training requirements and to return unneeded special use airspace to the National Airspace
System (NAS).

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to amend R&hyph;2303A
to exclude from the restricted area the airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL), within a 3-nautical-mile
radius of the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport. The airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet
AGL within 1-nautical-mile either side of U.S. Highway 90 would also be excluded. This would provide VFR access to
the airport when R&hyph;2303A is in use. R&hyph;2303B would be amended by relocating the northern boundary 3 miles
south of its existing position. This would better accommodate hang gliding activity that takes place just outside
of the northwest corner of existing R&hyph;2303B. R&hyph;2303B would also be subdivided to designate the southeastern
section as a separate restricted area, R&hyph;2303C. This notice also proposes to lower the floor of R&hyph;2303B
from 15,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL in order to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. The ceiling
of R&hyph;2303B would be lowered from FL 450 to FL 300. This new subarea would extend from 8,000 feet mean sea level (MSL)
to FL 300. The U.S. Army has determined that there is no longer a requirement for restricted airspace above FL 300, therefore,
that airspace would be returned to the NAS. Lastly, the times of designation for R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B would
be reduced from ``Monday-Saturday, 0700&hyph;1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance,''
to ``Monday-Friday, 0700&hyph;1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance.'' Activation of
R&hyph;2303C would be intermittent by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance. Designation of R&hyph;2303C is proposed
to accommodate hang gliding activities that occur just outside of the southeastern corner of existing R&hyph;2303B.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Section 73.23 of part 73 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a proposed rule that appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379). The document proposed to revise the guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of
raw fruit, vegetables, and fish; revise the definition for compliance with respect to adherence by retailers to those
guidelines; and revise the labeling values for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. Certain
portions of section VII. C and section VIII. in the Supplementary Information section were inadvertently omitted
from the document. This document corrects that error.

* * * signs normally would have been replaced during the compliance period. However, FDA does not believe that signs
normally would have been redesigned during that period. Therefore, the costs of the proposed regulation are administrative
and redesign costs. FDA estimates that the average cost of redesigning signs to label raw fruits, vegetables, and
fish is $100 per store. There are 31,000 chain stores and 68,000 independent grocery stores that fall under the compliance
guidelines. Therefore, if those stores currently complying with the guidelines continue to do so, costs of compliance
would be approximately $7.5 million.

 Under the act, FDA is scheduled to do a compliance survey every 2 years. The first survey was conducted in November and
December of 1992, and the second is scheduled for the fall of 1994. While FDA would like to have the new values in place
by the fall, the agency recognizes that it is unlikely that it will be able to do so. Even if the agency were to complete
this rulemaking by that time, FDA recognizes that it will be very difficult for firms to have signs in place that reflect
the new values by the time of the survey. Therefore, FDA advises that regardless of whether it completes this rulemaking
by the fall or not, it intends to find a store to be in compliance if it is providing nutrition information for raw fruits,
vegetables, and fish in accordance *&blank;*&blank;*.

A. Emissions Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inventory was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment
area ozone SIP for the Detroit/Ann Arbor area in Michigan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed analysis of Michigan's 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory SIP submittal is contained in the USEPA's technical
support document (TSD), dated January 27, 1994 from Jeanette Marrero to the Docket, entitled ``TSD for Proposed Revision
to Michigan's Ozone SIP for the 1990 Base Year Emissions Inventory for Areas Designated Nonattainment for Ozone''
(Emission Inventory TSD), which is available from the Region 5 office listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing to NAAQS nonattainment, to track
these emissions over time, and to ensure that control strategies are being implemented that reduce emissions and
move areas towards attainment. The Act requires ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate, serious, severe,
and extreme to submit a plan within 3 years of 1990 to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions by 15 percent
within 6 years after 1990. The baseline level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined
by adjusting the base year inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable
towards the 15 percent. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary inventory from which the periodic inventory,
the reasonable further progress (RFP) projection inventory, and the modeling inventory are derived. Further information
on these inventories and their purpose can be found in the ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone SIP,'' USEPA,
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991. The base
year inventory may also serve as part of statewide inventories for purposes of regional modeling in transport areas.
The base year inventory plays an important role in modeling demonstrations for areas classified as moderate and above
outside transport regions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air quality planning requirements for marginal to extreme ozone nonattainment areas are set out in section 182(a)&hyph;(e)
of title I of the Act. Further, the USEPA has issued a General Preamble describing USEPA's preliminary views on how
USEPA intends to review SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including requirements for the preparation
of the 1990 base year inventory (57 FR 13502, April 16, 1992 and 57 FR 18070, April 28, 1992). Because USEPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action
on the Michigan ozone base year emissions inventory, USEPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into
consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, USEPA will consider any comments submitted within the
comment period before taking final action on this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal to extreme are required under section
182(a)(1) of the Act to submit a final, comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone season, weekday
emissions from all sources within 2 years of enactment (November 15, 1992). This inventory is for calendar year 1990
and is denoted as the base year inventory. It includes both anthropogenic and biogenic sources of volatile organic
compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and carbon monoxide (CO). The inventory is to address actual VOC, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and CO emissions for the area during peak ozone season, which is generally comprised of the summer months. All stationary
point and area sources, as well as highway mobile sources within the nonattainment area, are to be included in the compilation.
Available guidance for preparing emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16,
1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inventory was submitted by the State to USEPA on January 5, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. The State of Michigan
held a public hearing on August 2, 1993 to receive public comment on the 1990 base year emission inventory for Detroit/Ann
Arbor nonattainment areas and certified the hearing to the USEPA in a submittal on November 15, 1993. Supplemental
information was also submitted on November 29, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission inventory was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 51, appendix V, as amended by 57
FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete on March 16, 1993 with the exception of evidence of
a public hearing. After receiving evidence of the public hearing, a letter from David Kee, Director, Air and Radiation
Division, USEPA, Region 5, dated January 7, 1994 was sent to the Governor's designee indicating the completeness
of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Review of State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When reviewing the final inventory, USEPA used the Level I, II, and III, ozone nonattainment inventory quality review
checklists provided by the OAQPS to determine the acceptance and approvability of the final emission inventory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Level I is essentially the initial level of broad review that USEPA performs in order to determine if the inventory
preparation guidance requirements found in the report ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone SIPs'' (EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;91&hyph;011)
have been met. The Level II review addresses completeness, procedures and consistency for each of the four general
source types in the inventory: stationary point and area sources, highway mobile sources, and non-highway mobile
sources. The data quality is also evaluated. Detailed Level I and II review procedures can be found in the following
document: ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories,'' USEPA, OAQPS, Research Triangle
Park, NC, July 27, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Level III review procedures are specified in a memorandum from J. David Mobley, Chief, Emissions Inventory Branch,
and G. T. Helms, Chief, Ozone/CO Programs Branch, to Air Branch Chiefs, Region I&hyph;X, ``1990 Ozone/CO SIP Emission
Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,'' October 7, 1992 and revised in a memorandum from John Seitz, Director,
OAQPS, to Regional Air Division Directors, Region I&hyph;X, ``Emission Inventory Issues,'' June 24, 1993. The Level
III review process is outlined here and consists of 10 points that the inventory must include. For a base year emission
inventory to be acceptable it must pass all of the following acceptance criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An approved Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) was provided and the Quality Assurance program contained in the IPP
was performed and its implementation documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Adequate documentation was provided that enabled the reviewer to determine the emission estimation procedures
and the data sources used to develop the inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The point source inventory must be complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current USEPA guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The area source inventory must be complete.

A detailed analysis of the Michigan I/M SIP submittal is contained in the USEPA's TSD, dated February 1, 1994 from Brad
Beeson to the Docket, entitled ``Technical Review of the Michigan SIP Submittal to Revise the I/M Program in Southeast
Michigan'' (I/M TSD), which is available from the Region 5 office listed above.

I. Background and Review Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Act requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B)(i)
requires States to submit SIP revisions for any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as marginal, pursuant
to section 181(a) of the Act, with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP prior to enactment of the Act, or any area
that was required by the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act) to have an I/M program, to bring the program up to
the level required in pre-1990 USEPA guidance, or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was
more stringent. Areas classified as moderate and worse ozone nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement
to improve programs to this level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted to the USEPA a revision to the Michigan
SIP which was intended to address the requirements for an I/M program in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The revision included
legislation which was signed into law by Governor Engler on November 13, 1993.

In addition to legislation revising the I/M program in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area, the State also submitted adopted
legislation establishing an I/M program on the west side of the State. For reasons of clarity, however, that program
will be the subject of a future 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time as this legislation was being developed, the MDNR was also in the process of developing a redesignation
request from nonattainment to attainment for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act states that an area can be redesignated to attainment if certain conditions are met.
One of these conditions is that the USEPA has fully approved the applicable implementation plan under section 110(k)
and that the State has met all applicable requirements of section 110 and part D. The USEPA's current approvability
criteria for I/M in part require fully adopted rules for all aspects of the proposed SIP revision. In addition, all
SIPs submitted must be subject to public hearing before they can be approved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), the USEPA published a final rule (I/M Rule) establishing I/M requirements pursuant
to section 182. On June 28, 1994 the USEPA published a proposal to amend requirements pertaining to SIP submissions
for areas required to implement a basic I/M program that submit, and otherwise qualify for approval of, a redesignation
request (``Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule''). The authority for that amendment is discussed in that proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to allow areas that have requested redesignation to attainment, and are otherwise
eligible to obtain approval of the request, to defer adoption and implementation of otherwise applicable requirements
established in the originally promulgated I/M rule. For such areas, the USEPA does not believe it is necessary to revise
or adopt new regulations which are not essential for clean air, and which would not be implemented after redesignation
occurred because they are not necessary for maintenance. The proposed rule applies only to areas that by virtue of
their air quality classification are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit and obtain approval
of a redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For such areas, the I/M Redesignation Rule proposes that the I/M component of the I/M SIP contain the following four
criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Legislative authority for basic I/M meeting all the requirements of subpart S such that implementing regulations
can be adopted without any further legislative action, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A provision in the SIP providing that basic I/M be placed in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance
plan upon redesignation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) a contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or his/her designee to adopt regulations to implement
the I/M program in response to a specified triggering event, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) a commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for the adoption and implementation of a basic I/M program
including appropriate milestones in the event the contingency measure is triggered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rulemaking, the USEPA is considering Michigan's I/M submittal based on the proposed I/M requirements for
areas otherwise eligible for redesignation. If the State's redesignation request is not otherwise eligible for
approval at the time the USEPA takes final action on it, or if the proposed I/M requirements for redesignation are not
codified, Michigan's submittal will be judged by the current I/M approvability criteria as detailed in the USEPA's
final I/M rule promulgated on November 5, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule, while the USEPA considers the redesignation request, the State
continues to be required to meet all the current SIP submission requirements including fully adopted rules and specific
implementation deadlines as required under 40 CFR &sect;51.372 of the I/M Rule. If the State does not comply with these
requirements, it could be subject to sanctions pursuant to section 179. If the redesignation request is approved,
any sanctions already imposed or any sanctions clock already triggered would be terminated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

On November 15, 1993 the State submitted a redesignation request including I/M as a contingency measure for the Detroit-Ann

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule criteria for areas redesignating from nonattainment to attainment, Michigan's
I/M SIP submittal for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area is acceptable. The State held public hearings on the State's submittal
February 14, 1994 in Detroit, Michigan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the first element of the four criteria, the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule requires ``legislative
authority for basic I/M such that implementing regulations can be adopted without any further legislative action.''
The legislation adopted by Michigan as a whole includes all the essential elements of a satisfactory basic I/M program.
The essential elements include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Describing the network type (``test and repair'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Listing of geographic coverage of program (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, and possibly Washtenaw if redesignated,
or Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, St. Clair, Livingston, and Monroe if not redesignated).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specifying the test type and procedure (idle test with BAR 90 equipment).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Listing of other applicable testing procedures (visual tampering inspection).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Defining subject vehicle population (1975 and later).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specifying testing frequency (every 12 months).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Granting authority to a State agency to develop necessary rules (MDNR).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establishing the enforceable obligation in the rule (persons shall not drive a motor vehicle without a valid
emissions certificate of compliance or waiver).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to defining the elements essential to the definition of an I/M program, the legislation grants the authority
to MDNR to develop the rest of the language necessary to make the program complete, including technical and administrative
details. No further legislative action is necessary to authorize or implement the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of redesignation, the USEPA believes that the States's approach to implement I/M in the counties of Wayne,
Oakland, Macomb, and Washtenaw counties is acceptable and meets the population requirements (geographic coverage)
specified in the I/M rule (40 CFR 51.350).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the State has authorized and provided the essentials of an I/M program in its adopted legislation, the first
element of the criteria proposed in the I/M Redesignation Rule is satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second element of the I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to require ``a provision in the SIP providing that basic
I/M be placed in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation.'' This requirement
is satisfied by the provision of section 8(2)(a) which requires a basic I/M program to be implemented as a contingency
measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third and fourth elements of the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule require an enforceable schedule and commitment
by the Governor or his/her designee for the adoption and implementation of a basic I/M program upon a specified, appropriate
triggering event. These elements are satisfied based on language submitted to the USEPA on November 15, 1993 under
separate cover, within the State's redesignation application. Section 6.8.3 of the State's Southeast Michigan
Redesignation TSD states ``implementation of the contingency measure[s] will be completed in a time-frame consistent
with schedules of implementation required for SIPs under title I of the Act and corresponding regulations.'' This
commitment was submitted to the USEPA on November 15, 1993 under the signature of Roland Harmes, the Governor's designee.
The USEPA assumes that the effective date of the basic I/M legislation as a contingency measure is the date that the
State determines that a basic I/M program is necessary, as shown by the urban airshed model (UAM), to correct a violation
of the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA further assumes that the basic I/M program will be implemented in the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area as a contingency measure 1 year from the effective date of the legislation as stipulated in the I/M rule 40 CFR 51.373(b).

While the USEPA is proposing approval of the State's I/M submittal based on the criteria proposed in the I/M Redesignation
Rule, if the State's redesignation request is not approved, or if the alternative approval criteria applicable to
redesignation is not codified as proposed, the State's submittal must be judged against the current I/M approvability
criteria which require fully adopted rules for all aspects of the program, as detailed in USEPA's final I/M rule of
promulgated on November 5, 1992. The State's submittal would then not be approvable because the submittal does not
include detailed rules, including cut points, test procedures and standards, quality control procedures, waiver
provisions, and program compliance and oversight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the State's submittal meets the I/M approvability criteria for areas redesignating from nonattainment
to attainment, USEPA is proposing to approve the I/M plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area that was submitted as a revision
to the Michigan SIP. Alternatively, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State's I/M SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area if the State's redesignation request is ultimately not approved or if the I/M Redesignation Rule is not codified
as proposed in USEPA's I/M rule before the USEPA finalizes its approval of the redesignation.

C. Redesignation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, nonattainment areas can be redesignated to attainment if sufficient data are available to warrant
such changes and the area satisfies other criteria contained in section 107(d)(3) of the Act. On November 12, 1993
the State submitted a redesignation request and section 175A maintenance plan. If approved, the section 175A maintenance
plan would become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed analysis of the Michigan Redesignation Request and section 175A Maintenance Plan SIP submittal for the
Detroit-Ann Arbor area is contained in the USEPA's TSD, dated February 24, 1994 from Jacqueline Nwia to the Docket,
entitled ``TSD for the Request to Redesignate the Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan Moderate Nonattainment Area to Attainment
for Ozone and the Proposed Revision to the Michigan Ozone SIP for a 175A Maintenance Plan'' and ``Amendments to the
February 24, 1994 TSD for the Request to Redesignate the Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan Moderate Nonattainment Area
to Attainment for Ozone and the Proposed Revision to the Michigan Ozone SIP for a 175A Maintenance Plan,'' dated June
21, 1994 (Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD), which are available from the Region 5 office listed above.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1977 Act required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure to meet the ozone NAAQS, to develop
SIPs with sufficient control measures to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. The Detroit-Ann Arbor
area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS (43 FR 8962, March
3, 1978 and 43 FR 45993, October 5, 1978).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After enactment of the amended Act on November 15, 1990 the nonattainment designation of the Detroit-Ann Arbor area
continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act; furthermore, it was classified by
operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991 and 57 FR 56762,
November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.323.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Detroit-Ann Arbor area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the ozone NAAQS, during
the period from 1991 through 1993. The area, therefore, became eligible for redesignation from nonattainment to
attainment consistent with the amended Act, and to ensure continued attainment of the ozone standard, Michigan also
submitted an ozone maintenance SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor on November 12, 1993. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 12, 1993 Michigan requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. On October
22, 1993 Michigan held a public hearing on the maintenance plan component of the redesignation request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments revised section 107(d)(3)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in
order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Michigan request is based on an analysis of quality-assured ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance
plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air ozone monitoring data for calendar year 1991 through calendar
year 1993
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 show an expected exceedance rate for the ozone standard of less than 1.0 per year of the ozone NAAQS in the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area (40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H). Because the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has complete quality-assured data showing
no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The State committed to continue monitoring
in this area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. (If, however, complete quality assured data shows violations of the
ozone NAAQS before the final USEPA action on this redesignation, the USEPA proposes that it disapprove the redesignation
request.)

The redesignation request documentation presents 1990&hyph;1992 ambient air quality monitoring data demonstrating
that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area attained the ozone NAAQS. In order to submit the redesignation request before November
15, 1993, Michigan prepared most of this documentation during the 1993 ozone season, when the 1993 ozone data was not
available. However, the USEPA reviewed the ambient monitoring data for 1993 contained in AIRS which demonstrates
that the area continues to attain the ozone NAAQS.

2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 6, 1980 (45 FR 29801) and February 7, 1985 (50 FR 5250), USEPA fully approved Michigan's SIP for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act with the exception that Michigan
must meet the part D RACT requirements for the ozone SIP. The 1990 Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under
part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation,
to satisfy the requirement that the SIP meet all applicable requirements under the 1990 Act, USEPA has reviewed the
SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the amended 1990 Act prior to or at the time Michigan submitted
its redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The USEPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean
that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject area
prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due
subsequently, continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates [see section 175A(c)] and, if the redesignation
of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A.) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 110 Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although section 110 was amended by the Act, the Detroit-Ann Arbor area SIP meets the requirements of amended section
110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, USEPA believes that the pre-amendment
SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended (57 FR 27936 and 23939, June 23, 1993) many are
duplicative of other requirements of the Act. The USEPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with
the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B.) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Part D Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before the Detroit-Ann Arbor area may be redesignated to attainment, it must have fulfilled the applicable requirements
of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1
of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well
as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified
under table 1 of section 181(a). As described in the General Preamble for the Implementation of title 1, specific requirements
of subpart 2 may override subpart 1's general provisions (57 FR 13501 (April 16, 1992)). The Detroit-Ann Arbor area
was classified as moderate (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991), codified at 40 CFR 81.323. Therefore, in order to be redesignated
to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c)
and 176 as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B1.) Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions. Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable
to all nonattainment areas. Under 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator,
but no later than 3 years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the amended Act. The USEPA has not
determined that these requirements are applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1993_the
date the State submitted a complete redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. Therefore, the State was
not required to meet these requirements for redesignation purposes. In addition, as discussed below, Michigan has
either satisfied the section 172(c) requirements or, as is the case for several of them, they lose their continued
force once an area has demonstrated attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) RFP is defined as progress that a nonattainment area must make each year toward attainment of the ozone NAAQS. This
requirement only has relevance during the time it takes an area to attain the NAAQS. Because the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area has attained the ozone NAAQS, its SIP has already achieved the necessary RFP toward that goal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition, because the Detroit-Ann Arbor has attained the ozone NAAQS and is no longer subject to an RFP requirement,
the section 172(c)(9) contingency measures are not applicable unless the redesignation request and maintenance
plan are not finally approved. Such contingency measures must take effect if the area fails to meet an RFP milestone
or fails to attain the ozone NAAQS; the Detroit-Ann Arbor area no longer has RFP milestones and has already attained
the NAAQS. However, section 175A contingency measures still apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Similarly, once an area is redesignated to attainment, nonattainment new source review (NSR) requirements are
not generally applicable. The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements
instead of the NSR program (57 FR 13564). The State has an acceptable program for review of new sources (45 FR 29790,
May 6, 1980 and 47 FR 3765, February 7, 1985). The PSD program was delegated to the State of Michigan on September 10,
1979 and amended on November 7, 1983 and September 26, 1988. Moreover, as discussed with respect to the NSR requirements
of part D, the USEPA believes that the applicability of the part C PSD program to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary
to require that an area have obtained full approval of the NSR revisions required by part D in order to be redesignated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The 172(c)(3) requirement for an emissions inventory has been met by submission and proposed approval of the 1990
base year emission inventory required by section 182(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No additional Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) controls beyond what may already be required in the
SIP are necessary upon redesignation to attainment. The General Preamble (57 FR 13560, April 16, 1992) explains that
section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of all RACM as
expeditiously as practicable. The EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to
consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for
implementation in the area as components of the areas attainment demonstration. Because attainment has been reached,
no additional measures are needed to provide for attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For purposes of redesignation, the Michigan SIP was reviewed to ensure that all requirements of section 110(a)(2),
containing general SIP elements, under the Act were satisfied. Title 40 CFR 52.1172 evidences that the Michigan SIP
was approved under section 110 of the Act, and further that it satisfies all part D, title I (as amended in 1977) requirements
on May 6, 1980 (45 FR 29801) and February 7, 1985 (50 FR 5250) with the exception that Michigan must meet the part D RACT
requirements for the ozone SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B2.) Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions. Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their
SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air
quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation
plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation
conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that
the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the
Act required the USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted on year after the date
for promulgation of the final USEPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's
General Preamble for the implementation of title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish
a submittal date [see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)]. The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity
regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214).
These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP
for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant
to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State
of Michigan is required to submit a SIP revisions containing transportation and general conformity criteria and
procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25 and 30, 1994, respectively. Because
the deadline for such submittals has not yet come due, it is not an applicable requirement, under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v),
for approval of this redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B3.) Subpart 2 Requirements. Detroit-Ann Arbor is a moderate ozone nonattainment area. Under subpart 2, as of the
date the State submitted a complete redesignation request, it is required to have met the requirements of section
182(a)(1), (2), and (3), section 182(b)(2), and (4), and section 182(f). The State has submitted SIP revisions which
have not yet been approved by the USEPA but must be in order to find that the State has met all the applicable requirements
of the following sections of the Act: Section 182(a)(1) 1990 base year emission inventory, section 182(a)(2)(A)
VOC RACT ``fix-ups,'' section 182(a)(2)(B) I/M fix-ups, section 182(b)(2) (``catch-ups'') VOC RACT for each VOC
source covered by a CTG issued between enactment of the Act and the attainment date (since the due date for these rules
is November 15, 1994 which has not come due yet, it is not a requirement for approval of this redesignation request),
all VOC sources covered by any CTG issued before the date of enactment of the Act, and all other major stationary sources
of VOC located in the area, section 182(b)(4) basic I/M, and section 182(f) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements. Section 182(b)(3) Stage II vapor recovery was also an applicable requirement. However, the ``onboard
rule''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was published on April 6, 1994 and section 202(a)(6) of the Act provides that once onboard rules are promulgated, Stage
II vapor recovery will no longer be a requirement. In addition, Michigan's emission statement program SIP submitted
to satisfy the section 182(a)(3)(B) requirement was fully approved in a final USEPA rulemaking on March 8, 1994 (59
FR 10752). The USEPA is proposing to approve this redesignation request notwithstanding the lack of fully-approved
provisions submitted in compliance with the NSR requirements of part D, section 182(b)(5) of the CAA. The USEPA believes,
as suggested by the General Preamble at 57 FR 13564 (April 16, 1992), that the applicability of the part C PSD program
to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary to require that an area have obtained full approval of NSR revisions required
by part D in order to be redesignated. The USEPA believes that this interpretation of the Act is appropriate notwithstanding
section 175A(d)'s requirements that the contingency provisions of a maintenance plan include a commitment on the
part of the State to implement all measures, to control the relevant air pollutant, that were contained in the SIP prior
to redesignation. The term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and it appears that Congress utilized the
terms ``measure'' or ``control measure'' differently in different provisions of the CAA that concern the PSD and
NSR permitting programs.

The rule which was published by the USEPA on April 6, 1994 requires a vehicle based (onboard) system for the control
of vehicle refueling emissions. Gasoline vapors which are normally vented to the atmosphere, are captured in a carbon
canister and stored for later use by the vehicle's engine.

section 110(a)(2)(A) and (C) with section 161. In light of this ambiguity in the use of the term ``measure,'' the USEPA
believes that the term ``measure'' as used in section 175A(d) may be interpreted so as not to include NSR permitting
programs. That this is an appropriate interpretation is further supported by USEPA's historical practice dating
back even before the 1990 CAA, of not requiring redesignating areas to demonstrate through modeling or otherwise
a justification for replacing the nonattainment NSR program with the PSD program once an area was redesignated. Rather
the USEPA has historically allowed the NSR program to be automatically replaced by the PSD program upon redesignation.
Michigan has presented an adequate demonstration that the State has met all the requirements applicable to the area
under section 110 and part D. The final approval of this redesignation request is contingent on the final approval
of the SIP submittals as noted above. These requirements, their applicability and status are discussed in more detail
in the USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD.

In other sections of this action, USEPA is proposing approval of the 1990 base year emission inventory and basic I/M
(meeting the criteria of the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation Rule). The SIP submittals for satisfying the

Under the pre-amended Act, USEPA approved the Michigan SIP control strategy for the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment
area, satisfied that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable. Furthermore,
numerous Federal measures apply to the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The State provided a detailed discussion of the development
of the emission reductions of ozone precursors (VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from 1988&hyph;1993. The State attributed the improvement in air quality that led to attainment of the ozone NAAQS
to the federally enforceable Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control measures. The emission reductions achieved from 1988 through 1993 are 226 tons VOC (21 percent) and 45 tons
of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3.4 percent) per day. In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State demonstrated that point
source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn. This was accomplished by setting all
growth factors at a minimum value of 1.0 for 1990 and beyond. The USEPA finds that the combination of existing USEPA-approved
SIP and Federal measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reduction in ambient ozone levels that
have allowed the area to attain the NAAQS.

Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least 10 years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the State must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the 10 years following the initial 10-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. Section 175A(d)
requires that the contingency provisions include a requirement that the State will implement all control measures
that were contained in the SIP prior to redesignation as an attainment area. In this action, USEPA is proposing approval
of the State of Michigan's maintenance plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area because USEPA finds that Michigan's submittal
meets the requirements of section 175A provided that the State's contingency measures that were required as SIP revisions
prior to the submission of the redesignation request are fully approved. If USEPA determines after notice and comment
that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area will have a fully
approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A.

Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory.

 The State has adequately developed an attainment emission inventory for 1993 that identifies 790 tons of VOC and 1336
tons of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 per day as the level of emissions in the area sufficient to attain the ozone NAAQS. The 1993 attainment inventory was
based on the comprehensive inventories of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources for 1990. Consistent with emission inventory guidance, the
1990 base year emission inventory represents 1990 average summer day actual emissions for the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area. Since the projected 1993 emissions are lower than the actual 1990 emissions (providing a more stringent attainment
inventory) and 1993 is the attainment year, it is appropriate to utilize projected 1993 emissions for the attainment
year inventory. Furthermore, the 1990 base year emission inventory was prepared in accordance with USEPA guidance.
USEPA's TSDs prepared for the 1990 base year emission inventory (Emission Inventory TSD) SIP revision and the redesignation
request (Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD) contain more in-depth details regarding the emission inventories
for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 base year emission inventory also served as the basis for calculations to demonstrate maintenance by projecting
emissions forward to the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005. Projections are based on growth factors extracted from
the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments Regional Development Forecast (RDF). Supplemental information
used in the development of emission projections include source-specific data for electric utilities, automobile
manufacturing, aircraft, and gasoline marketing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Growth factors are derived from employment forecasts by two-digit Source Industrial Code by county. In addition,
product output data was used to develop growth factors for motor vehicle manufacturing, and utilities. The area source
growth factors used from RDF were based on population or housing data. Furthermore, all growth factors that were less
than 1.0 were set equal to 1.0 for 1990 and beyond to offset any effects of negative growth possibly due to economic downturns.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the mobile source emission estimates, the MOBILE5a model was used. The significant input parameters
for the MOBILE5a model are analyzed in detail in the Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stationary source emission estimates (point and area) were developed using the geocoded emissions modeling
and projections system (GEMAP). This emission projection model and supporting documentation were reviewed by Region
5 and the Emission Inventory Branch of the OAQPS during the developmental stages of the redesignation request and
appear to be acceptable since GEMAP employs methodologies equivalent to the applicable USEPA guidance on emission
projections (June 21, 1993 letter to John Schroeder and August 3, 1993 Record of Conversation with OAQPS, RADIAN and
Region 5).

the emission projections are conservative since they do not account for emission reductions that will result from
the anticipated implementation of other control measures and programs during this time period.

The emission projection methodologies used for the maintenance demonstration are the same as those used for the attainment
inventory and discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission projections show that the emissions are not expected to exceed the level of the base year 1993 inventory
during the 10-year maintenance period. Further emission reductions that will occur during this maintenance demonstration
that are not accounted for in the emission projections presented in the tables above such as title III maximum achievable
control technology for air toxics, and onboard refueling vapor recovery. The projected emission inventories were
prepared in accordance with USEPA guidance. Finally, USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD contains more
in-depth details regarding the projected emission inventories for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To demonstrate maintenance out to the year 2005 following redesignation, the State did not rely on certain SIP-approved
measures. The State now requests that these measures (discussed below) be moved from the applicable SIP into the maintenance
plan as contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has demonstrated maintenance without basic I/M, Stage I expansion

 RACT. The Act required a SIP submittal for these control measures prior to the submittal of the redesignation request,
and consequently, they are required to be fully adopted and fully approved into the SIP prior to or at the time of full
approval of the redesignation request. However, since the State has demonstrated attainment and maintenance without
these programs these measures can be incorporated into the area's maintenance plan as contingency measures (see,
e.g., September 17, 1993 Shapiro memorandum). The June 28, 1994 Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to allow
basic I/M to be included as a contingency measure in the form of enabling legislation. Stage I must be fully adopted
since it is a SIP element that was due prior to the submittal of the redesignation request. Stage II, however, does not
have to be fully adopted. In fact, since the ``onboard rule'' was published on April 6, 1994 Stage II is no longer a requirement
(section 202(a)(6) of the Act). However, if the State chooses to include this program as a contingency measure, enabling
legislation would suffice. Michigan has chosen to retain Stage II as a contingency measure in the maintenance plan.
Finally, the State submitted to USEPA a section 182(f) NO

 exemption petition based on 1991&hyph;1993 ambient air quality data that demonstrates that the area is attaining
the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA is currently taking action on this submittal. Since the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has demonstrated
that it can maintain the standard without the implementation of these programs, USEPA proposes that the maintenance
plan be approved with these elements as contingency measures. In addition, based on the maintenance demonstration,
the USEPA plans to propose approval of the basic I/M enabling legislation (based on the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation
Rule), and the Stage I rule and 182(f) NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area depends, in part, on the State's efforts toward
tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The tracking plan for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area consists of two components; continued ambient ozone monitoring and inventory updates. To demonstrate
ongoing compliance with the NAAQS, Michigan will continue to monitor ozone levels throughout the area. The State
will also conduct periodic inventories for the redesignated area every 3 years using the most recent emission factors,
models and methodologies. The inventories will begin in 1996 with completion of the 1996 inventory by July 1, 1998.
Periodic inventories for 1999, 2002, and 2005 will be completed with submittal to the USEPA on the first of October
2 years after the inventory year. The periodic inventory will consist of reviewing the assumptions of the maintenance
demonstration such as VMT, population, employment, etc. If substantial changes are discovered, the State will reproject
the emissions for the maintenance period.

The contingency plan contains only one trigger, a monitored air quality violation of the ozone NAAQS, as defined in

 emissions in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS
in the future. Despite best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient air pollutant
concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, as required by section 175A of the Act, Michigan has provided
contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future ozone air quality problem. Contingency
measures contained in the plan include basic I/M, NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT, Stage I expansion, Stage II, RVP reduction to 7.8 psi and intensified RACT for degreasing operations. In instances
where the contingency measures must be actually adopted and implemented, the schedules specified for these SIPs
in the Act and any corresponding regulations will be observed, with the exception of implementation of 7.8 RVP and
intensified degreasing rules which will commence 12 months after the decision to employ these measures. Once the
triggering event, a violation of the ozone NAAQS, is confirmed, the State will implement one or more appropriate contingency
measure. Selection of the contingency measure(s) will be based on a technical analysis using UAM. The Governor will
select the contingency measures within 6 months of a triggering event. The adoption and implementation schedules
for the selected contingency measure(s) will be submitted to the USEPA with the UAM analysis. The USEPA understands,
on the basis of the State's submission, that the adoption and implementation schedules specified in the Act and any
corresponding regulations would be observed; therefore, the following schedules will be applicable for the contingency
measures specified in the contingency plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1990 must implement Stage I within 6 months of the decision to employ Stage I as a contingency measure.
Existing facilities dispensing 100,000 gallons or more of gasoline a month must implement Stage I within 1 year and
facilities dispensing less than 100,000 gallons of gasoline a month must implement Stage I within 2 years of the decision
to employ Stage I as a contingency measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Stage II would be implemented according to the same schedule set forth for Stage I, since they are contained

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under separate cover, the State has submitted to the USEPA, as SIP revisions, fully adopted legislation allowing
implementation of a basic I/M program, Stage I, and Stage II in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The legislation provide
for implementation of these programs as contingency measures within areas redesignated to attainment for ozone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA finds that the five contingency measures provided in the State submittal meet the requirements of section
175A(d) of the Act since they would promptly correct any violation of the ozone NAAQS.

E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP 8 years after
the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional 10 years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA proposes to approve the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone maintenance plan as a SIP revision meeting the requirements
of section 175A if there is full and final approval of the outstanding VOC RACT requirements previously discussed,
1990 base year emission inventory, basic I/M (meeting the criteria of the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation
Rule), and the section 182(f) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption petition. In addition, the USEPA is proposing approval of the redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area, subject to final approval of the maintenance plan, because the State has demonstrated compliance with
the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation pending full approval of the SIP elements listed above.
(In the alternative, if ambient air quality violations occur before USEPA takes final action on the proposed redesignation
or if the USEPA does not fully approve any of the SIP revisions listed above, the USEPA proposes to disapprove this redesignation
request.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozone SIPs are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Act and to provide for attainment and maintenance
of the ozone NAAQS. This proposed redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the State to delete, alter,
or rescind any of the VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved ozone SIP. Changes to ozone SIP VOC regulations
rendering them less stringent than those contained in the USEPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan
for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by USEPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and
changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation [section 173(b) of the Act] and in a SIP deficiency call
made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act.

D. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future action will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order
12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222). The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table
3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued
in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Regulatory Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. section 603 and 604. Alternatively, the USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by September 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time
within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This
action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (section 307(b)(2).)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces its intent to delete the C&amp;J Disposal site from
the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this action. The NPL is Appendix B of the National
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State
of New York have determined that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate under CERCLA. Moreover,
EPA and the State have determined that CERCLA activities conducted at the C&amp;J Disposal site to date have been protective
of public health, welfare, and the environment.

EPA Region II announces its intent to delete the C&amp;J Disposal site from the NPL and requests public comment on this
action. The NPL is Appendix B to the NCP, which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of CERCLA, as amended. EPA identifies
sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL
as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substances
Superfund Response Trust Fund (the ``Fund''). Pursuant to Section 300.425 (e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from
the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions, if conditions at such site warrant action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will accept comments concerning the C&amp;J Disposal site for thirty (30) days after publication of this notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (until August 19, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the C&amp;J Disposal site meets the deletion criteria.

II. NPL Deletion Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria that the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR Section
300.425 (e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination,
EPA will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. That responsible or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented, and no further cleanup by responsible
parties is appropriate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking remedial measures is not appropriate.

III. Deletion Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP provides that EPA shall not delete a site from the NPL until the State in which the release was located has concurred,
and the public has been afforded an opportunity to comment on the proposed deletion. Deletion of a site from the NPL
does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist agency management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of the C&amp;J Disposal site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA Region II has recommended deletion and has prepared the relevant documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State of New York has concurred with the deletion decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concurrent with this Notice of Intent to Delete, a notice has been published in local newspapers and has been distributed
to appropriate federal, state and local officials, and other interested parties. This notice announces a thirty
(30) day public comment period on the deletion package starting on July 20, 1994 and concluding on August 19, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the regional office and the local site information repository.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Region II will accept and evaluate public comments and prepare a Responsiveness Summary which will address the
comments received, before a final decision is made. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on
notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community may be most pertinent to deletion decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after consideration of these comments, EPA decides to proceed with deletion, the EPA Regional Administrator
will place a Notice of Deletion in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary will
be made available to local residents by EPA Region II.

Site History and Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The C&amp;J Disposal site, located in the Town of Eaton, Madison County, New York, included a rectangular disposal
trench which measured approximately 140 feet by 40 feet. The disposal trench was situated between a former railroad
bed and an active agricultural field, and was on property immediately adjacent to residential property owned by C&amp;J
Leasing of Paterson, New Jersey. Approximately 100 feet south of where the trench was located is a small pond and adjacent
wetlands which drain to Woodman Pond, a back-up water supply for the Village of Hamilton. There are twelve residences
in the vicinity and downgradient of the site which use private wells as their source of drinking water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1970s, the trench area was used for the disposal of industrial wastes, although never licensed or permitted
for that purpose. In March 1976, C&amp;J Leasing was observed dumping what appeared to be paint sludges and other liquid
industrial waste materials into the trench. An inspection of the site by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) and the Village of Hamilton engineer revealed 75&hyph;100 drums lying in a pool of liquid waste.
The trench was subsequently covered with fill, reportedly by C&amp;J Leasing, apparently burying the drums observed
in March 1976. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling was conducted at the site by NYSDEC in 1985 and by EPA in 1986. Surficial soil samples obtained from the site
revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, phthalates, various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polynuclear
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lead. One of the phthalates, bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and elevated levels
of lead were detected in the sediments of the small pond. The sampling of local residential wells in 1986 and later in
1988, by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), did not detect any contaminants from the site.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The site was placed on the NPL in March 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1989, prior to the start of the RI/FS, the site was subject to an unauthorized excavation by the principals
of C&amp;J Leasing, leaving two large holes and three stockpiles of soil and waste material. The drums that were believed
to have been previously buried may have been removed at this time, or earlier, and taken off-site. An extensive follow-up
investigation failed to determine where the drums may have been taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1989, EPA initiated the RI/FS. Results from the RI indicated that the contaminants at the site were confined
to the waste disposal trench, with the exception of some low levels of contamination in the sediments of the small pond.
The total volume of waste material and contaminated soil and debris in the disposal trench was estimated at 1,250 cubic
yards (i.e., contained in the area of 140 feet by 40 feet and to a depth of 6 feet). The waste was determined to be non-uniformly
distributed and comprised of soil mixed with a light-colored, friable, plastic-like residue and/or a similar synthetic
matter, crushed drums and plastic bags (drum liners) contaminated with the same or similar plastic residue, and some
wood debris. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary contaminants found in the trench area were various phthalates (i.e., bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,
di-n-octylphthalate, and di-n-butylphthalate), phenols (i.e., 2,4-dimethyl phenol, and 4-methylphenol) and
VOCs (i.e., benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylenes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4-methyl-2-pentanone). Lead, which was found at elevated levels during limited testing by EPA in 1986, was detected
above background levels in only one sample during extensive RI sampling. Lead was also found at significantly elevated
levels during EPA's post-RI sampling in 1991. A wide variety of PAHs were also found in the disposal trench and in surrounding
surface soils. Since the PAHs were attributable to the old railroad bed (due to their association with products used
for railroad construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as where the PAHs were located at the site), they were
considered to be background. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some of the waste materials in the trench were in direct contact with the shallow ground water, the contaminants
were found to be bound in the waste material and/or adsorbed to the adjacent soils and, therefore, were not migrating
to the ground water from the trench. Extensive chemical analysis of the eight local residential wells (serving twelve
residences) during the RI confirmed the prior results (i.e., that no contaminants from the site had migrated to these
wells). Seven ground-water monitoring wells (four shallow and three deep), including one well in the center of the
trench, also indicated no migration of contaminants from the trench to the ground water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of the water in the small pond indicated no migration of soluble contaminants from the site. The low levels
of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and lead found in the sediments in the pond were attributable to overland soil transport
by surface-water runoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RI concluded that the potential for direct human and animal exposure, as well as the potential for future contaminant
migration to the ground water and surface water, existed at the site and there were no permanent controls in place to
prevent contaminant migration from the trench as a result of any deterioration or disturbance of the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following completion of the RI/FS, site security was upgraded by EPA. The upgrade included installing two locked
gates, additional fencing, and posting of warning signs to restrict access of unauthorized persons. Also at this
time, EPA performed additional sampling at the site, in preparation for the off-site disposal/treatment of the contaminated
soil and debris. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1991, a Record of Decision was signed, selecting as the remedy for the site the excavation and removal of
approximately 1,250 cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris, followed by its transportation to a permitted,
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-compliant waste management facility for treatment/disposal. The selected
remedy included backfilling the trench with clean soil, re-vegetating the area, and quarterly monitoring of the
ground water and downgradient residential wells for a period of one year. In addition, no remediation of the small
pond was necessary because of the insignificant amount of contaminants in the sediments and because of the adverse
impact excavation would have on the pond and its ecosystem.

Following the completion of the remedial design (RD) in August 1992, the remedial action (RA) commenced. Over the
course of the RA, which was completed in June 1993, over 2,400 cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris (i.e., 173
truckloads containing 3,514 tons of material) were removed from the site. No intact drums were encountered during
the excavation. Analysis of samples collected from monitoring wells located downgradient of the disposal trench
two weeks after backfilling the trench indicated no contaminants had migrated to the wells as a result of excavation
activities. Post-RA sampling by NYSDOH, as well as post-RA quarterly sampling by EPA, also indicated no contamination
migration to residential wells.

Summary of Community Relations Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overall, there has been moderate community interest shown with respect to activities at the site. Initially, interest
was high due to the unauthorized excavation at the site, reports of neighborhood children playing at the site, the
possibility of contaminated wells in the neighborhood, and the potential to pollute Woodman Pond (which, in part,
contributed to the Village of Hamilton's decision to install municipal wells instead of continuing to use Woodman
Pond for municipal drinking water). Interest in the site declined, however, when the testing and re-testing of local
residential wells indicated that no contaminants attributable to the site were present in local wells, visible improvements
were made in site security, and on-going contact was maintained with local officials and the community. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a public meeting on February 13, 1991, EPA presented the results of the RI/FS and identified the preferred remedial
alternative for the site. The remedy presented for the site was extremely well received since it satisfied the prior
requests of local officials and citizens for the complete removal of the chemicals at the site from their community.

There are no operation and maintenance requirements since all remediation activities have been completed. Because
the implemented remedy does not result in hazardous substances remaining on-site above health-based levels, the
five-year review does not apply.

Summary of How the Deletion Criteria Has Been Met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Residential well monitoring since 1986 has consistently indicated no contaminant migration to any of the local residential
wells from the site. RI and RD sampling results indicated no site-related contaminants in on- or off-site monitoring
wells. One year of post-RA quarterly sampling completed by EPA in January 1994 did not show any contaminants from the
site in either the on-site monitoring wells or the local residential wells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary pathways that threatened public health at the C&amp;J Disposal site were direct exposure and possible
ingestion of the chemicals at the site, as well as the possible future contamination of the ground water and local wells
and the impact to the local environment from deterioration or disturbance of the contaminated waste. The results
of the post-RA monitoring confirm that excavation and removal of the contaminants of concern from the C&amp;J Disposal
site renders both current and future pathways incomplete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and the State have determined that the response actions undertaken at the C&amp;J Disposal site are protective
of human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 40 CFR Section 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate.
EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that all appropriate responses under CERCLA have been implemented
and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Having met the deletion criteria, EPA proposes
to delete the C&amp;J Disposal site from the NPL.

those payment practices and business arrangements that will be protected from criminal prosecution and civil sanctions
under the anti-kickback provisions of the statute. This proposed rule would modify the original set of final safe
harbor provisions to give greater clarity to the rulemaking's original intent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 29, 1991, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a final rule setting forth various safe harbor provisions to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute (56
FR 35952). This regulation was authorized under section 14 of Public Law 100&hyph;93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient
and Program Protection Act of 1987. The final rule specified those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal
prosecution under section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b)), and that will
not provide a basis for exclusion from Medicare or the State health care programs under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act
(42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(b)(7)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the final rule, we have become aware of a limited number of ambiguities that have created uncertainties
for health care providers trying to comply with the safe harbor provisions. We have also become aware of certain instances
where our intent, either to protect or preclude protection for particular business arrangements, is not fully reflected
in the text of the regulation even though it is reflected in the preamble. This proposed rule would serve to modify the
text of the July 29, 1991 final rule to conform to the rulemaking's original intent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarifications contained in this proposed rule do not represent an attempt to reevaluate the wisdom of the original
safe-harbor decisions. Instead, the changes set forth in this proposed rule would serve only to protect business
practices originally intended to be protected by removing ambiguities in the regulatory language. This clarity
should aid the formation of legal business practices without establishing any new significant legal obligations
on the parties affected by the regulations.

II. Summary of the Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Clarification to the General Comments Section of Preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Several individuals have commented that the following sentence in the preamble has created confusion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Because the statute is broad, the payment practices described in these safe harbor provisions would be prohibited
by the statute but for their inclusion here.'' (56 FR 35958) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This sentence was not meant to imply that, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in all instances irrespective of the parties intent, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the government could prosecute conduct described in the regulation, but for its inclusion in the regulation. Whether
a particular payment practice violates the statute is a question that can only be resolved by an analysis of the elements
of the statute as applied to that set of facts. Generally speaking, however, the original final rule did describe payment
practices that would be prohibited, where the unlawful intent exists, but for the safe harbor protection that has
been granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In discussing the space and equipment rental and personal services and management contracts, we stated that
if a ``sham contract is entered into *&blank;*&blank;* we will look behind the contract'' to its substance in evaluating
whether the arrangement qualifies for safe-harbor protection (56 FR 35972). We received numerous inquiries as to
whether we would similarly look behind the form of other arrangements to determine whether the substance of the arrangement
fits within a particular safe harbor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, such inquiries have led us to clarify particular safe harbors, as is illustrated by the following discussions
of the safe harbors for investment interests, space and equipment rental, and personal services and management contracts.
However, because of the broad variety of transactions subject to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute
and the ability of individuals to manipulate the safe harbors in ways not contemplated, we believe that a general rule
preventing sham arrangements from receiving safe harbor protection would be appropriate. Thus, we are proposing
adding a new &sect;1001.954 to the regulations. Such an approach has several precedents. The Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) with the concurrence of the Department of Justice promulgated &sect;801.90 of the FTC's rules implementing
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (16 CFR 801.90), which disregards sham transactions entered
into for the purpose of avoiding obligations under the Act. In addition, other Federal agencies (such as the Securities
Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service) have promulgated regulations and policies that seek to protect
the government from making enforcement decisions based on information that does not accurately reflect the substance
of the transaction. (See, for example, 17 CFR 240.12b&hyph;20;

, TC Memo 1987&hyph;120; and Rev. Rul. 81&hyph;149, 1981&hyph;1 CB 77.) Moreover, the courts have historically disregarded
sham arrangements when examining the rights and obligations of the parties in tax cases. (See, for example,

&blank;Health Care Assets and Revenues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In qualifying for the ``large entity'' or ``small entity'' investment interest safe harbors, the monetary value
or amount of certain assets and revenues must be determined. Specifically, the safe harbors include: (1) The $50,000,000
asset threshold in &sect;1001.952(a)(1); and (2) the gross revenues in the ``60&hyph;40 revenue rule'' in &sect;1001.952(a)(2)(vi).
In these cases, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only the assets or revenues related to the furnishing of health care items or services will be counted for the purposes
of qualifying for these safe harbor requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It would be an obvious sham, inconsistent with our original intent, if a joint venture could merge with a non-health
care business and have those non-health care assets, and the revenues derived from that non-health care line of business
counted for the purposes of qualifying for safe harbor protection. We are thus proposing to revise these safe harbor
provisions to further clarify our original intent that only health care assets and revenues will be counted in determining
these values and amounts.

&blank;Acquisition of Investment Interests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As set forth in &sect;1001.952(a)(1)(ii), an ``interested'' investor (who is in a position to make or influence referrals
to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity) must obtain his or her investment
interest through trading on a registered national securities exchange on terms equally available to the public.
This does not mean that an interested investor may acquire his or her interest in any way other than the methods available
to the general public to acquire investment interests. We believe that the investor must acquire his or her investment
interest in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
same way
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as members of the public_directly off of a registered national securities exchange through a broker_and it must be
the same type of investment interest that is available to the public. For example, a transaction in which the interested
investor receives restricted or ``lettered'' stock from the entity would not be considered a valid acquisition of
investment interests under this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion above does not represent a change in this standard. Rather, it serves only to emphasize that the investment
interest ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
must be obtained
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on terms equally available to the public through trading on a registered national securities exchange *&blank;*&blank;*''
(&sect;1001.952(a)(1)(ii)) (Emphasis added). Moreover, to obtain an investment interest ``on terms equally available
to the public,'' there cannot be any side agreements that require stock to be purchased or that restrict in any manner
the investor's ability to dispose of the stock. Any such agreement would constitute a sham transaction which would
disqualify dividend payments to that investor from safe harbor protection.

&blank;Loans for the Purchase of the Investment Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the standards in the large and small entity investment interest safe harbors prohibits the entity from loaning
an investor funds that are used by the investor to purchase his or her investment interest. (See &sect;&sect;1001.952(a)(1)(iv)
and 1001.952(a)(2)(vii).) We are proposing to change this standard to prohibit other investors, individuals or
entities as well as the entity from making such loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

&blank;Class of Investment Interests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 60&hyph;40 investor rule in the small entity investment interest safe harbor (&sect;1001.952(a)(2)(i)),
we established two categories of investors: (1) ``untainted'' or ``disinterested'' investors are those who do no
business with the entity, but hold the investment interest purely as an investment; and (2) ``tainted'' or ``interested''
investors are those who are in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise
generate business for the entity. For purposes of determining in which category to place an investor, we require ``each
class of investments'' to meet the 60&hyph;40 apportionment between the two categories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have become aware of the difficulty in applying the 60&hyph;40 rule to each class of investors in a joint venture
where the general partners hold a separate class of stock or investment interest from the limited partners. In such
a situation, that class of investment interest for the general partners consists of 100 percent ``tainted'' or ``interested''
investors since the general partners are providing services to the entity. Therefore, we believe that the entire
joint venture does not qualify for safe harbor protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is not always true that an active investor holds a different class of investment interest from a passive investor,
we have found that it is unnecessarily restrictive to have this 60&hyph;40 investor rule only apply to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 class of investment interest. Thus, we are proposing to modify this first investment interest standard to allow an
alternative to the class-by-class analysis. The new alternative would allow equity investment interests to be combined
together or debt investment interests to be combined together (separate from the equity investments) for purposes
of apportioning investors into ``untainted'' and ``tainted'' pools and meeting the 60&hyph;40 test. Only equivalent
classes of equity investment interests could be combined, and only equivalent classes of debt investment interests
could be combined. That is, the classes of investment interests combined would have to be similar in all material respects.
For example, the classes to be combined would have to have equivalent returns in proportion to amounts invested. In
addition, if one class is given preferential treatment (e.g., in the case of disposition), such an interest could
not be combined with subservient interests for purposes of compliance with the 60&hyph;40 investor rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a limited partnership has a general partner who holds 20 percent of the value of the investment interests, referring
physicians hold 20 percent, and all the other investors have no business relationship with the partnerships, then
the 60&hyph;40 investor rule would be met, as long as all other requirements are satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 60&hyph;40 investor rule would not be met if any of the other disinterested investors in the above example holds
a debt instrument instead of an equity instrument. For example, if a joint venture raises one-third of its capital
through a debt instrument held by disinterested investors, with the remaining two thirds of its capital derived from
equity instruments held equally by interested (physicians and general partners) and disinterested investors,
the safe harbor would not be met. In this example, even though interested investors hold only one-third of all the investment
interests, they hold one-half of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
equity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
investment interests, and thus no safe harbor protection would be available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that other standards in this small entity safe harbor preclude protection for abusive schemes to give referring
investors preferential treatment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in any way 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by creating different classes of investment. For example, if a joint venture creates two classes of stock, with one
of the classes reserved for referring physicians who receive a higher dividend per share than non-referring investors
in the other class, such an arrangement would not comply with at least sections 1001.952(a)(2) (ii), (iii) and (viii).

&blank;Items or Services Furnished by an Investor
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, when an investor furnishes items or services to the joint venture, such as management services,
he or she is a tainted or interested investor for the purposes of complying with the 60&hyph;40 investor rule (&sect;1001.952(a)(2)(vi)).
It was not our intent to have any revenues that the joint venture derives from this investor's services to be considered
tainted for the purpose of qualifying for the 60&hyph;40 revenue rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the apparent confusion caused by the language ``items or services furnished'' in this safe harbor standard,
we are proposing striking it. The focus of the inquiry in this standard is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the business and clients are coming from. In other words, the revenues are tainted, and may not exceed 40 percent of
total revenues, if they are derived ``from referrals*&blank;*&blank;* or business otherwise generated from investors.''
We note that the language we are proposing to strike_``items or services furnished''_is superfluous because, if
the revenue is ``generated'' (i.e., induced 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to come to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the joint venture for items or services 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
by an investor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is tainted. Thus, the language we are proposing to delete appears not to have added anything and merely caused
confusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following example demonstrates the confusion and our solution. If a radiologist holds an investment interest
in an imaging center and reads all the films at the center, his or her reading of the film does not taint all the revenues
from the referrals by non-investors. However, we have received a few questions from people who read the 60&hyph;40
revenue rule as making such referrals tainted because the investor furnished services at the joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We emphasize that if a radiologist-investor is reading the film 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
making referrals or otherwise generating business, then the revenues the joint venture derives from that activity
would become tainted. For example, revenues would be tainted when a radiologist-investor takes part in a consultation
with a non-investor internist, and during that consultation the radiologist recommends a procedure which is performed
at the joint venture.

C. Clarifications to Space and Equipment Rental and Personal Services and Management Contracts Safe Harbors (&sect;&sect;1001.952
(b), (c) and (d))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;In the preamble discussing the safe harbor provisions for space and equipment rental and personal services
and management contracts (56 FR 35971&hyph;74), we made clear that one of our concerns was that health care providers
in a position to make referrals to each other who engaged in these business arrangements could renegotiate their contracts
on a regular basis depending on the volume of business generated. It is for this reason that we require the leases or
contracts be for a term of not less than one year. (See &sect;&sect;1001.952(b)(4), 1001.952(c)(4), and 1001.952(d)(4).)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has come to our attention that a small number of health care providers believe they are complying with the literal
terms of these safe harbor provisions, but are circumventing our intent not to protect agreements that are renegotiated
based on the volume of business generated between the parties. They believe that they are protected if they enter into
multiple agreements, each of which is for a period of one year, but when all the agreements are viewed together renegotiations
are taking place more frequently (e.g., every month), with the terms of the additional agreements based in part on
the volume of business being generated between the parties under existing agreements. For example, a one year personal
services contract between a hospital and a high-volume referring physician is created for the physician to perform
certain services. The next month a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
new
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 one year contract is created for a slightly different service, with the amount of payment influenced by the previous
months referrals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This scenario does not comply with the requirement in each of these safe harbor provisions that the compensation not
take ``into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.''
(&sect;&sect;1001.952(b)(5), 1001.952(c)(5), and 1001.952(d)(5)). However, because the principal problem
in this situation is that the parties are creating multiple overlapping agreements, we are proposing to revise these
three safe harbor provisions to expressly preclude such schemes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it appears that some health care providers are attempting to pay for referrals by renting more space than
they actually need from referral sources. Although such an arrangement would not fit within a safe harbor because
the aggregate rental charge would be determined in a manner that would account for the volume or value of referrals
or business otherwise generated between the parties, we are proposing to revise the safe harbor provisions in &sect;&sect;1001.952
(b)(5), (c)(5) and (d)(5) to expressly preclude this practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Clarifications to Referral Services Safe-Harbor (&sect;1001.952(f))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One of the standards in the referral services safe harbor provision requires that any fee the referral service
charges the participant be ``based on the cost of operating the referral service, and not on the volume or value of any
referrals to or business otherwise generated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
by the participants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the referral service *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.'' (Emphasis added) (&sect;1001.952(f)(2)). This language
precludes protection where a referral service, such as one operated by a hospital, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
lowers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its referral service fee to one of its staff physicians who participates in the service because that physician is a
high-volume referrer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This language creates an ambiguity where the referral service tries to adjust its fee based on the volume of referrals

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
it makes to the participant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, we propose clarifying the second prong to preclude safe harbor protection for payments that are based on the
volume or value of referrals to or business otherwise generated by either party for the other party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Clarifications To Discount Safe Harbor (&sect;1001.952(h))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Many people requested clarification of the safe harbor for discounts. Because there has been some uncertainty
over what obligations individuals or entities have to meet in order to receive protection under this safe harbor,
we propose dividing the parties into three groups: buyers, sellers, and offerors of discounts. In describing each
party's obligations, we would revise paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2), and add a new paragraph (h)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, through a proposed new paragraph (h)(4), we would clarify that, for purposes of this regulation, a ``rebate''
is any discount which is not given at the time of sale. Consequently, a rebate transaction may be covered within the
safe harbor if it involves a buyer under &sect;1001.952 (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii), but it is not covered if it involves
a buyer under &sect;1001.952(h)(1)(iii) because, under that provision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all discounts must be given at the time of sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also wish to clarify what has to happen for sellers to receive safe harbor protection. In the safe harbor regulation
itself, we state that discounts will be safe harbored if both the seller ``and'' the buyer comply with the applicable
standards as described in the rule. Yet in the preamble we state that sellers should not be held liable for the omissions
of buyers. If a seller has done everything that it reasonably could under the circumstances to ensure that the buyer
understands its obligations to accurately report the discount, the seller is safe harbored irrespective of the omissions
of the buyer. To receive such protection, however, the seller must report the discount to the buyer and inform the buyer
of its obligation to report the discount. To emphasize that the seller's obligations require more than superficial
compliance with the safe harbor, we propose to add to that the seller must inform the buyer ``in an effective manner''
of its obligations to report the discount. We also propose adding a requirement that the seller ``refrain from doing
anything that would impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this paragraph.'' Thus, if the seller, in
good faith, meets its obligations under the safe harbor and the buyer does not meet its obligations due to no fault of
the seller, the seller would receive safe harbor protection. However, when the seller submits a claim or request for
payment on behalf of the buyer, the seller must fully and accurately report the discount to Medicare or the State health
care program. Likewise, when an offeror of a discount meets its obligations under &sect;1001.952(h)(3), and the
buyer or seller does not meet its obligations due to no fault of the offeror, the offeror would receive safe harbor protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we are proposing to clarify whether any reduction in price offered to a beneficiary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 could be safe harbored under this regulation. Congress protected ``a discount or other reduction in price 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
obtained by a provider of services or other entity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis added) and made no provision for such discounts obtained by a beneficiary. In &sect;1001.952(h)(3)(iv)
of the regulation, we removed from safe harbor protection a ``reduction in price offered to a beneficiary *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.''
In that section, all we intended to remove from this safe harbor was ``routine reduction or waiver of any coinsurance
or deductible amount owed by a program beneficiary.'' Thus, to the extent that a discount is offered to a beneficiary
and all other applicable standards in the safe harbor are met, such a discount would receive safe harbor protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many people have expressed confusion regarding the relationship between the safe harbor for discounts and the statutory
exception for discounts. (See section 1128B(b)(3)(A) of the Act.) Specifically, we are asked if there are any practices
involving discounts which were protected by Congress under the statutory exception which do not fit within the safe
harbor for discounts. Our intention is that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the discounts or reductions in price that Congress intended to protect under the statutory exception for discounts
are protected under the safe harbor for discounts. Moreover, as is illustrated by the discussion above regarding
discounts to beneficiaries, we are proposing to expand the safe harbor for discounts to include additional practices
that we do not consider abusive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the final regulation, we stated that when reporting a discount, one only need report the actual purchase
price and note that it is a ``net discount'' (56 FR 35981). However, for purposes of submitting a claim or request for
payment, what is necessary is that the value of the discount is accurately reflected in the actual purchase price.
It is not necessary to distinguish whether this price is the result of a discount, or to state ``net discount.'' Consequently,
buyers who were uncertain about how and where to report on a particular form the fact that the price was due to a discount
need not be concerned with reporting that fact, as long as the actual purchase price accurately reflects the discount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we are proposing some minor editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the provision, but hopefully
make it easier to understand.

F. Technical Correction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;A typographical error at 56 FR 35978 gave a citation to a HCFA rule on payment for intraocular lenses as ``55 FR
436.'' We would correct this citation to the HCFA rule to read as ``55 FR 4536.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are proposing the deletion of &sect;1001.953 which calls for the completion of an OIG report on compliance
with the investment interest safe harbor at &sect;1001.952(a)(2)(i) and 1001.952(a)(2)(vi) within a specified
period of time after publication of the original safe harbor provisions. While the OIG is continuing its work on evaluating
this safe harbor provision, we believe completion of this report to be an internal administrative process that need
not be set forth in the regulations.

III. Regulatory Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we indicated in the original safe harbor final rule published on July 29, 1991, consistent with the intent of the
statute, the original safe harbor rulemaking and these proposed clarifications are designed to permit individuals
and entities to freely engage in business practices and arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and
economy. In doing so, the regulations impose no requirements on any party. Health care providers and others may voluntarily
seek to comply with these provisions so that they have the assurance that their business practices are not subject
to any enforcement action under the anti-kickback statute. We believe that the economic impact of these provisions
would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, and we have, therefore,
not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes two sets of amendments to the Department of Transportation's rules implementing the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). The first group of proposals is based on petitions for rulemaking from members of the
public. While the Department is publishing proposed amendments based on these petitions, in order to seek public
comment on them, the Department is not now taking a position on whether these amendments should be adopted. The petitions
would create an exception to the provision requiring transit providers to allow persons with disabilities to use
every stop in the system, change the requirements affecting certain private schools that provide fixed route transportation,
change the provision of the Department's technical standards concerning gaps for higher-speed people mover vehicles
and eliminate the provision that requires paratransit systems to allow reservations to be made 14 days in advance.
Second, the Department is proposing a number of minor or technical adjustments to clarify or improve administration
of certain portions of the rule.

Petitions for Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has received four petitions for rulemaking, each of which requests an amendment to the Department's
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rules. The Department is acting on the petitions by issuing this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM). If, based on the comments and the Department's further consideration of the issues involved,
the Department believes the proposed changes have merit, it can issue final rules based on this NPRM. At this time,
however, the Department is not taking a position on whether the proposed changes should be adopted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seattle Metro seeks a change in 49 CFR 37.167(g), which provides as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The entity shall not refuse to permit a passenger who uses a lift to disembark from a vehicle at any designated stop,
unless the lift cannot be deployed, the lift will be damaged if it is deployed, or temporary conditions at the stop,
not under the control of the entity, preclude the safe use of the stop by all passengers.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is inconsistent with this section for a transit provider to refuse to let a passenger use a lift at any designated
stop, unless the lift is physically unable to deploy or the lift would be damaged if it did.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
In addition, if a temporary situation at the stop (construction, an accident, a landslide) made the stop unsafe for
anyone to use, the provider could decline to use the lift there (just as it refused to open the door for other passengers
at the same point). The provider could not, however, declare a stop ``off limits'' to persons with disabilities that
is used for other persons. If the transit authority has concerns about barriers or safety hazards, that particularly
affect individuals with disabilities that would use the stop, it should consider making efforts to move the stop.

Seattle Metro urges the Department to change this policy. Metro's petition says that its bus lifts need 4&hyph;5 feet
to deploy and that persons using mobility aids need another 4 feet in order to maneuver off the lift. The petition asserts
that it has 6220 fully accessible bus stops, 1571 that do not meet present ADA standards (i.e., a lift cannot deploy
at these stops), and 702 that could be used by standees but do not provide adequate space for wheelchair users. The inaccessibility
of stops is due, Metro says, to factors such as topography and terrain, line of sight, traffic speed, and access to shoulder
pullout areas, all of which are more or less permanent matters beyond its control. Often, local jurisdictions, rather
than Metro, control these factors as well as the locations of the bus stops themselves. This, in Metro's view, often
makes it impractical to relocate stops to more accessible locations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allowing passengers to choose to disembark at ``inaccessible'' locations may create safety hazards, Metro asserts.
Passengers with disabilities should not be allowed to decide it is safe to use a particular stop, in Metro's view, particularly
since the visual or cognitive disabilities of some passengers could impair their ability to make an adequate assessment
of the situation and since a visual inspection might not, in any event, reveal the problems of a site. Metro is concerned
about tort liability in such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With its petition, Metro provided a brief videotape, which we have made part of the docket. It shows wheelchair users
leaving or entering buses in locations where narrowness of the sidewalk (i.e., next to a retaining wall, adjacent
to a grassy knoll) or other conditions (e.g., an eroded, broken sidewalk) make it difficult (but not necessarily impossible)
to get on or off the bus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Metro has petitioned the Department to amend &sect;37.167(g) in two ways. First, Metro would permit transit providers
to refuse to allow persons with disabilities to use stops available to other passengers if ``the lift, when fully deployed,
would leave inadequate space at the stop for the passenger to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground.''
Second, Metro would add a sentence saying that ``A stop which does not meet the specifications set forth in &sect;10.2.1(1)
of appendix A to 49 CFR part 37 shall be deemed to provide inadequate space for passengers using common wheelchairs
to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground.'' For information of potential commenters, the bus stop
standards in Appendix A that Metro references are the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Where new bus stop pads are constructed at bus stops, bays, or other areas where a lift or ramp is to be deployed, they
shall have a firm, stable surface; minimum clear length of 96 inches (measured from the curb or roadway vehicle edge)
and a minimum clear width of 60 inches (measured parallel to the vehicle roadway) to the maximum extent allowed by legal
or site constraints; and shall be connected to streets, sidewalks, or pedestrian paths by an accessible route complying
with 4.3 and 4.4. The slope of the pad parallel to the roadway shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as the roadway.
For water drainage, a maximum slope of 1:50 (2%) perpendicular to the roadway is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed.

It should be noted that Metro's proposal would apply this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
existing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 bus stops. Also, the standard refers to ``bus stop pads,'' not to bus stops in general. In addition, the standard's
minimum clear width and length requirements are required ``to the extent allowed by legal or site constraints.''
Site constraints would appear to include the kinds of conditions of which Metro's petition speaks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effect of its proposed amendment, Metro says, would be to allow transit providers to refuse to serve wheelchair
passengers at stops that did not meet Access Board standards. According to Metro, this would place an additional 702
stops (8 percent of the total number of stops in the system) off limits to wheelchair users. However, other passengers
with disabilities (e.g., standees) and passengers without disabilities would be served at these stops. While Metro's
petition does not specify how service to origins and destinations served by these stops (or the other 19 percent of
stops at which lifts will not deploy at all) would be made available to wheelchair users, the Department assumes individuals
who need accessible service to those destinations would be eligible for paratransit.

2. Requirements for Private School Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress exempted ``public school transportation'' from the transportation requirements of the ADA, by defining
such transportation not to be ``designated public transportation.'' The House Public Works Committee Report on
the legislation says that it is the intent of Congress that the same exemption should apply to private elementary and
secondary school transportation if the school receives Federal financial assistance, is covered by section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and provides equivalent transportation service to students with disabilities
(see H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, Pt. 1, at 36). In addition, religiously-affiliated schools are exempt from the ADA altogether,
based on the ADA's exemption for religious organizations. Section 37.27 of the Department's ADA regulation implements
these exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As pointed out in the petition of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), schools that are private,
not religiously affiliated, and not recipients of Federal funds do not benefit from any of these exemptions. As private
entities not primarily in the business of transporting people providing (usually) fixed route transportation with
vehicles with a passenger capacity exceeding 16 persons, they are subject to a requirement to purchase all new accessible
school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAIS says ``[t]he cost of this requirement is enormous, and in relation to the cost the benefit to disabled students
is minimal, because there is no need that every vehicle purchased be accessible; all disabled students may be served
as long as a sufficient number of the vehicles are accessible.'' The NAIS petition seeks a modification of the current
regulation to place its members on the same footing as other schools, saying that ``independent schools which do not
receive federal financial assistance are the only schools who are required to purchase accessible vehicles even
when the school already has sufficient such vehicles to provide adequate services to students with disabilities.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested modification would amend &sect;37.27 to apply the same requirement to private schools that do not receive
Federal assistance as to other private schools, i.e. a requirement to provide equivalent transportation services
to students with disabilities.

3. People Mover Gap Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Special Standards Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has petitioned the Department to
modify its technical standards concerning horizontal and vertical gaps for automated guideway transit (AGT) vehicles
and systems, better known as ``people movers.'' 49 CFR &sect;38.173 requires that the horizontal gap between a stopped
AGT vehicle's door and the platform be no greater than one inch, with a vertical gap of plus or minus one half inch. The
regulation allows other rail systems (e.g., rapid and light rail) to have horizontal and vertical gaps of 3 inches
and plus or minus 5/8 inch, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE suggests that the regulation should recognize a distinction between AGT systems based on vehicle speed. AGT
systems vary in speed from 5 to 80 miles per hour, ASCE says, and it is, in the organization's view, more appropriate
for higher-speed AGTs to meet the more flexible standards applicable to rapid and light rail systems than the narrower
AGT standard. ASCE cites the Access Board's preamble discussion concerning AGT systems, which refers to ``AGT vehicles
that travel at slow speed,'' and subsequent Access Board manuals suggesting that the rapid/light rail gap should
apply to faster AGT vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE surveyed existing AGT systems, determining that most do not comply with the current AGT gap standards. The petition
cites engineering reasons (e.g., the need in higher-speed vehicles for larger and more complex suspension systems,
which in turn make it more difficult to meet existing gap standards) for this phenomenon. Based on its data and engineering
analysis, ASCE recommends that 20 miles per hour be the dividing line: systems that operate below that speed can reasonably
meet the current AGT standard, while faster systems should be allowed to meet the rapid/light rail standard. (The
Access Board has interpreted its guidelines, as presently worded, to permit the construction urged by ASCE. The Department
does not object to this interpretation; nevertheless, for the sake of clarity in the rule text, we are proposing to
amend the language. The Department will also work with the Access Board to incorporate changes in the guidelines that
may be made with respect to vehicle/platform gaps in AGT systems.)

4. 14-day Advance Reservations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 CFR &sect;37.131(b)(4) provides, with respect to complementary paratransit services, that ``the entity shall
permit advance reservations to be made up to 14 days in advance of an ADA paratransit eligible individual's desired
trip.'' This provision, not a part of the NPRM that led to the Department's final ADA rule, was added in response to comments
to the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two separate petitions urge the Department to eliminate this provision. One is from Doug Douglas, Assistant Vice-President,
Paratransit Services, of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). Mr. Douglas draws a distinction between advance reservations
in a context like the airline industry, where the customer goes to the point of service, and paratransit. In the former,
he says, if a passenger cancels a reservation or does not show up for the plane, the airline can simply fill in the reserved
spot with a standby passenger. Paratransit does not have this flexibility, since the vehicle must be rerouted in the
case of a cancellation or makes a futile trip in case of a no-show. Cancellations and no-shows are a major problem for
his system, Mr. Douglas asserts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are a number of arguments to support the repeal of the 14 days advanced reservation requirements as prescribed
by &sect;7.131. The most obvious reason is the waste of precious resources on clients who reserve trips well in advance,
forget the trip has been scheduled, and do not call the provider to cancel the trip. Even when the client does remember
to cancel the trip, they are only required to do so within an hour prior to the scheduled pick-up time, which does not
allow us to effectively utilize the time slot for another client. We are averaging 16,183 canceled trips and 2,936
no-shows per month. Fourteen days advance reservation does not appear to be operationally feasible in a paratransit
environment, and should be repealed or revised to make it more palatable for providers of specialized transportation
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Patrisha Piras, a California transportation consultant and Board member of AC Transit, also petitioned the Department
to eliminate this provision. She views this provision as an impediment to the effective implementation of ``real-time''
scheduling for paratransit services. Her rationale is the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Real-time scheduling provides a dynamic ability for the service provider to respond to the current level of demand
from service users. Adjustments in wait time and vehicle trip patterns are based on the current situation ``on the
street.'' This is a significant contrast to traditional ``advance reservation'' systems, where trips are booked
several days in advance, creating an artificial picture of actual service, since often users would subsequently
cancel or rearrange trips, and the provider would then have to rearrange planned vehicle deployment and assignments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[In my experience] *&blank;*&blank;*, often up to one third of trips booked on an advance reservation system are ultimately
cancels or no-shows. This further creates a ``blocking'' mechanism, so that potential users would call farther and
farther in advance to ensure a better chance of getting a ride *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
What the 14-day advance provision does is to institutionalize capacity constraints, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
with a preference for people who have decided on their trip long in advance. This is counter to other philosophical
bases of the regulation, which call for paratransit service to be relatively comparable to fixed-route, including
the sense of ``spontaneity'' without having to pre-plan a trip. The 14-day advance provision also imposes or allows
an implicit priority to certain kinds of trips, such as medical or other appointments, where the rider (and often the
provider as well!) wants to have the certainty in advance that the trip is available. This, too, is counter to the basic
service criteria of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 14-day advance reservation provision should be eliminated (or, at a minimum, be made permissive and subservient
to the other criteria) *&blank;*&blank;* (emphasis in original).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By eliminating the 14-day provision, or making it permissive, the NPRM would permit transit providers to decline
to accept reservations farther from the date of travel than the day before. The minimum reservation time requirement_that
providers must provide next-day service_would, of course, remain in place.

DOT-Proposed Adjustments to the Rule

1. Reduction of Paperwork for Paratransit Plan Updates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Department's ADA regulation, each fixed route public transit operator was required to submit a paratransit
plan to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) by January 26, 1992. Section 37.135(c) of the rule requires that
``each entity shall submit an update to the plan on January 26 of each succeeding year.'' Section 37.139(j) requires
these updates to include information needed to update the information requirements applying to the original plan,
significant changes or revisions to the timetable, whether milestones for progress toward full compliance have
been met, explanations of any slippage that has occurred in meeting the timetable for full compliance, and corrective
action for any slippage. The same public participation requirements that applied to the original plan (including
notice, a public hearing, and consultation with the disability community) apply to updates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FTA data indicate that about 117 of the 540 fixed route operators required to submit paratransit plans have indicated
that they expected to be fully in compliance by the end of 1993. Another 70 providers expected to be fully in compliance
by the end of 1994. By full compliance, we mean that the transit property meets all six service criteria spelled out
for paratransit systems in the regulation (concerning service area, response time, trip purpose, hours and days
of service, fares, and capacity constraints). It appears unnecessary to require transit properties which in fact
meet all criteria to do the paperwork for an update every year. If a system is fully in compliance, and no significant
changes have occurred, going through this process has no benefit for passengers with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Department is proposing to modify &sect;&sect;37.135(c) and 37.139(j) to allow transit properties
who fully comply with all service criteria for paratransit service to rely on the assurance of ADA compliance required
by &sect;27.4, rather than submitting an update report. If significant changes occurred that could affect compliance,
or if the system fell out of compliance with respect to one or more of the service criteria, it would have to notify FTA
of the problem and submit annual updates until it had returned to compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has some concern that, if it adopts this proposal, it may not have an adequate source of data about the
compliance status of transit authorities, ridership, or costs. Such data may be useful for program evaluation as
well as forming a basis for reports to Congress or the public. The Department seeks comment on whether, if this proposal
is adopted, there should be any additional data reporting requirements concerning paratransit compliance, ridership,
and costs.

Section 37.127, concerning complimentary paratransit service for visitors, provides that a public entity is not
required to provide service to a visitor for more than 21 days from the date of the first paratransit trip used by the
visitor. We have been asked whether this means 21 consecutive days or a collection of days over a given period of time
adding up to 21. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we propose to add the words ``per year.'' This means that a visitor
could have any 21 days of eligibility in any calendar year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 37.101 contains the vehicle acquisition requirements for private entities not primarily engaged in the
business of transporting people. Because of the way that section 302 of the ADA itself it drafted, there is no specific
vehicle acquisition requirement for ``private not primarily engaged'' entities providing demand responsive service
with vehicles having a capacity of 16 or fewer passengers. Rather, entities in this situation must provide equivalent
service to passengers with disabilities. This requirement is set forth in &sect;37.171. To avoid confusion, we propose
to add to &sect;37.101 a new paragraph containing a cross-reference to &sect;37.171.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 37.123(f)(1)(i) permits an eligible individual traveling on ADA paratransit to be accompanied by a ``personal
care attendant'' (PCA) as well as by any other person of the individual's choice. Section 37.131(c)(3) says that the
PCA rides without charge, while the other companion must pay the paratransit fare. These provisions have led to questions
about who should be regarded as a PCA. Section 37.123(f)(1)(ii) attempted to provide guidance on this issue by saying
that a family member or friend traveling with an eligible individual is not regarded as a PCA unless that person is acting
in the capacity of a PCA. The Appendix discussion of this section notes that a PCA is someone ``designated or employed
specifically to help the individual meet his or her personal needs,'' such as eating, drinking, using the bathroom,
communicating etc. The Appendix also notes that the paratransit provider may, as part of the eligibility certification
process, require that eligible individuals register as users of PCAs. The companion of someone not so registering
could be charged the paratransit fare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is aware that there may be definitions of PCA used in other contexts (e.g., human services programs).
We seek comment on whether one of these definitions would be appropriate for use in the context of paratransit.

5. Equivalent Facilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current provisions concerning ``equivalent facilitation'' (&sect;&sect;37.7 and 37.9) require, as one condition
for obtaining a determination of equivalent facilitation, that an entity demonstrate its ``reasons for inability
to comply'' with the existing regulatory standards. In other words, before the Department can determine that something
is an equivalent facilitation, the applicant must show not only that it is proposing a solution providing equal or
greater accessibility, but also that it is precluded from using the solution provided for in the Department's standards.
The purpose of this provision was to limit departures from established regulatory standards to those situations
where they could not be applied and, therefore, to discourage a proliferation of solutions that might undermine the
goal of having uniform, predictable standards. This approach has the disadvantage, however, of also discouraging
newer technologies or more innovative solutions that might actually provide accessibility gains in some situations.
For this reason, the Department is proposing to delete the ``inability to comply'' language from the equivalent facilitation
sections of the rule. We seek comment on whether this is a good idea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would point out that the proposed change is not intended to diminish the requirement that any equivalent facilitation
provide equal or greater accessibility. For example, it would not permit a rail system to avoid installing detectable
warnings meeting the regulatory standards without that system having demonstrated that a substitute design was
as detectable or more detectable by persons with impaired vision.

6. Clarification of Appendix Statement on Vehicle Lift 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dimensions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 38, the Department
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s standards for accessible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles, contains dimensions for wheelchair lifts on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. The reference to these dimensions in the Part 37, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, discussion of &sect;37.13 speaks of the ``new 30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; x 48
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; lift platform specifications.'' While the dimensions are 30 x 48 inches at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a distance of two inches above the platform, the width of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the platform need only be 28.5 inches at the platform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself. This seeming discrepancy has confused some readers. To resolve it, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose to remove the words ``30'' by ``48'' from the Appendix, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so that the reference is simply to the lift standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 38.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;37.3, in the definition of ``designated public transportation,'' the word ``containing'' in the final
line should be ``continuing.'' In &sect;37.11(a), the reference in the last line to ``Subpart F'' of 49 CFR Part 27
should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Subpart C'' (Part 27 no longer contains any Subpart F). Commenters are encouraged to note other such errors, so that
they can also be corrected.

This NPRM does not propose a significant rule under

Executive Order 12866. It is a significant NPRM under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, since it would amend the Department's Americans with Disabilities
Act rule, which is a significant rule. We expect economic impacts to be minimal, so we have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared a regulatory evaluation. There are no Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts sufficient to warrant the preparation of a Federalism assessment. The Department certifies that the proposals,
if adopted, will not have a

(b) The requirements of this part do not apply to the transportation of school children to and from a private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elementary or secondary school, and its school-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, if the school is providing transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service to students with disabilities equivalent to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to students without disabilities. The test of equivalence is the same as that provided in &sect;37.105.
If the school does not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of this paragraph for exemption from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of this part, it is subject to the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this part for private entities not primarily engaged in transporting people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in this paragraph, each entity shall submit an annual update to its plan on January 26 of each succeeding
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If an entity has met and is continuing to meet fully all requirements for complementary paratransit in &sect;&sect;37.121
through 37.133 of this part, the entity may submit to FTA on January 26 of each succeeding year a certification of compliance
in lieu of a plan update. Entities that have submitted a joint plan under &sect;37.141 may submit a joint certification
under this paragraph. The requirements of &sect;&sect;37.137 through 37.139 do not apply when a certification is
submitted under this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the event of any change in circumstances that results in an entity which has submitted a certification of compliance
falling short of full compliance with &sect;&sect;37.121 through 37.133 in any respect, the entity shall immediately
notify FTA of the problem. In this case, the entity shall file a plan update meeting the requirements of &sect;&sect;37.137
through 37.139 of this part on the next following January 26 and in each succeeding year until the entity returns to
full compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An entity which has been granted a waiver from any provision of this part on the basis of undue financial burden shall
file a plan update meeting the requirements of &sect;&sect;37.137 through 37.139 of this part on each January 26 during
which the waiver is in effect.

(i) The lift cannot be deployed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The lift will be damaged if it is deployed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The lift, when fully deployed, would leave an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate space at the stop for the passenger to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Temporary conditions at the stop, not under the control of the entity, preclude the safe use of the stop by all passengers.

of threatened species of sea turtles consistent with section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Existing
regulations provide for the issuance of an incidental take permit for endangered sea turtles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eretmochelys imbricata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepidochelys olivacea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific
coast of Mexico, and the breeding population of olive ridley turtles on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed
as endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a review of the biology of sea turtles and the causes and extent
of their decline. The NAS concluded that incidental capture in shrimp trawls without turtle excluder devices (TEDs)
is by far the leading cause of human-induced mortality to sea turtles at sea, but that collectively, activities in
the non-shrimp fisheries constitute the second largest source of mortality. The study identified finfish trawls,
seine nets, pompano gillnets, and various passive fishing gear, such as sink gillnets, weirs, traps and longlines,
as potential sources of mortality to sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because threatened sea turtles are often incidentally taken in state coastal fisheries, NMFS established a regulatory
framework that requires the use of TEDs on most shrimp trawls and allows NMFS to impose measures with respect to shrimp
trawl and other fisheries to protect sea turtles, such as the use of limited tow times, the requirement to carry observers,
and the closure of certain areas (57 FR 57348, December 4, 1992). Under this framework, measures are implemented as
temporary restrictions, which is a time-consuming, repetitious, and short-term means to accomplish conservation
measures for sea turtles. For example, NMFS has implemented many temporary restrictions allowing the North Carolina
shrimp fishery to comply with tow-time limits as an alternative to using TEDs in areas of high algae concentrations
(see 58 FR 48975, September 21, 1993).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an addition to the regulatory framework governing state fisheries in which listed species of sea turtles are incidentally
taken, NMFS is proposing a rule that would extend section 10 permit regulations to all threatened species of sea turtles.
Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to permit under such terms and conditions
as he or she may prescribe, any taking otherwise prohibited by section 9(a)(1)(B) of the ESA, if the taking is incidental
to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. NMFS implemented regulations for the application
and issuance of incidental take permits, under section 10(a) of the ESA, which appear at 50 CFR parts 220 and 222, and
allow the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) to issue permits to incidentally take endangered marine
species during otherwise lawful activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While sections 9 and 10 and corresponding regulations apply to species listed as endangered, they may be applied to
threatened species as well, pursuant to section 4(d) of the ESA. Section 4(d) provides that the Secretary issue such
regulations as deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such species. For example, for those
threatened species whose taking is prohibited by NMFS (such as salmon (50 CFR 227.21) and Guadalupe fur seal (50 CFR
227.11)), NMFS has promulgated special regulations that allow incidental takings of such species in compliance
with a section 10 incidental take permit. Although NMFS has extended the section 9 takings prohibitions to threatened
sea turtles (50 CFR 227.71(a)), the exceptions to the prohibitions contained in 50 CFR 227.72 do not provide for the
issuance of an incidental take permit. This rule, as proposed, would make it possible to issue such permits for the
taking of threatened sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extension of the section 10 incidental take permit exception to threatened sea turtles would allow the same substantive
protective measures that can be implemented, and the same fishing activities that can be carried out, as under the
current regulatory framework, while eliminating the procedural shortcomings of the regulatory framework, such
as the short duration of the rules and the length of time required to issue rules. Incidental take permits are not intended
to undermine the TED-use requirement or the taking prohibition in general. Furthermore, the regulatory framework
would remain in effect for any entity that has not been issued an incidental take permit. This proposed rule would provide
an additional means whereby non-Federal entities can engage in commercial fishing practices while affording adequate
protection to both endangered and threatened sea turtles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through the implementation of this proposed rule, NMFS would accept and consider incidental take permit applications
from non-Federal entities, such as individuals, businesses, municipalities, fishery organizations and state
agencies. NMFS anticipates that it would invite state agencies, which are responsible for regulating state fisheries,
to apply for general permits that would cover specific fisheries known or believed to incidentally take threatened
or endangered sea turtles. This would be more efficient than requiring permits for individual vessels. It would also
allow the states to assume management of fisheries through the permits, which are limited to activities within the
territorial sea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general permit procedures in 50 CFR part 220, as well as the endangered species permit requirements in 50 CFR part
222, would apply to the application, issuance, modification, revocation, suspension and amendment of an incidental
take permit for threatened, as well as for endangered sea turtles.

This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This
requirement has been approved previously by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Control Number 0648&hyph;0230).
The reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average approximately 80 hours for permit applications,
0.5 hours for certificate of inclusion applications and 0.5 hours for reports. These estimates include the time for
reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the National Marine Fisheries Service (F/PR), 1335 East-West
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and
Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503 (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Act Project 0648&hyph;0230). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because the proposed rule establishes a discretionary permitting procedure that will,
by itself, have no economic impact on fisherman. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA prepared an EA for this proposed rule that concludes that the rule would have no significant impact on the human
environment. A copy of the EA is available (see

 The Department of Housing and Urban Development is proposing to revise Regulation X, the regulation implementing
the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), as amended to extend its coverage to subordinate liens and for
other purposes and to make technical corrections. This proposed rule addresses referral payments, computer loan
origination services, and controlled business disclosure requirements, and is intended to protect consumer interests
while recognizing the potential benefits of technological and business arrangement innovations relating to these
areas.

, above) is to provide owners and operators of computer loan origination systems (CLOs) with an opportunity to demonstrate
or discuss the operation and benefits of their systems and the impact of the proposed rule on their systems, and to provide
consumer groups, industry organizations, and members of the public with an opportunity to witness such presentations
or demonstrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed more fully below, this rule proposes to modify the application of the current Regulation X to CLOs. Information
gained by the Department from the Technology Demonstration may be used in developing a final rule. Owners and operators
are invited to notify the Department of their interest in participating in this Technology Demonstration. Participants
will be free to make visual or conceptual presentations without including actual use of computer loan origination
systems. Based upon the number of interested parties and other practical considerations, the Department will determine
the format, timing, and logistical arrangements for the Technology Demonstration. To the extent feasible, the Department
will provide electrical and telephonic hook-ups for participants. The Department reserves the option of limiting
the length of presentations, or setting any other guidelines for participation, in accordance with the number of
participants.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 2, 1992, HUD published a revised Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.)
(RESPA) rule (hereinafter ``final rule'' or ``1992 final rule''), which became effective on December 2, 1992, and
was amended on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505). Technical corrections were published on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14748).
The final rule contained long-awaited provisions implementing amendments to RESPA regarding controlled businesses.
These amendments were originally enacted in 1983 as section 461 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act (HURRA),
Pub. L. 98&hyph;181. The final rule also updated the original RESPA rule, which had not been amended since 1976. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 28, 1992, a few days before publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, then-President Bush signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 202&hyph;550) (1992 Act),
which amended RESPA to state specifically that the making of a mortgage loan was a covered transaction (a Federal court
case had created uncertainty) and that refinancing transactions were transactions covered by RESPA. The 1992 Act
also extended RESPA's coverage to all subordinate liens involving 1- to 4-family residential property. Implementing
provisions, along with revisions of the final rule, are set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 10, 1994, and are effective on August 9, 1994. The effect of the statutory and regulatory changes was to
expand substantially the coverage of this criminal and civil statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following issuance of the final rule, two lawsuits were filed: one by the Mortgage Bankers Association and one by a
group of independent service providers, called CRISIS. Both suits objected to provisions of the final rule and alleged
that HUD had not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) in promulgating the November
2, 1992, rule. The cases have been dismissed, but are subject to being reinstituted at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon assuming office, HUD officials in the new Administration were inundated with comments_mostly complaints_about
the final rule issued in the last days of the previous Administration. Notably absent from the interests contacting
HUD about the final rule were any representatives of consumer interests. Instead, comments came almost entirely
from the affected industries. Some industry representatives argued that the provisions of the final rule benefited
consumers, while others argued that the provisions, sometimes the same provisions, were harmful to consumers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also received allegations that the final rule created uncertainty about whether referral fees were
in fact prohibited by RESPA. Specifically, some commenters claimed that the introduction in the final rule of an employer-employee
exemption from the prohibition on referral fees prompted some persons to set up sham employer-employee relationships
to shield prohibited referral fees, and prompted others to ``extort'' referral fees from other settlement service
providers on the premise that HUD now allowed such compensation. The final rule did not authorize such practices;
however, some commenters argued that the existence of confusion about whether it did suggested that the final rule
failed to establish a bright line, comprehensible to industry participants, between permissible and impermissible
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the controversy over the final rule, the Secretary determined that a review of the previous policies was needed,
particularly focusing on the final rule's impact on consumers. The Secretary also articulated three principles
to guide that review: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) HUD's responsibility is to protect the consumer_not to mediate among industry interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HUD should regulate multibillion dollar industries responsibly_principally by acting quickly to end uncertainty.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Technological and business arrangement innovations have the potential to provide significant consumer benefits,
and HUD does not serve consumers well if its regulations unduly stifle such advancements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 6, 1993, in an effort to ensure that the new Administration heard the views of all interested parties, the Department
published a ``notice of written comment period and informal public hearing'' (58 FR 38176), inviting testimony and
written comments on the impact on consumers of the following four provisions of the final rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 3500.14(g)(2)(ii), which provides that RESPA Section 8 does not prohibit ``an employer's payment to its
own employees for any referral activities *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as the ``employer-employee
exemption'' or ``Issue 1''.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3500.14(g)(2)(iii), which provides that Section 8 of RESPA does not prohibit ``any payment by a borrower
for computer loan origination services, as long as the disclosure set forth in Appendix E of [the final rule] is provided
the borrower.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as the ``computer loan origination (CLO) exemption'' or ``Issue

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3500.13(b)(2), which provides that ``in determining whether provisions of State law or regulations concerning
controlled business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Secretary may not construe those
provisions that impose more stringent limitations on controlled business arrangements as inconsistent with RESPA,
as long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as ``preemption

of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part'' of certain information
regarding the ownership and financial relationships between referring and referred-to parties, and for certain
timing and other methods for disclosure. (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as ``controlled business disclosure
policy'' or ``Issue 4''.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a public hearing held on August 6, 1993, at the General Services Administration (GSA) Auditorium in Washington,
DC, all 36 parties who had requested to testify did so. Twenty-two witnesses opposed provisions of the rule and 14 witnesses
supported provisions of the rule. The Department also received 1,553 written comments.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Of the 1,526 comments reviewed, 1,148 comments opposing provisions of the final rule were received from mortgage
lenders, or State or regional organizations representing mortgage lending professionals; consumer organizations;
3 Federal agencies; and, in both combined comments and separately, several State Attorneys General. An additional
325 critical comments were received from law firms and title insurance companies. Twenty-four comments were wholly
or generally supportive of the final rule, including comments from individuals and organizations in real estate-related
industries, lenders or title insurance providers, real estate brokers, a builder, and the Federal Reserve Board.
The remainder of the comments were not characterized.

III. The Secretary's Position: A Brief Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a complete review of the substantive arguments in support of and in opposition to the final rule provided in
the testimony at the August 6, 1993, hearing; the written comments received; and a review of the RESPA statute, its
purpose, and its history, the Department reached certain conclusions about its policy objectives on Issues 1&hyph;4,
set forth above. The Department therefore proposes to amend the final rule as described below. Recognizing the rapid
evolution of technology and business practices, the Department believes that development of the final rule will
require additional collateral information about how certain details of this proposal will work in practice and whether
these details will further the Department's policy objectives. Therefore, the Department has developed a series
of questions about specific aspects of the proposal and asks commenters to offer any information they may have about
how the rules would work. These questions are detailed throughout this preamble.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are the Department's policy objectives in addressing each issue and the Department's conclusions
as set forth in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Issue 1: The Employer-Employee Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's objective. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Controlled business arrangements and so-called ``one-stop shopping'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
offer consumers significant benefits including reducing time, complexity, and costs associated with settlements.
If they do, the market should produce incentives for the creation of controlled business arrangements without HUD
authorizing incentive payments (otherwise impermissible under RESPA) to encourage these arrangements. However,
HUD cannot scrutinize every aspect of the financial relationship between interrelated companies. Therefore, HUD's
objective is primarily to prohibit compensation for business development for related entities at a point when that
compensation has the greatest potential for overwhelming the other considerations that go into business referrals,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 long-term customer satisfaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD Proposal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The exemption under the final rule permitting employers to pay their own employees referral fees is proposed to
be withdrawn. Under this proposal, no employee of a company may be paid referral fees, even for referrals to an affiliate
company. This proposal is based on the Department's view that the exemption under the final rule was too expansive
and compromised the statute's purpose of protecting the consumer from being referred for settlement services based
on financial gain to the referrer, rather than on the highest quality and best price of the services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the interest of avoiding undue interference with the internal operations of controlled businesses, which
Congress has concluded are permitted business arrangements under RESPA, the proposed rule would allow the payment
of bonuses and compensation to managerial employees in controlled businesses for such purposes as the generation
of business among affiliates; provided, however, that the compensation: (i) Is not tied on a one-to-one basis or calculated
as a multiple of the number or value of any referrals; and (ii) these employees do not routinely deal with the public.

B. Issue 2. Computerized Loan Origination Systems

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's Objective. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments and witnesses at the public hearing demonstrated that there is some confusion concerning the scope of
the Department's authority under RESPA to regulate CLOs. Thus, the Department's first objective in this area is to
clarify what the RESPA rules can and cannot do. (See section below describing the legal framework for analysis of payments
for CLO services.) In addition, the Secretary wishes to encourage the exploration and use of new technology, especially
when the new technology may provide information and services to better inform consumers about one of the largest and
most complex financial transactions in their lives, thus allowing the consumers to be more effective shoppers. However,
the use of that technology does not justify increasing the cost of mortgage loan originations when the technology
does not provide meaningful information otherwise available without charge, or when there is no additional convenience,
clarity, or other benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD Proposal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule would be amended to define a CLO and to provide that payments made by borrowers to CLO operators for use
of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
qualified
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CLO are exempt from RESPA scrutiny. The definition would set forth reasonable requirements for qualified CLO systems
for access, lender-neutrality, and disclosure to consumers. Systems that fall outside the exemption would have
to meet the basic test of Section 8 of RESPA that the borrower's payments be for goods or facilities actually furnished
or for services actually performed.

C. Issue 3: Preemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no proposed changes to the preemption provisions. The Secretary has concluded that change to these provisions
is not warranted at this time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Commenters Opposing the 1992 Revised RESPA Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following summarizes the nature of the commenters and comments opposing and supporting provisions on which HUD
invited comment in its July 6, 1993, notice (58 FR 38176), as well as the positions taken in this proposed rule. In general,
commenters were responsive to the notice's invitation and focused their remarks on the four identified provisions
of the rule. A few comments raised other issues concerning the final rule, but the focus of the hearing and request for
comments was the four specific areas listed. This proposed rule deals only with the four issues on which comment was
invited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven hundred forty-eight commenters opposed provisions of the final rule. Commenters included mortgage lenders,
realtors, and State or regional organizations representing mortgage lending professionals. The Department received
an additional 325 comments critical of the rule from law firms and title insurance providers. Opposition was also
expressed by six national organizations representing elements of the mortgage finance or title insurance industries,
two national consumer organizations, an economist, a legal aid society, a real estate consultant, a law student,
and four commenters whose professional interest could not be ascertained. A few national or regional computer service
providers also commented on the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, 3 Federal agencies_the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the
Office of Thrift Supervision_submitted comments on the final rule, and 4 opposition comments were received from
State Attorneys General, including 1 comment representing the unified position of the Attorneys General of 16 States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Commenters in Support of the Revised RESPA Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments wholly or generally supportive of the final rule were received from 24 individuals and organizations engaged
in real estate-related industries, including 15 lenders or title insurance providers; 6 real estate brokers or agents;
an organization composed of controlled businesses, including realtors, which was formed in part to support the final
rule (RESPRO); a builder; and the Federal Reserve.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Support for portions of the final rule was also expressed in scattered comments received from individuals and businesses
writing to criticize other specific features. The only issue receiving an appreciable amount of positive comment
from critics of the rule's other features was Issue number 4 of the July 6 notice_the controlled business disclosure
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Summary of the Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the ensuing discussion, arguments presented by the commenters related to these four issues will be summarized
under the four issue headings. When commenters have asserted related arguments affecting the disposition of two
or more of these issues, those comments will be mentioned in the course of discussing the issue that HUD perceives to
be the core argument made by the particular commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Issue 1: The Employer-Employee Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer-employee exception provision in &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of the final rule_allowing ``an employer's
payment to its own employees for any referral activities *&blank;*&blank;*''_was the subject of more adverse comment
than any other issue raised by the July 6, 1993, notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hundreds of lenders, attorneys, and settlement agents objected to the rule's provision permitting employer payments
to employees for ``referral activities''. Objections were focused, in large part, on what commenters perceived
as the anticompetitive effect of permitting referral-based payments. Additionally, the Mortgage Bankers Association,
sixteen State attorneys general, and a large number of other institutional and individual commenters saw the referral
payment provision as being directly contrary to the RESPA statute, or, at a minimum, as contravening statutory intent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supporting commenters cited the desirability of vertical integration and the difficulty in enforcing employer-employee
arrangements when the employer controlled all of the relevant documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Anticompetitive'' Arguments Against Referral Payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The central argument raised by numerous commenters, including the combined comments of attorneys general of several
States, was that referral payments were a breach of the trust of prospective home purchasers, particularly in transactions
involving real estate agents and affiliated companies:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consumers expect to be treated fairly by their real estate agents and therefore trust that a referral to a settlement
service provider is based solely on their agent's knowledge of comparative prices and service features. When there
was no financial incentive for the [real estate agent], consumers were justified in thinking that they were referred
to a settlement service provider because that provider offered good service at a reasonable price, not because the
agent received a payment in exchange for the referral. This is no longer the case.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Referral payments, commenters repeatedly pointed out, permit vertically integrated real estate companies to provide
financial incentives to their employees to make all settlement service referrals to affiliated companies. As a result,
settlement service providers tied to a real estate company are ``insulated from competition on prices and services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RESPA was adopted, one commenter observed, because of Congress' recognition that the very nature of the real estate
transaction is arcane and cumbersome, and that the typical consumer lacks any comparable economic experiences.
The Consumers Federation of America (CFA) noted that the consumer has traditionally relied for assistance on the
real estate broker (who ordinarily is an agent of the seller)_a person in ``a highly privileged position of influence
over the consumer *&blank;*&blank;*.'' CFA concluded that RESPA evidences congressional recognition that this
influence can be easily abused for broker self-gain at the material expense of consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) and other commenters remarked that in the absence of referral fees, real estate
agents may be expected to afford good advice to home buyers. The real estate agent has an incentive (the prospect of
a sales commission, as well as potential business referrals and repeat business) to send a buyer to a lender offering
the best combination of service and price. However, when the person making the referral has another motive_a direct
financial interest_it becomes less clear that the agent or broker's referral will be made with the best interests
of the home buyer uppermost, the MBA asserted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to its opponents, the principal consequences of the employer-employee exemption were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Failure to refer home buyers to lenders and other settlement service providers that provide the best service and
prices; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Ultimate reduction or elimination of competition in the industry, brought about by ``unfair competition''
driving out small, independent settlement service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFA echoed the arguments of lenders, attorneys, and title insurance providers who repeatedly asserted that home
buyers lacked the experience to be sophisticated consumers:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For better or worse, consumers are simply not effective financial services shoppers *&blank;*&blank;*. Since there
is no possibility of one-stop shopping because the consumer is not shopping, the core claim of consumer benefit offered
by controlled business arrangement advocates_consumer choice_crumbles under the weight of economic reality *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although shopping may not be occurring, there is, nonetheless, the profound opportunity for `reverse competition'
created by a captive market willing to pay higher-than-market prices. What this rule champions is not one-stop shopping,
but, rather, one-stop pick-pocketing of the consumer through the multi-layers of a diversified financial services
holding company.

Commenters opposed to referral payments were not persuaded by arguments in the 1992 final rule in support of permitting
employer-employee referrals. ``What matters,'' one commenter said, ``is not that the payment is going from employer
to employee *&blank;*&blank;* [but] that there is payment for a raw referral, creating the very anti-competitive
and anti-consumer financial incentive Section 8 [of RESPA] was intended to eliminate.''

Legal Arguments Against Referral Payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Many of the same commenters who opposed referral payments on policy or economic grounds also argued that permitting
employer-employee payments for referrals directly violated the RESPA statute. CFA, after characterizing the events
that led to the Congress' 1983 controlled business arrangement amendments to RESPA, asserted that the Congress'
clear intent was to permit controlled business arrangements ``only under certain specific conditions.'' The final
rule, CFA claimed, ``grossly exceeds any reasonable interpretation of statutory authority, and *&blank;*&blank;*
has returned the settlement service marketplace_or at least the controlled business arrangement market_to the
pre-RESPA era of anti-consumer and anti-competitive brokerage steering.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBA and other commenters observed that Section 8(c)(4)(C) of RESPA states that controlled business arrangements
are permissible as long as ``the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only thing of value
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that is received from the arrangement, other than payments permitted under this subsection, is a return on the ownership
interest or franchise relationship.'' MBA argued that because the final rule permits employees to receive a ``bonus''
when they refer settlement business to affiliates, the rule ``fails to give effect to the plain language of the statute.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Arguments in Support of the Employer-Employee Exception
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several institutional commenters, along with real estate brokers, lenders, insurance companies, and vertically
integrated real estate service providers, expressed support for the employer-employee exception provided for
in &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Consumer and Community Affairs Division of the Federal Reserve System supported the rule's exemption
for employer payments to its own employees for referral services, saying that it is a ``legitimate expectation''
that an employee would make referrals for the employer and be compensated for the referrals. Prohibiting payment
for referrals, the Federal Reserve spokesperson said, would prove difficult from an enforcement standpoint, since
examiners would then be required to review employer bonus and salary policies to determine whether compensation
was based on general performance, or whether it included payments for referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Reserve spokesperson also expressed a concern related to the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C.
2901 et seq.) and to the Federal Reserve's efforts to encourage banks to refer business to community-based lenders:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* A bank may support these efforts by rewarding employees for referring potential applicants who
have not previously considered the [Community Reinvestment target] bank an accessible community lender. An adverse
interpretation by HUD of this provision could be detrimental to future innovations and developments in community
lending.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Real Estate Services Providers Council (RESPRO) pointed out that the November 2, 1992, rule makes clear that employer
payments to employees cannot be reimbursed by the party receiving the referral, or that employer payments cannot
be made to nonemployees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), although generally supportive of the final rule, urged HUD to go further
by expanding the exemption to the referral fee prohibition to allow payment for referrals to employees of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
affiliated
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 businesses. In the absence of such an expansion, CBA argued, the structure of the institution could determine whether
an employee could receive a payment for referrals. CBA urged that the difference in the legal treatment of a referral
payment based on the internal structure of a banking organization lacks any policy justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters asked for expansion of the employer payments principle to allow entities with common ownership
to pay referral fees to affiliated companies.

The Proposed Rule's Position on the Employer-Employee Exception. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department reviewed the extensive history relating to this issue, including the history of the controlled business
arrangements amendment to RESPA. In enacting Section 8 of RESPA in 1974, Congress prohibited all fees, kickbacks,
or things of value for the referral of settlement service business. The statute, as originally enacted, did not address
referrals of business to affiliated companies.

(102 Cal.App.3d 381 (2d. Dist. 1980)) reached the courts. In that case the California Insurance Commissioner refused
to grant a license to a wholly owned subsidiary of a real estate company to act as a title insurer. The denial was based
on a concept of restriction of trade. This case drew HUD and congressional attention to whether this or similar controlled
business arrangements might violate Federal law. On July 24, 1980, HUD issued an Interpretive Rule (subsequently
withdrawn) that stated that ``controlled business arrangements may be a violation of Section 8.'' (49 FR 49360; withdrawn
on May 18, 1982, 47 FR 21304.). Two days of congressional hearings were held on September 15 and 16, 1981, and, in 1983,
Congress enacted the ``controlled business arrangement'' amendment to RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1983 controlled business arrangement amendment represented a compromise between those who wanted no restrictions
on the ability of real estate settlement service professionals to refer settlement service business to entities
with which they had an ownership interest and those who wanted a blanket prohibition against such referrals. The compromise
(see H.R. Report 97&hyph;532, at page 52) made clear that controlled business arrangements do not violate RESPA_allowing
affiliated entities, such as real estate professionals, to refer settlement business to related entities_provided
that specified disclosure requirements and safeguards are satisfied, including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A requirement that the relationship between the provider of settlement services and the person making the referral
be disclosed, along with the estimated charges of the provider; (2) a bar against the required use of a particular provider,
except under certain specified exceptions under Section 8; and (3) a bar against anything of value being received
by the referring party, beyond a return on ownership interest or franchise relationship or payments otherwise permissible
under Section 8(c) of RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between the enactment of the 1983 amendments to RESPA and the issuance of the 1992 final rule, HUD had issued several
informal legal opinions concerning the extent to which employers could pay referral fees to employees. The opinions
made clear that bona fide full-time employees could be compensated for generating business for their own employers,
as this would be within the scope of their employment. These opinions also made clear that uncompensated referrals
to affiliated companies were not prohibited. These opinions did 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, broadly approve compensation to all employees for referrals to affiliated companies. In the circumstances
addressed by HUD informal opinions prior to the final rule, the permissibility of compensation of employees for referral
related activities depended upon the structure of the affiliated companies or on whether the employees were acting
within the scope of their employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 final rule went beyond any of these previous positions and created an exemption for any and all employer payments
to its own employees for referrals of business, including referrals to affiliated companies. The final rule only
retained the stricture that the company receiving the settlement business could not directly or indirectly compensate
anyone for such business. Although the rule did not limit this exemption to controlled businesses, the exemption
has little utility for entities other than affiliated companies, since it is unlikely that an employer would pay its
own employees for making referrals to unrelated individuals or companies. The preamble of the final rule set forth
the position that payments from an employer for referrals were exempt from Section 8 because a business entity acts
through its employees; the action of the employees is not sufficiently distinct from the action of the employer to
provide the requisite plurality of actors needed to violate Section 8. Although the rule permitted an employer to
compensate its own employees for referrals, it indicated that if the company receiving the referral reimbursed the
employer or the referring employees, Section 8 of RESPA would be violated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entities critical of the 1992 final rule have characterized the provision permitting employers' payments to their
own employees for referrals as broadly sanctioning referral payments. Trade and business press have frequently
restated this position without examination. Also, the Department's attention has been drawn to a number of advertisements
and mailings in which various companies have cited RESPA as authority for bogus or sham programs under which fees may
be paid to individuals who will become ``employees.'' While the final rule did not permit sham arrangements, neither
did it adequately clarify the extent of the exemption.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following a full consideration of the testimony and comments, the Secretary has concluded that the 1992 final rule's
employer-employee exemption was too broad. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to amend the final rule by withdrawing
the exemption set forth in &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of that rule. This amendment will have the effect of providing
that, while an employer may compensate its own bona fide employees for the generation of its own business, all compensation
for referrals to outside entities, including affiliates, will be prohibited under RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to withdrawing the exemption, the proposal clarifies specifically when compensation to employees runs
afoul of the requirements of RESPA. The rule provides that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No employee or agent may receive compensation from his or her employer or any other source when the compensation
is tied on a one-to-one basis to, or is calculated as a multiple of the number or value of, referrals of business to an
affiliated entity; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The compensation of agents or employees who routinely are in direct contact with the consumer may not be based
in whole or in part on the value or number of referrals made to affiliated entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These two clarifications are designed to minimize any incentive that a person in a position to make or influence a referral
might have to make a referral based on his or her own financial interests. Clearly, compensation calculated as a multiple
of the number or value of referrals creates a powerful incentive to make referrals that maximize one's own compensation.
Similarly, agents or employees who ordinarily are in direct contact with the consumer may be influenced in making
referrals if their overall performance is measured and compensation is set, even in part, based on the number or value
of referrals to affiliated entities. The proposal makes clear that RESPA prohibits such compensation. By withdrawing
the broad exemption, the potential for conflict of interest by those persons making referrals is reduced, increasing
the possibility of true competition among settlement service providers based on the cost and quality of the services
provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most facets of the settlement services business are very competitive, and the Secretary wants to assure that the rule
does nothing to harm this competitiveness. The provisions set forth above that would clarify how RESPA affects employee
compensation can be enforced and will not require HUD to interfere unduly with the internal operations of controlled
business arrangements. Because Congress has clearly ruled on the acceptability, with conditions, of controlled
business arrangements, the role of the Department is not to encourage or discourage controlled business arrangements,
but to clarify what activities between interrelated companies are permissible or not permissible under RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the withdrawal of the exemption, employees of controlled business arrangements could continue to send consumers
to affiliated companies, but they may be more likely to exercise independent judgment reflecting the interests of
the consumer if the inducement of referral-specific compensation is not present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to withdraw the exemption would obviate the need for a full examination of the question raised by some
commenters about whether the exemption in the proposed rule is contrary to the statute, particularly since the Department
has decided not to withdraw the employer-employee exemption without notice-and-comment rulemaking. In any event,
the Department believes the exemption in the final rule would be legally sustainable, because of the broad exemption
authority of the Secretary under Section 19 of RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pending this proposed rule becoming final, the existing employer-employee exemption remains operational and employer
payments made in accordance with the existing RESPA regulation will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be treated by the Department as conduct violative of the RESPA statute. However, the exemption in the existing rule
is only available for employees, not independent contractors, a class that, under the Internal Revenue Code, includes
most real estate agents and many others in the settlement services business. Those persons engaging in sham practices
in an attempt to avoid the strictures of RESPA are not protected under the 1992 final rule during the pendency of these
revisions.

 The final rule's revision of the RESPA regulations indicated that payment by a borrower for computer loan origination
services was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0124 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;prohibited by RESPA or Regulation X. This provision also drew hundreds of adverse comments, as well as support
from several commenters responding to the Department's July 6, 1993, notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters treated the CLO issue and the issue of referral payments as closely related concerns. Computer loan
origination services, these commenters claimed, often are nothing more than thinly disguised arrangements for
the referral of settlement services. The commenters argued that both referral payments and superficial or nominal
CLO services involve the ``steering'' of homebuyers to a limited choice of service providers. A number of these commenters
indicated their belief that simple disclosure of the fact that a fee is being charged affords inadequate protection
against these dangers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) entered vigorous objections to the borrower fee authorized by the final
rule. ``If there is economic value to the adoption of electronic loan origination technology, CFA believes that the
marketplace will, on its own, adopt it. There is no reason why the consumer should foot the bill for the industry's capital
investment.'' The CFA asserted that the RESPA statute was ``suspicious'' of fees for services of unknown or questionable
value, and it objected to any ``sanctioned levy against consumers for CLO services.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed their confusion concerning a CLO-related question posed to the public in the July 6,
1993, notice. The question presented was whether further clarifications or additional conditions regarding CLOs
are needed or would be desirable to protect consumers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
particularly if any payment for the CLO service comes directly or indirectly from a lender.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Emphasis supplied.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters addressing this issue said they had assumed that the final rule only permitted ``customer-pay''
systems. If lender-pay systems are permissible, these commenters claimed, a major new problem is presented. Lender-pay
systems are especially dangerous, the commenters declared, because the broker's financial gain and incentive to
steer may be totally hidden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A significant minority of the commenters (including many who otherwise opposed features of the final rule) believe
that CLO services are the wave of the future and that computer-based systems promise real benefit to prospective homebuyers.
These commenters, however, joined with other critics of the CLO provision in questioning the legitimacy of linking
CLO systems to referral fee arrangements. Others commenters objected to the final rule's failure to assure universal
access to CLOs by lenders doing business in a particular location. Hundreds of comments_predominantly from lenders
and related settlement service providers_urged that a comprehensive, limiting definition of CLO services be added
to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing an automated service provider expressed his fear that CLOs operated by real estate brokers
and agents could be used to ``display financial information [about other lenders] inferior to what [the broker's
affiliate] is offering, and charge the borrower for doing it; then use the CLO fee collected for payment of `employee
compensation' to guide the buyer to the broker-owned title company, closing service, insurance agency, home warranty
company, and pest control company. The referral fee will not come from the normal real estate commission, but instead
each service generates sufficient income to pay a referral fee to capture the next service, commencing with the CLO
fee.'' The commenter further stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Information provided through technology is not only valuable, but vital given today's complex and sophisticated
lending; but, to allow a real estate broker to charge a purchaser for providing this information without having adequate
guidelines in place assuring that the consumer will, in fact, receive information that is in the best interest of the
consumer *&blank;*&blank;* is a terrible disservice to the consumer *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters on the CLO issue had an array of suggestions for revising the RESPA regulations to limit, expand, or otherwise
control the use of homebuyer- or lender-compensated CLO services, and to add suitable definitions of the term ``CLO''.
Among these suggestions were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Creating an (unspecified) ``market mechanism'' to keep CLO fees reasonable and closely related to the true value
of the service being performed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requiring the borrower to pay for CLO services 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at the time the service is being provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (a number of commenters believed that such a requirement would help assure that the homebuyer would insist on receipt
of a ``real'' service, ``rather than unknowingly subsidize a disguised referral fee that is buried at the end of escrow'');

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Mandating that a substantial number of lender participants be included in any CLO system, and defining the term
``computer loan origination service'' in such a way as to exclude CLO providers that afford the borrower only limited
information;

(iv) Requiring CLOs operated by real estate brokers or agents to make special disclosures concerning use of CLO systems,
in greater detail than the disclosures set out in Appendix E to 24 CFR part 3500. (A large number of lender-commenters
asserted that special disclosure was unnecessary when CLOs are used by lenders, arguing that real estate brokers,
``who may be receiving another fee in the transaction,'' were the only parties for whom CLO-related disclosures should
be required.);

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) Cautioning HUD 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to permit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
lenders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to pay for CLO services (arguing that any payment coming directly or indirectly from a lender should be subject to the
anti-kickback provisions of Section 8 of RESPA). While the 1992 final rule addressed only the issue of fees paid by
borrowers, commenters also discussed the issue of fees paid by lenders for inclusion on CLO systems, in response to
the invitation for such comments in the July 6, 1993, notice. Most commenters referred to such payments as thinly disguised
referral fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Requiring disclosure that particular CLO listings provide only partial information about available loans.
(A few commenters urged that the CLO fee disclosure form include ``bold print'' disclosing that the same information
could be acquired by the prospective homebuyer ``for free'' by shopping on their own.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Recognizing that CLO services, if performed by a real estate broker or agent for a homebuyer, create a conflict
of interest and a ``potentiality for fraud'' for the broker or agent, whose fiduciary duty is to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
seller.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unified comments from 16 State Attorneys General asserted that the use of CLOs by real estate agents is analogous to
the situation once prevalent in the travel industry:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* where independent travel agents using computer reservation services steered travelers to whichever
airline happened to own the computer system used by the travel agent. Those flights were not always the most convenient
or cheapest for the consumer. Private antitrust enforcement actions were required to rein in these practices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Attorneys General declared that the economic costs of these airline-industry practices are ``trivial compared
to the costs to consumers if CLOs are used to steer consumers in large numbers to more expensive mortgages than are readily
available [elsewhere] in the market.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Suggesting that (in defining a CLO system) HUD require equal access to the system by any lender requesting access;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Urging that fees for CLO services be proscribed because access to lender information has, before, been a free
service performed by real estate agents or brokers; thus CLO charges would ``create a new fee for no real [new] value
or service provided;'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Arguing that borrower information achieved through the CLO process was near-worthless, because lenders will
have to reverify any information provided before underwriting loan applications; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Requiring that the CLO disclosure (and acknowledgement) occur before the borrower agrees to use computer loan
origination services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these recommendations from multiple commenters, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) recommended
specific modifications to &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(iii): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(one) Prohibiting the receipt of compensation for operating a CLO by any person who already receives compensation
for the same transaction in another capacity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(two) Defining ``computer loan origination services'' in a manner that would require interactive communication
with the computer systems and the listing of multiple lenders upon request and for no charge; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(three) If the first two recommendations are not accepted by HUD, requiring that the CLO fee be both disclosed and paid
for before the CLO is accessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBA also urged that the rule set out the principle that the mere performance of ``clerical loan origination activities,
most or all of which will have to be repeated by the lender'' does not constitute a service justifying the collection
of a fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments Supportive of the CLO Provision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments in support of the CLO provision of the rule were varied. In general, these comments urged retention of the
final rule's disclosure-based authorization of CLOs and CLO charges to borrowers. However, supporters of the CLO
provision and other commenters on the provision expressed considerable sentiment that substantial clarification
of the rule was necessary in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters observed that the rule was silent on the question of what disclosure (if any) would be required
if the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
borrower
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was not charged a fee for access to a CLO service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter ventured that, evidently, the rule's silence on the issue would indicate that no disclosure would be
required when, for example, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
lender
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 paid CLO-connected fees. While the commenter approved this result, he added that ``further clarification would
be welcome.'' The comment recommended that no separate disclosure be required for lender-pay or for ``no charge''
CLO services_even where it was clear that no-fee CLO systems were being paid for out of loan origination fees or lump-sum
fees that are charged to lenders and mortgage brokers to process and underwrite mortgage loan applications. In these
instances, the commenter maintained, the CLO services were less like traditional settlement services and more like
services purchased by a settlement service provider to help it perform its normal functions_``back office'' loan
origination services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general remarks, the same commenter argued that overregulation of CLO services would stifle innovation and competitiveness.
It was pointed out that one of the major advantages of CLO services was the expansion of housing opportunity ``into
sectors of the U.S. economy not now adequately served by the mortgage lending industry.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that, with the very recent revision of &sect;3500.14(g)(2)(iii), the Department
should not make immediate changes, but should allow the marketplace to develop and experiment with CLOs without additional
regulation. However, in a number of instances commenters supportive of the final rule's treatment of CLO services
joined opponents in requesting that HUD provide clarifications of the rule that would: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Define the term ``computer loan origination services''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Indicate whether payment for CLO services must come solely from borrowers, or whether lender-paid services
are permitted; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Advise whether there exists an ``implicit limitation'' on the fees that can be paid to CLO providers (such as
a reasonable relationship to the market value of the services performed).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other pro-rule commenters joined commenters that had objections to the CLO services provision in supporting an explicit
requirement that the CLO fee disclosure statement be given to the borrower 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
before
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the fee is imposed, and that the fee be paid to the CLO operator 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
before
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 services are performed. ``By requiring upfront disclosure and payment,'' one commenter observed, ``the borrower
will be aware that a separate fee is being imposed for services not required by the mortgage lender and will be able to
determine whether the services provided by the CLO operator merit such a fee.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the subordinate issue of the number of lenders included on CLOs, commenters supporting the CLO provision generally
differed with opponents, many of whom urged much closer regulation of this aspect. The pro-CLO services commenters
generally advocated ``leaving to the marketplace'' the determination of how many lenders were appropriate for a
CLO service. One commenter argued that dictating how many lenders must appear on the CLO system ``is another example
of well-intentioned regulation which could ultimately hurt consumers.'' The commenter pointed out that individual
lenders may want to develop competing CLO products, each marketing its own software products, with the CLO operator
then having access to several single-lender CLOs. The commenter concluded, as did several other supporters of the
final rule's CLO services provision, that a consumer provided with full disclosure can determine the services for
which the consumer is willing to pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters anticipated adverse comment on the CLO systems issue and urged the Department not to bend to those
commenters who would impose limitations on fees for CLO services or would require that fees be collected up-front.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter whose overall position strongly supported the final rule took a position comparable to many anti-CLO
commenters in several respects. To protect consumers this commenter supported the imposition of additional conditions
relating to CLO systems, such as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Up-front disclosure of the CLO fee, and payment in advance of the performance of services; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A regulatory requirement that real estate brokers be required to perform services ``beyond electronically
providing a menu of lenders' interest rates and products.'' The same commenter, however, joined other CLO services
proponents in urging that HUD should not attempt to regulate the number of lenders to be included in CLOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, evidently the operator of a large, independent computer loan origination system, made several points
from that perspective:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The commenter's independent CLO system avoided ``steering'' abuses because steering arises when lenders offer
commissioned loan officers or mortgage brokers a larger commission on some products than on others, thus encouraging
lenders to sell a particular type of loan. The commenter's system required uniform charges across loan products and
lenders, which are established by contract among participants and monitored by the CLO service provider;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The system encourages competitive loan pricing, by including a wide variety of information affecting the overall
cost of a loan to a consumer and making it simple for a loan counselor to find the ``best deal'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The system increases competition in rural areas, by expanding the number of lenders offering loans;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The system helps to avoid racial and other forms of discrimination against borrowers by making the loan-decision
process ``demonstrably race-blind'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The system avoids the criticism that CLO systems are mere ``kickback schemes,'' because the loan counselors working
with the system perform full loan-origination functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter recommended that RESPA be revised to stipulate that real estate brokers may not charge for origination
services (implicitly, CLO services) unless they actually register a loan commitment with the lender. ``This assures
that the [broker] has at least qualified the borrower, and made a loan selection with the borrower's concurrence.
These are non-trivial functions for which a payment is justified,'' the commenter said. The commenter favored this
``functional'' test, as opposed to a regulatory limitation on the number of CLO services provided or a ban on single-lender
CLOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments from real estate brokers stated their support for the CLO services provision of the final rule. Among
these, at least two real estate broker commenters assumed that CLO services would involve multiple lenders:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[I assume that] all CLOs will offer the rates and costs of many lenders. When lenders realize that they are in competition
with other lenders, they will be forced to deliver the best rates at the lowest cost *&blank;*&blank;*. I can assure
you that if a home buyer walks into a lender's office to obtain a loan, there is little chance that lender would send the
buyer to a competitor even though the rates and costs may be lower.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second real estate broker described his company's CLO service as having access to an affiliate and 20 competitors,
indicating that this variety and choice afforded borrowers with distinct advantages over borrower-initiated loan
shopping.

Description of the Legal Framework for Analysis of Payments for CLO Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has found that the use of the term ``CLO exemption'' in the preamble of the 1992 final rule may have created certain
misperceptions. To ensure that there is no confusion about the scope of the regulatory exemption proposed below,
the Department believes that it will be helpful to set out the legal framework for its analysis of payments for CLO services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the provision of CLO services may be financed by the operator of a CLO system in several ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The operator could charge lenders to have information about their products displayed on the CLO system;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The operator could charge borrowers to use the CLO system;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The operator could charge both lenders and borrowers; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The operator could provide the service free of charge to both lenders and borrowers in the belief that providing
the service will attract more customers for the operator's related settlement service business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8(a) of RESPA prohibits a lender from paying a CLO operator a referral fee. Section 8(b) of RESPA prohibits
a CLO operator from accepting a payment from a borrower ``other than for services actually performed.'' Therefore,
in the absence of any regulatory exemption, under RESPA:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(one) Payments by a lender to a CLO operator are subject to scrutiny to determine whether the payment is a referral fee
or is bona fide compensation for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(two) Payments by a borrower to a CLO operator are subject to scrutiny to determine whether the payment is a sham or duplicative
charge, rather than a payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or services actually performed; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(three) When neither borrowers nor lenders pay a fee for the CLO services, only certain disclosures are required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 final rule created an exemption from Section 8 for ``any payment by a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
borrower
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for computer loan origination services,'' as long as certain disclosures were provided (emphasis added). This rule
did not address payments made by lenders, thus leaving such payments subject to Section 8 scrutiny. Although the term
``CLO exemption'' is frequently used, including in the preamble of the 1992 final rule, the exemption was not for the
CLO itself, but only for payments made for CLO services by borrowers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters were concerned about whether any system that merely claimed to be a CLO deserved to be given an exemption
from RESPA's requirements. As noted in the above statement of HUD's objective, the Department seeks to encourage
the use of new technology in ways that provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Uncertainty about
how RESPA applies to CLOs may inhibit their development. Therefore, the Department has determined that continuation
of such an exemption is justified; however, the Department seeks to limit the exemption only to payments for access
to CLO systems that provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Payments for access to systems that
provide such benefits will not be subject to scrutiny under Section 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend the 1992 final rule to limit the exemption to payments made by borrowers
for services from ``qualified CLOs'' only, and to define qualified CLOs to be those systems that the Department believes
provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Payments by borrowers for services of systems other than
``qualified'' CLOs are not prohibited; rather those payments are subject to scrutiny under the Section 8 test articulated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the 1992 final rule did not mention payments made by lenders to CLO operators. However, having proposed
to limit the scope of the exemption for borrower payments and certain lender payments, the Department asks commenters
to address whether a parallel exemption for payments made by lenders to operators of ``qualified CLOs'' would be in
the best interest of consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Position of the Proposed Rule on CLOs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon a review of the comments and testimony on this issue, the Secretary concluded that the potential of CLOs
to be convenient and provide consumers with meaningful information about their choices justified the encouragement
of certain CLOs and the continuation of an exemption for borrower payments for certain CLOs. The Secretary also determined
that it is necessary to amend the rule to define the type of CLO for which borrower payments are permitted without further
RESPA scrutiny, in order to maximize the potential consumer benefits from this developing technology and protect
consumers. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to amend the rule to provide that payments made by borrowers for qualified
CLO services only are exempt, and to define qualified CLOs as those systems meeting the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Qualified CLOs must be responsive to information about the borrower and provide information regarding loan options
for that borrower. (This provision is responsive to commenters who feared that without definition, a system using
FAX-transmitted data or even telephone calls might qualify as a CLO system.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Qualified CLOs must meet certain fair participation and display requirements, including that participation
and display of loan products from numerous lenders offering various loan products must be allowed, factors for selecting
lenders to participate on the CLO system be fair and legitimate; and information on individual loan products must
be displayed in a lender-neutral manner. While the Department recognizes that there are practical limits on the number
of lenders that can be included usefully on a system, because of technological and other limitations, the proposed
rule contemplates that a minimum of 20 lenders will participate on a qualified CLO system. (The Department asks for
comments on whether this number is appropriate or another number would better ensure competition while providing
a meaningful level of information to the consumer.) The exemption is still available when less than 20 lenders choose
to participate, as long as the CLO system remains open to and accepts additional lenders. Selection of lenders for
participation must be done as a result of the fair application of impartial criteria, which may include, but are not
limited to, the date of the lender's application for participation on the CLO system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 first-come, first-served), the quality of services and capabilities a lender provides to consumers, the types of
loan products offered by a lender and its pricing practices, and the extent to which a lender's participation will
increase the variety of loan products offered to consumers by the system. (The application of factors may not be used
to avoid the 20 lender requirement.) CLO system operators must have a reasonable justification supported by documentation
for selection decisions. No lender may be favored or disfavored by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
manner
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which information regarding the lender or its products is presented to the borrower or is utilized on the system,
or by the scope of information that a particular lender is permitted to include as compared to another lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Qualified CLOs must provide borrowers with a CLO disclosure form that states that use of the system is not required,
space on the system is limited, the full range of products meeting the borrowers' needs may not be listed on the system,
and other lenders not listed on the system may offer better terms and conditions including lower rates. A disclosure
format for this and other information is set forth in the proposed rule as Appendix E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Qualified CLOs must charge borrowers the same fee for the same CLO service or the same components of service. The
exemption does not attempt to fix a price for CLO services; market forces and market experiences should continue to
shape the evolution and development of qualified CLO systems. Rather, where fees are charged, all borrowers must
be treated equally. If fees are waived by a CLO provider, they must be waived fairly and not because of the choice of a
particular lender. If the fee is contingent on use of a loan product on the system, the contingency must apply equally
to all loan products and lenders on the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) An operator of a qualified CLO may also charge lenders for access to the system and for a portion of maintenance and
operation costs of the system. However, the schedule of charges for each lender on the system must be identical. Furthermore,
qualified CLOs must disclose to the borrower, on the form prescribed in Appendix E and on the HUD&hyph;1 or the HUD&hyph;1A,
the amount of any anticipated payments by a lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Fees and disclosures about the CLO system must also be prominently displayed and visible to the potential borrower
on the premises near where the CLO terminal is located. The information that more advantageous loan alternatives
may exist that are not displayed on the system must be similarly disclosed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vii) Any borrower payment to a CLO operator for use of a qualified CLO must be paid outside of and before closing. A borrower
must receive full disclosure of the amount of the fee before the CLO services are performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed rule, the Department is establishing the minimum requirements that must be met by a qualified CLO
system if payments by a borrower to the operator of the system are to enjoy an exemption from RESPA. The Department believes
that these requirements are responsive to the many comments on CLOs, and that compliance with the requirements will
assure that: CLO systems receiving the benefit of the exemption are operated fairly; these systems will not be used
as disguised means of steering borrowers to particular lenders on a basis other than the quality of services provided;
and lenders wishing to participate in qualified CLO systems will be permitted to do so on a fair and equitable basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this proposed rule would continue and augment certain requirements for all providers of CLO services,
whether or not the CLO is a qualified CLO. In all circumstances where a CLO is utilized, the CLO disclosure set forth
in Appendix E must be provided to borrowers before the CLO services are performed. The existence of any controlled
business arrangement involving the operator of a CLO and any participating lender must be disclosed to the borrower
before the system is utilized. Similarly, lender payments to other settlement service providers for CLO services
must continue to be disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate and on the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A, in accordance with the
February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505) revision of the regulations, and the possibility of such payments must be noted on the
CLO disclosure.

Questions and comments on this proposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In formulating the final rule, the Department may modify the requirements for the exemption, based on comments from
the public. The Department seeks public comment on all aspects of its proposal to limit the exemption for borrower
payments to payments made for qualified CLOs, including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Does the approach embodied in this proposal_establishing a safe harbor for borrower payments for qualified systems,
continuing to scrutinize borrower payments for nonqualified systems under RESPA, and mandating certain disclosures
for all systems_the best approach to encourage the use of technology to benefit consumers and, at the same time, protect
consumers from unfair practices? Instead, should the Department provide that any payment for a CLO system that does
not qualify for the safe harbor is presumed to violate RESPA? (Commenters who believe that there should be broader
prohibitions should detail the legal and other justifications for this belief.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Would establishment of a parallel exemption for payments made by lenders to operators of qualified CLOs be in
the best interest of consumers? If so, should the requirements for a lender payment CLO exemption be the same as the
requirements for the borrower payment exemption? Those commenters who believe the requirements should be different
should specify what differences they recommend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Are most CLO systems likely to be financed using borrower payments, lender payments, or a combination of both?
Will any CLO system provide access to the system to lenders and borrowers free of charge? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Are the benefits of having borrower payments exempt from RESPA scrutiny sufficient to encourage CLO operators
to develop qualified CLOs? Will CLO operators prefer to be subject to the general test under RESPA that borrower payments
must be in exchange for services actually performed or to meet the requirements for qualified CLOs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) Issue 3: Preemption of State Laws or Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;3500.13(b)(2), the November 2, 1992, final rule provided that ``in determining whether provisions of State
law or regulations concerning controlled business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Secretary
may not construe those provisions that impose more stringent limitations on controlled business arrangements as
inconsistent with RESPA so long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.'' In connection with
the preemption issue, the Department's July 6, 1993, notice requested comments on establishing standards to be used
in evaluating whether provisions in State laws provide greater protection to consumers. The Department also invited
any other comment relative to the preemption provision of the 1992 final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Positions Taken by Commenters Critical of the Rule's Preemption Policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the Department received hundreds of comments addressing the preemption question, this issue attracted fewer
expressions of opinion than did the other three issues raised in the July 6, 1993, notice. Most of the commenters addressing
the issue (excluding identical-form responses) were attorneys or major institutional commenters. However, even
among the comments from organizations representing institutional interests or segments of the real estate and real
estate finance industries, preemption was the least-frequently addressed of the four issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters who were critical of other aspects of the rule had a mixed approach to the preemption issue and reflected
suspicion of the Department's motives. These comments assumed that, despite the benign phrasing of &sect;3500.13(b)(2),
HUD would (in light of the other features of the 1992 final rule) use preemption in the future to weaken State-initiated
regulation of controlled business arrangements. Those commenters who shared this suspicion varied in their recommendations
for improvement of the rule's preemption feature. Several commenters advised HUD to provide ``greater clarity''
regarding a State's right to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ban 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or closely regulate controlled business arrangements. Other commenters referenced particular existing State
laws that require controlled business entities to seek a substantial portion of their business from sources other
than their affiliated entities. These commenters urged that HUD provide explicitly that State laws and regulations
of this type would not be subject to preemption.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tone of these comments suggested that the standard set out in the final rule_i.e., no preemption, so long as a State
law affords ``more protection to consumers and/or competition''_ was insufficient assurance against Federal preemption.
Apparently the final rule was perceived by the commenters as being ``anti-consumer'' in the guise of a consumer protection
regulation. The commenters believed it was clear that State laws forcing controlled businesses to draw business
from nonaffiliates should 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
never
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be preempted under RESPA authority. The commenters were not persuaded that the Department intended to apply &sect;3500.13(b)(2)
in a manner that would treat these State laws as ``pro-consumer''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerned commenters made diverse recommendations: several asked the Department to clarify in the rule that preemption
would not be applied; other commenters, clearly equally averse to preemption of State laws, recommended case-by-case
judgments regarding preemption, using the existing standard set out in &sect;3500.13(b)(2). These latter commenters
often combined their 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
recommendation with an urging that HUD modify or reverse positions taken on the employer-employee exception or CLO
issues. Their thrust was that HUD's preemption policy would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be objectionable if the RESPA rule were modified to cure the specific problems being addressed by commenters in their
accompanying remarks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combined comment of the 16 State Attorneys General stated the belief that it would be too difficult to ``define
criteria for preemption in the abstract.'' The comment recommended a case-by-case approach. (Again, this comment
was made in the context of a strong statement of opposition to the final rule's employer-employee fee policy and CLO
exemption.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The predominant position of institutional commenters addressing the preemption issue was that it is unnecessary
for HUD to set out strict standards to evaluate whether State law provisions provide greater protection to the consumer.
However, there was considerable sentiment in favor of regulatory ``clarifications'' to serve, in essence, as guarantees
that the Department would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 preempt State laws in any instance where its goal was to limit controlled business arrangements. Consumers Union
believed that HUD's own rules should be changed to afford consumers stronger protections, but, if this was not to be,
``at the very least States should be free to protect their own consumers''. Accordingly, Consumers Union favored
the enunciation of standards for determining whether State law provisions provide greater protection: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* These standards are necessary since the final rule is anti-consumer, but was presented as if it
were pro-consumer. To eliminate any resulting ambiguity, HUD should clarify that [State-originated] rules totally
eliminating any incentive to steer business to an affiliate would be viewed as stronger consumer protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A large number of comments received from individuals and small businesses (mainly lenders) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
favored
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the establishment of written standards for the evaluation of State laws. However, these comments offered no specific
advice concerning the content of the favored written standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments submitted by the American Land Title Association (ALTA) claimed that the November 1992 rule on preemption
had ``frightened'' State legislators and regulators ``into believing that the RESPA disclosure provisions [would
be read by HUD to] preempt more stringent state legislation or regulations.'' The ALTA expressed the belief that the
new regulations were ``perverting'' congressional policy regarding the circumstances warranting preemption.
The ALTA further claimed that the preemption provision suggests that ``only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if the Secretary of HUD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 determines that a state controlled business provisions gives more protection to consumers and competition would
the state provisions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be preempted.'' (Emphasis in original.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ALTA also complained that the final rule was deterring State governments from considering more stringent regulation
of controlled business, and suggested that the Department support legislative revisions to RESPA to replace ``ineffective''
consumer disclosure requirements with Federal ``public business'' requirements (i.e., requirements that controlled
businesses derive a significant proportion of their business from nonaffiliates).

One of the Federal agencies commenting on the rule, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), suggested that separate
review standards for preemption determinations were unnecessary and that HUD could employ a case-by-case analysis,
using the review method outlined in &sect;3500.13(c) of the final rule. (OTS submitted comments critical of the final
rule on the referral fee and CLO issues.)

Positions Taken by Supporters of the Preemption Provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As in the case of commenters critical of the final rule, supporters of the rule commented less frequently on the preemption
issue than any of the other questions raised in the July 6, 1993, notice. However, there was perhaps a greater gulf between
supporters of the 1992 final rule and its opponents on this issue than on any other. As indicated earlier in this preamble,
opponents of the rule expressed widespread fear that the Department would use its preemption power to nullify what
the opponents perceived as salutary State regulation of controlled business. Proponents of the final rule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
also
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 read &sect;3500.13(b)(2) of the rule as promising extensive HUD employment of preemption; however, these commenters
welcomed it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters regarded RESPA as sufficient to provide consumers with protection against unfair pricing by settlement
service providers. Often, the commenters claimed, State laws that purport to be protective of consumers are actually
designed to benefit local settlement service providers, by hindering the entry of larger, broad-based providers
into local markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters appeared to assume that the chief intended target of preemption would be State laws directly or indirectly
preventing real estate brokers from owning affiliated title businesses, prohibiting mortgage lenders from affiliating
with title agencies, or restricting the percentage of business that can be derived from referrals from affiliated
businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A lender with nationwide business objected strongly to the inefficiencies it said resulted from multiple and inconsistent
State law requirements. While these varying requirements are justified if they provide identifiable consumer benefits,
the commenter said, they frequently represent attempts to limit competition among lenders, and actually increase
the costs paid by consumers.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The experience in Kansas is instructive. After the state enacted a law limiting referrals to affiliated entities,
many title agent affiliates of real estate brokers and mortgage companies were forced out of business. Freed from
the need to compete with such providers, we understand that independent title agents increased their rates by approximately
60%. The Department need look no further than this example to recognize that protection of ``turf,'' rather than protection
of consumers, is normally at the heart of such limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter went on to urge that HUD make clear that State limitations affecting controlled business arrangements
are preempted by RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that RESPA regulations encourage nationwide service providers to diversify their product offerings
and enter new geographic markets. Accordingly, Federal preemption of adverse State laws would result in increased
competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While a few commenters appeared to be recommending summary preemption of the array of State laws affecting controlled
business, other commenters, responding to the Department's direct question, urged the establishment of standards
for the case-by-case determination of whether State laws or regulations are inconsistent with RESPA in the controlled
business area, i.e., whether a particular law ``give(s) more protection to consumers and/or competition'' than
does RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the final rule's treatment of preemption should be fundamentally changed because it
is ``unclear and vaguely worded'': ``What is meant by `stringent limitations' and `give more protection to *&blank;*&blank;*
competition?''' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter cited the legislative history of the 1983 RESPA amendments as indicating Congress' expectation
that, if necessary to protect consumers or encourage competition, HUD would recommend further legislation to place
a percentage limitation on the amount of controlled business that could be transacted. The commenter observed that
in the ten years since the controlled business exemption became law, HUD has not recommended further legislation
in this area. Additionally, the commenter claimed, many State governments have not seen the necessity of enacting
restrictions on the percentage of business that can be derived from affiliated entities. The commenter concluded
that State ``percentage of business'' laws were inconsistent with RESPA and should be preempted as anticompetitive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based upon the comments and testimony, the Secretary has determined that it is unnecessary at this time to set out specific
written standards for preemption of State laws. As numerous commenters, including the State Attorneys General,
observed, setting out comprehensive and informative preemption standards presents an almost insurmountable task,
in the absence of a wide array of specific fact situations that are raising preemption issues. If it becomes necessary
to consider this issue further, the Secretary may reopen the issue by rulemaking or deal with specific preemption
issues by means of interpretive rules. No amendments are proposed on this subject in this rule.

In &sect;3500.15(b)(1) of the 1992 final rule, provision was made for ``written disclosure, in the format of the Controlled
Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part.'' This disclosure referred to certain
information regarding the ownership and financial relationships between referring and referred-to parties, as

Comments Critical of the Disclosure Statement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A majority of the commenters expressing dissatisfaction with one or more features of the 1992 final rule's employer
payments provisions also objected to the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set out in Appendix
D to part 3500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, these objections were twofold. First, commenters argued that even the best and most complete form of disclosure
imaginable was not an effective means of coping with what the commenters perceived as anticonsumer aspects of controlled
business arrangements. Second, opposition commenters urged that if, against their advice, HUD continued to sanction
referral payments by employers to employees, the form of disclosure required should be strengthened substantially,
and the timing of the required disclosure should be pinpointed for maximum effect in affording consumers a realistic
opportunity to choose alternative settlement service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More than 800 comments from lenders and settlement attorneys urged expansion of the controlled business disclosure
to assure that borrowers understand that the referral ``will provide a financial benefit to the related parties.''

HUD notes that the Appendix D disclosure format already requires: (1) Disclosure of the nature of the relationship
between the referring party and the prospective provider of the service, including ownership or other financial
interests; (2) estimates of the charges for the service or services; and (3) a statement that the consumer ``may be
able to get these services at a lower rate by shopping with other settlement service providers.'' (57 FR 49600, 49622;
November 2, 1992.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Perhaps the most comprehensive criticism of the disclosure policy was expressed by the 16 State Attorneys General
in their comments. After criticizing both the referral payments provision and the CLO exemption, the Attorneys General
said that they were skeptical that disclosures can remedy the inherent dangers to consumers when there are financial
incentives for referrals of business. Conceding that the 1983 RESPA amendments expressly permitted controlled
business arrangements, the Attorneys General urged that the disclosure contemplated by the regulatory amendment
``be as clear and explicit as possible to alert consumers to the potential for harm.'' The comment advocated that the
disclosure form state with greater clarity the purpose for which a disclosure is made and the harm against which it
is aimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the State Attorneys General criticized as vague the form's reference to a ``business relationship''
and advocated the inclusion of a statement that, in making the referral to the controlled business, the referring
company or agent (to be identified by name) would benefit ``financially or otherwise.'' The State Attorneys General
wanted the form to indicate that, in addition to lower rates, consumers might receive ``better services'' by shopping
around. ``Indeed, consumers must be affirmatively encouraged to shop around *&blank;*&blank;* consumers should
be warned in clear, unambiguous language of the pitfalls of relying on a controlled business referral and encouraged
to make intelligent choices among settlement service providers.'' Consumers should also be told in explicit terms,
the comment continued, that they are ``free to choose [their] own settlement service provider and will not be denied
any services or loan for exercising this choice.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the State Attorneys General favored disclosure of the ``existence of and amounts of'' any fees or kickbacks
paid, directly or indirectly, to the real estate broker or another referring party, or to an affiliated provider,
for the performance of settlement services. A large number of individual commenters and the Coalition to Retain Independent
Services in Settlements (CRISIS) echoed this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CFA disparaged disclosure, by itself, as being an ``inadequate remedy for the market risks that consumers are
exposed to in the purchase of real estate'':
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's rule has placed before the consumer a new array of fees for which the delivery of the equivalent of
a tollgate ticket is hardly ample protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the central problems of controlled business arrangements is that the underlying purchase is carried out under
conditions of urgency and stress that will always overwhelm a captive consumer. The ability to distinguish between
what must be done_and purchased_and what is optional, is limited. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MBA advocated elimination of the employer-employee referral fee exception, but urged that, at least, the disclosure
form should be expanded to include the existence and amount of the referral fee. Similar advice was received from Consumers
Union and from individual commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC also expressed some doubt about the efficacy of written disclosure, calling the disclosure form ``just one
of dozens of confusing papers handed to [consumers] over the course of a real estate transaction.'' FDIC nevertheless
advocated strengthening the form by requiring the disclosing entity to meet specific content guidelines and to use
layman's language, ``*&blank;*&blank;* so less opportunity [is] given for `creative writing'.'' The FDIC also
advocated the use of an acknowledgement line or box on the form, to show that the consumer had read and understood the
controlled business arrangement disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), while expressing concern about employer-employee referral fees and the
efficacy of CLO disclosures, commented that the content and timing requirements for controlled business disclosures,
as set out in the final rule, seemed adequate to protect consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Departing from the recommendations of other commenters to the effect that the disclosure form should be expanded
to highlight the presence of referral fees and other relationships between the referrer and the service provider,
ALTA's spokesman called the disclosure process ``worthless as a consumer protection measure in the settlement services
arena.'' The ALTA claimed that the consumer is likely to rely upon the recommendation of a trusted professional, ``even
where a personal financial inducement is disclosed.'' ALTA's spokesman advocated legislative solutions, including
amendment of RESPA to permit a competitor's right of action and the institution of blanket prohibitions on controlled
businesses.

Comments from Supporters of the Final Rule's Disclosure Statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received detailed comments on controlled business disclosure policy from more than a dozen commenters
who supported the final rule in most of its particulars. Typically, these commenters believed that the form and level
of detail of disclosure of controlled business arrangements that were in the final rule were ``more than adequate''
to permit informed choice by consumers concerning settlement service providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters pointed out that the required form of disclosure appeared to exceed the statutory disclosure
requirements in several respects. One, the commenters urged that the statute required only that the ``existence''
of a financial interest be disclosed, while the regulation required that the disclosure outline the ``ownership
and financial interest.'' Two, the regulation requires that all disclosures, not just those related to costs, be
made in writing. Three, the regulations require 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
separate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 disclosure of controlled business relationships. Finally, the ``suggested format'' for the disclosure (although
not the regulation itself) includes the caution: ``You may be able to get these services at a lower rate by shopping
with other settlement service providers.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters who raised these points did not address them as objections to, or criticisms of, the 1992 final rule.
Instead, these observations were cited as indications that, in the commenters' views, the rule already was suitably
attentive to consumer protection concerns, in that it went beyond bare-bones statutory disclosure requirements.
Several of these comments went on to urge that the Department continue to limit its RESPA regulations to disclosure-related
concerns, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bend to the will of advocates of other methods of regulating or curbing controlled business arrangements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
RESPA is predicated on the belief that consumers, when provided with appropriate disclosures, are capable of making
informed decisions. Those who argue otherwise frequently do so only to protect their competitive position, not to
advance the interests of consumers. *&blank;*&blank;* [T]he information contained in the existing controlled
business arrangement disclosures is sufficient and the requirements should not be disturbed.

The Federal Reserve Board's comment agreed that the controlled business disclosure policy set out in the rule and
the format were ``more than adequate'' as disclosures. ``*&blank;*&blank;* [I]f anything, it may be over-disclosing
given the quantity of information that a consumer receives when applying for a mortgage loan.'' A few lender-commenters
expressed a similar view. The Federal Reserve suggested that the consumer needs to know that the two parties involved
in the referral are related, but may not need further details. While the Federal Reserve agreed it is important that
the consumer know that use of the provider is not required, it suggested that including the estimated charges for the
service was ``redundant,'' since such costs would have been disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One lender argued that controlled business arrangements arise in a variety of situations, and that it is ``impossible''
to mandate the use of a form that is suitable for all providers in all situations. The commenter asked the Department
to provide for flexibility concerning format, ``as long as consumers are informed of the referral and the relationship
between the parties.''

The same commenter, a lender, asked for more flexibility in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
timing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the controlled business disclosure. Many referrals do not occur at face-to-face meetings between the consumer
and the referring party, the commenter suggested, and asked that the rule clarify that the service provider be required
to furnish a disclosure ``at the time of the initial contact between the consumer and the provider.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment urged that the controlled business disclosure form 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be required for disclosure of the specific providers of ``lender required services such as credit reports, appraisals,
[or] flood plain searches.'' The commenter suggested that early disclosure of the identity of these providers was
impractical and provided ``absolutely no benefit to the consumer.'' The information, the commenter concluded,
would appear on the HUD&hyph;1 Settlement Statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most frequent criticism of the rule's controlled business disclosure requirements from commenters supportive
of the rule was that, in some instances, it was unclear when a controlled business arrangement was required to be disclosed.
Several commenters asked whether the disclosure was required when a bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary mortgage
company or when a mortgage company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the same holding company as the bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situations in which related businesses were required to make disclosure also were questioned. One commenter
asked whether, if a bank is affiliated with a mortgage company by common ownership, the bank has to make disclosures
to consumers in the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When a consumer is directly referred to the mortgage company for a mortgage loan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When the consumer is simply informed of the availability of loans from the mortgage company; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When the bank includes references to the mortgage company in its advertising or its brochures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, stating that the entire category of ``referrals'' was not intended to fall within the coverage of the
controlled business arrangement rules, recommended creation of an exemption to the controlled business arrangement
rules for ```referrals' between bank holding companies' wholly-owned subsidiaries.'' Two commenters asserted
that failing to provide this exemption would be placing mortgage companies within bank holding companies at a competitive
disadvantage when compared to bank mortgage departments. ``The purpose of RESPA is not to dictate the form in which
a bank structures its lending business.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Position Taken in the Proposed Rule on the Controlled Business Disclosure Statement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary concluded that the elimination of the employer-employee exception would, in turn, eliminate a number
of the strongest concerns regarding the information in the controlled business disclosure. However, the Secretary
has accepted some suggestions for modifications to the disclosure as useful and beneficial to the consumer. Accordingly,
certain of these suggestions have been included in the proposed rule and in the format of Appendix D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggested borrower-acknowledgement box has been added to the controlled business disclosure format. Additional
plain language has been added to the format. Section 3500.15(b) proposes a requirement that disclosure be given at
a time to be relevant to the consumer: either (i) at the time of referral or no earlier than 3 days before; or (ii) if the
lender requires the use of a particular provider, the time of the loan application. The preamble of revisions that
extended RESPA coverage to subordinate lien transactions (59 FR 6505, 6510, February 10, 1994) also discussed the
appropriateness of disclosures, stating that ``incidental and uncompensated referrals, such as brochures in a
bank lobby or street directions given by a bank employee, are not perceived as rising to the level necessary to require
a controlled business disclosure.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More sweeping modification of the controlled business disclosure form is not considered necessary. While many commenters
disparaged the use of written disclosure as a means of coping with perceived controlled business-related problems,
the Department continues to believe that full disclosure is useful as a means of informing consumers. Disclosure
is also a preeminent principle of the RESPA statute.

include, but are not limited to, the date of the lender's application for participation on the qualified CLO system,
the quality of services and capabilities the lender provides to consumers, the types of loan products offered by the
lender and its pricing practices, and the extent to which the lender's participation will increase the variety of
loan products offered to consumers by the system. Qualified CLO system owners shall have a reasonable justification

 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system and the qualified CLO system shall provide borrowers with information in
a neutral manner. No lender shall be favored or disfavored by the manner in which information regarding the lender
or its products is utilized or is presented to the borrower, is used on the system, or is presented by the CLO operators,
or by the scope of information that one lender is permitted to include as compared to another lender. No payments, disincentives,
or penalties may be provided directly or indirectly to CLO operators of qualified CLO systems by any person, including
the CLO operator's employer, to influence the CLO operator to favor any lender on the qualified CLO system.

(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure Statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall provide a CLO disclosure form to the borrower before CLO services are
performed. The CLO operator shall require the borrower to sign on the CLO disclosure form an acknowledgment that the
borrower has received the disclosure. An enlarged, completed copy of the CLO disclosure form (no smaller than 16''
by 20''), including any applicable fee, shall be displayed prominently within 5 feet of the CLO terminal. The CLO disclosure
form shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Be in the format established in Appendix E of this part; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Specify the fee and services being provided; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Include statements that use of the system is not required; space on the system is limited; the full range of products
meeting the borrower's needs may not be listed on the system; and other lenders not listed on the system may offer better
terms and conditions, including lower rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CLO Access Fee.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall charge all borrowers using the qualified CLO system the same CLO access
fee(s) for the same service or the same components of service. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall require
the borrower to pay any CLO access fee outside of and before the closing of any loan that may be obtained through use of
this system. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system may only waive the CLO access fee based on business considerations
of the operator and not on any action of a lender. If the payment of the CLO access fee is contingent on use of a loan product
on the qualified CLO system, the contingency shall apply equally to all loan products and lenders on the qualified
CLO system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lender Charges for Access.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system may charge lenders for access to the qualified CLO system if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Charges are set forth in a written schedule of charges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Charges for the same services and components of services are the same for all lenders on the system; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The charges are reasonably related to the costs of maintenance and operation of the qualified CLO system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the facilities furnished or the services actually performed). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any payment by a borrower to a CLO operator for services from a nonqualified CLO system, and any payments by a third
party settlement service provider to a CLO operator for access to any CLO system in relation to a federally related
mortgage loan, will be subject to examination under Section 8 of the Act and this part. The disclosure format set forth
in Appendix E of this part and Box 2 of Appendix E of this part shall be utilized by all CLO operators for all CLO systems
and shall be completed before any CLO services are performed.

shall specify the nature of the relationship (explaining the ownership and financial interest) between the provider
of settlement services (or business incident thereto) and the person making the referral, and shall describe the
estimated charge or range of charges (using the same terminology, as far as practical, as Section L of the HUD&hyph;1
or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement) generally made by the provider of settlement services. The disclosure must
be provided on a separate piece of paper at or no earlier than 3 business days before each referral, or, if the lender
requires the use of a particular provider, the time of loan application, except that:

(C) No agent or employee may accept any payment from his or her principal or employer or any other source when that payment
is correlated on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of any referrals of business from
his or her employer or principal to an affiliated entity. For example, no person shall pay any managerial employee
or any employee or agent who is in direct contact with the public a bonus or other compensation correlated on a one-to-one
basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of any referral of settlement service business by the employee
or the employee's organizational unit to an entity affiliated with the employer or principal. In addition, no compensation
of an employee or agent who is routinely in direct contact with the public may be based in whole or in part on the number
or value of referrals that the employee or agent makes to affiliated entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Facts: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A, a mortgage lender, is affiliated with B, a title company, and C, an escrow company, and offers consumers a package
of mortgage title and escrow services at a discount from the prices at which such services would be sold if purchased
separately. Neither A, B, or C, requires consumers to purchase the services of their sister companies, and each company
sells such services separately and as part of the package. A also pays its employees (i.e., loan officers, secretaries,
etc.) a bonus for each loan, title insurance, or closing that A's employees generate for A, B, or C. A pays such employees
bonuses out of its own funds and receives no bonuses or reimbursements for these bonuses from B or C. At or before the
time that customers are told by A or its employees about the services offered by B and C and about the package of services
that is available, the customers are provided with a controlled business arrangement disclosure form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Selling a package of settlement services at a discount is not prohibited by RESPA. Also, A may compensate its own employees
for business generated for A's company, but A may not directly or indirectly compensate A's employees who are routinely
in contact with consumers for business generated for B or C. Nor may B or C directly or indirectly compensate A or A's
employees for business referred to B or C by A's employees. Sections 3500.15(b)(3)(i) (A) and (B) set forth the permissible
exchanges of funds between controlled business entities. No employee or agent may receive compensation correlated
on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of referrals of business to an affiliated entity.
Nothing in the RESPA rule prohibits bonuses or other compensation based, in part, on the generation of business by
A to B and C being paid to managerial employees who are not routinely in contact with consumers.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to exempt 164 generic types of class I devices from the requirement
of premarket notification, with limitations. For the exempted devices, FDA has determined that manufacturers'
submissions of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's
review of such submissions will not advance its public health mission. Granting the exemptions will allow the agency
to make better use of its resources and thus better serve the public.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295,
hereinafter called the amendments) and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA), establishes a comprehensive
system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Section 513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c) establishes
three classes of devices, depending on the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonable assurance of their safety
and effectiveness: Class I, general controls; class II, special controls; and class III, premarket approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 513(d)(2)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(d)(2)(A)) authorizes FDA to exempt, by regulation, a generic type
of class I device from, among other things, the requirement of premarket notification in section 510(k) of the act
(21 U.S.C. 360(k)). Such an exemption permits manufacturers to introduce into commercial distribution generic
types of devices without first submitting a premarket notification to FDA. When FDA issued proposed regulations
classifying preamendments devices, the agency focused on granting exemptions from the requirement of premarket
notification principally when the advisory panels included them in their recommendations to the agency. Subsequently,
FDA decided to exempt certain additional class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification in order
to reduce the number of unnecessary premarket notifications. This action helped to free agency resources for the
review of more complex notifications to FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, FDA exempted 293 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, with
limitations. Some of these devices were exempted from the requirement of premarket notification when the devices
were initially classified into class I. However, the majority of these devices were exempted from the requirement
of premarket notification after being classified into class I. These subsequent exemptions from the requirement
of premarket notification appear in the following

II. Description of Proposed Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering whether to exempt additional class I devices from premarket notification, FDA focused on whether
notification for the type of device is unnecessary for the protection of the public health. For the devices proposed
in this document to be exempted from premarket notification, FDA has concluded that notification is unnecessary
primarily for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The device does not have a significant history of false or misleading claims or of risks associated with inherent
characteristics of the device, such as device design or materials. When making these determinations, FDA generally
has considered the frequency, persistence, cause, or seriousness of such claims or risks, as well as other factors
deemed relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In general, the following factors apply: (a) Characteristics of the device necessary for its safe and effective
performance are well established; (b) anticipated changes in the device that could affect safety and effectiveness
will either: (i) Be readily detectable by users by visual examination or other means, such as routine testing, before
causing harm, e.g., testing of a clinical laboratory reagent with positive and negative controls; or (ii) not materially
increase the risk of injury, incorrect diagnosis, or ineffective treatment; and (c) any changes in the device would
not be likely to result in a change in the device's classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has made the determinations described above based on its knowledge of the device, including past experience and
relevant reports or studies on device performance. If FDA has concerns only about certain types of changes to a particular
class I device, the agency may grant a limited exemption from premarket notification for that generic type of device.
A limited exemption will specify the types of changes to the device for which manufacturers are required to submit
a premarket notification. For example, FDA may exempt a device from the requirement of premarket notification except
when a manufacturer intends to use a different material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises manufacturers that an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification is not an exemption from
any of the other general controls, including current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's), unless explicitly
stated. Indeed, FDA's decision to propose 510(k) exemptions for these devices is based, in part, on the fact that compliance
with CGMP's will help insure product quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's decision to grant an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification for a generic type of class I device
will be based upon the existing and reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices
within that generic type. Because FDA cannot anticipate every change or modification of a class I device exempt from
premarket notification requirements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness, manufacturers
of any commercially distributed class I device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket
notification are still required to submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing a device or delivering
it for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The device is intended for a use different from its intended use before May 28, 1976, or the device is intended for
a use different from the intended use of the preamendments device to which it has been determined to be substantially
equivalent; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use instead
of use by health care professionals; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than used by the device before
May 28, 1976; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or
an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe
or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such changes or modifications to class I devices that are exempt from premarket notification would mean the exemption
would no longer apply. Changes or modifications to devices that are not exempt from premarket notification requirements
under any regulation must undergo a more comprehensive assessment to determine the impact of the change or modification
on the device's safety and effectiveness. FDA intends to develop guidance clarifying when a change or modification
to a device requires submission of a premarket notification as defined in 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the dates listed, FDA published final regulations classifying, among others, the devices listed below. When FDA
classified these devices, the agency did not propose exempting them from the requirement of premarket notification.
Based on the analysis described above, FDA has now determined that premarket notification with respect to the devices
listed below is unnecessary for the protection of the public health and will not advance FDA's public health mission.
This approach is consistent with the recommendation in the May 1993 report of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, entitled ``Less Than the Sum of its Parts Reforms
Needed in the Organization, Management, and Resources of The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and
Radiological Health.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earlier this year, the Office of Device Evaluation undertook a risk assessment of all devices in order to ensure the
proper allocation of resources in the review process. All of the class I devices listed below were placed in Tier I,
the category of devices which have a minimal inherent risk and whose review focuses upon intended use. A number of class
II devices were also included in the Tier I evaluation process. FDA intends to consider proposing exemptions from
the requirement of premarket notification for these devices. In the near future, FDA believes that exempting these
devices from premarket notification will allow the agency to better use its available resources to protect the public
health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to exempt from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations, the 164 generic type
of class I devices listed in Table 2 below:

FDA is proposing to grant exemption from the requirement of premarket notification for each of the devices in Table
14 above. The proposed exemption for the keratoscope (&sect;886.1350) and for the corneal radius measuring device
(&sect;886.1450) is limited and does not include topographers. Additionally, the proposed exemption for the ophthalmic
chair (&sect;886.1140), keratoscope (&sect;886.1350), pupillometer (&sect;886.1700), tangent screen (&sect;886.1810),
ophthalmic instrument stand (&sect;886.1860), stereoscope (&sect;886.1870), spectacle dissociation test system
(&sect;886.1910), ophthalmic instrument table (&sect;886.4855), and optical vision aid (&sect;886.5915) would
apply to alternating current (AC)-powered devices. The proposed exemption for nonprescription sunglasses (&sect;886.5850)
is limited and applies only to sunglasses which: (1) Transmit less than 1.0 percent UV&hyph;B radiation, (2) transmit
less than 5.0 percent UV&hyph;A radiation, (3) meet impact resistance (21 CFR 801.410), (4) are made with nonflammable
materials, and (5) limit claims to reduction of the risk of age-related cataracts, and/or photokeratitis. The proposed
exemption for the euthyscope (&sect;886.1250), transilluminator (&sect;886.1945) and ophthalmic electrolysis
unit (&sect;886.4250) is limited and would apply only to battery-powered devices (AC-powered devices are class
II devices).

III. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.249(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Analysis of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a proposal on small entities. Because this proposal would reduce a regulatory burden by exempting manufacturers
of devices subject to the rule from the requirements of premarket notification, the agency certifies that the proposed
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

The Bureau of the Census proposes to replace the Plant and Equipment Expenditures Survey (P&amp;E) with a new economic
indicator survey called the Investment Plans Survey (IPS) which will have close connection to the Annual Capital
Expenditures Survey (ACES) (OMB approval number 0607&hyph;0782). The reasons for replacing the P&amp;E are: 1)
to improve the quality of the economic indicator of investment plans, 2) to improve consistency and definition of
investment data, and 3) to simplify respondent reporting. The IPS will provide an early estimate of investment in
structures and equipment for the year ending and an indicator of planned investment for the upcoming year. The Federal
Reserve Board, the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis are among the principal data
users. We plan to replace the P&amp;E with this new survey beginning in November 1994. At that time we will collect actual
expenditure data for 1994 and planned spending for 1995.

The Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 require state and local governments and institutions
of higher education and other non&hyph;profit institutions receiving $100,000 or more in Federal financial aid
to have an annual audit of their financial operations. OMB has designated the Census Bureau as the central clearinghouse
for these audits. We use the Single Audit Questionnaires to contact those entities that have not sent in their audit
reports to request that they forward the report or clarify their reporting status. Information on the reporting status
of non&hyph;profit institutions was collected on a one&hyph;time basis during FY 1991. This activity was not funded
during Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 but will be reinstituted for 1994.

The petitions were submitted pursuant to Section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong. This merchandise
is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 3920.00.00, 3921.00.00, 3926.90.00,
4819.50.00, 4820.50.00, 4820.90.00, and 4823.90.00. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes.
The written description remains dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic
interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under &sect;353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on photo albums
and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are
revoking this antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d)(4)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993. Entries made during the period December
1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.22(e).
The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993, without regard to
antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This
notice is in accordance with 19 CFR &sect;353.25(d).

By letter to the Commission dated July 11, 1994, the Managed Futures Association (``MFA'') requested a thirty-three-day
extension of the comment period to August 17, 1994. The MFA indicated that it had been meeting with its members frequently

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Navy has explored ways to comply with restrictions on the discharge into the ocean of solid waste
generated aboard its ships. The basis for the restrictions, the Navy's efforts to comply and its strategy for achieving
future compliance are set out below.

Restrictions on Discharge of Solid Waste at Sea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States is a party to the International Convention on Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, S. Treaty
Doc. No. 3, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987). The 1973 Convention was amended by the MARPOL Protocol in 1978, 17 I.L.M.
546 (1978), and the combination is frequently referred to as MARPOL 73/78. MARPOL 73/78 protects the ocean environment
by prohibiting some discharges altogether, restricting other discharges to particular distances from land, and
establishing ``special areas'' within which additional discharge limitations apply. MARPOL 73/78 deals with particular
types of discharges in five annexes. Annex V addresses discharge of garbage from ships. MARPOL 73/78 was implemented
for the United States in the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), 33 U.S.C. 1901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Annex V has been implemented for the U.S. by the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA), Pub. L.
No. 100&hyph;220, 101 Stat. 1460 (1987),

, and section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat.
1745 (DAA&hyph;94). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MARPOL 73/78 provides enhanced protection to particular bodies of water, designated ``special areas,'' because
their oceanographic characteristics and ecological significance requires protective measures more strict than
other areas of the ocean. The stricter requirements become applicable once the International Maritime Organization
declares that the special areas are ``in effect'' after determining that the littoral countries have sufficient
capacity to handle wastes from ships.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The international community has long recognized that the characteristics of warships pose special problems for
strict compliance with MARPOL 73/78, which reasonably focuses on civilian vessels which are far more prevalent than
warships on the world's oceans. Article 3 of MARPOL 73/78 recognizes the special nature of warships by exempting them
from strict compliance with the provisions of the Convention. It provides that the Convention:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[S]hall not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship *&blank;*&blank;*. Each Party shall ensure by the
adoption of measures not impairing the operational capabilities of such ships *&blank;*&blank;* that such ships
act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For U.S. public vessels, implementation of MARPOL 73/78 generally preserves the sovereign immunity of warships
and public vessels, excluding them from strict application of the standards but requiring the Secretary of Defense
to prescribe regulations ensuring ``so far as is reasonable and practicable without impairing the operations or
operational capabilities'' of the ships that they act ``in a manner consistent with the MARPOL Protocol.''

, the Navy has prescribed discharge limits and operational practices for Navy ships that are at least as protective
as those required under MARPOL 73/78 under most circumstances. Under the MPPRCA, however, Navy ships were required
to come into full compliance with the requirements of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Under the MPPRCA, the Navy was to come
into full compliance with Annex V to MARPOL 73/78 by January 1, 1994 or to notify Congress if it was unable to comply.

Navy Compliance Efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the early 1980's, the Navy has been developing technological means to eliminate or mitigate discharge of solid
waste from its ships. Through a combination of material substitution, source reduction and management practices,
for example, the discharge of plastic waste was cut by over 70 percent. The Navy also pursued development of other technology
to help manage solid waste at sea. By 1993, the Navy had installed equipment and imposed procedures to fully comply
with MARPOL restrictions on non-plastic waste everywhere but in special areas, and had achieved an estimated 70 percent
compliance with restrictions on plastic waste. In addition, the Navy developed new technology that, when finally
procured and installed, will allow Navy surface ships to come into full compliance with restrictions on discharge
of plastic waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with the technical studies, the Navy engaged numerous stakeholders in a dialogue in which the Keystone
Center acted as a facilitator. The stakeholders included Federal and state agencies, Congressional staff, and environmental
groups. The dialogue allowed the Navy to provide information to the participants about the special problems it faces
in continuing military operations on the world's oceans while still complying with restrictions on the discharge
of solid waste. The Navy was also better able to understand the concerns and interests of the representative stakeholders
on the subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy reported its efforts at managing shipboard solid waste in ``U.S. Navy Compliance with the Marine Plastic
Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987'' (June 1993). Congress responded by extending the original deadlines
in the MPPRCA. As required by section 1003(a) of the DAA&hyph;94, surface ships must eliminate all discharges of plastics
by December 31, 1998 and must comply with limits on discharges of other solid waste in special areas that are ``in effect''
by December 31, 2000. Submarines must comply with both requirements by December 31, 2008.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navy has identified the solution to the problem of plastic discharges from surface ships and is working hard on
a solution for submarines. Strict compliance with all requirements for discharges of nonplastic solid waste in special
areas, however, presents a larger problem because of the nature of the waste stream and the military mission of warships.
Regulation 5 of Annex V pertains to discharges in special areas and prohibits discharges of solid wastes, other than
food wastes. Although the Navy has made important strides in studying the shipboard waste stream, in developing management
strategies, and in developing equipment that can mitigate the effects of solid waste discharges, the Navy has not
identified a final solution that would eliminate all non-food discharges in special areas. Recognizing the difficulty
in achieving strict compliance with all requirements of Annex V, in section 1003(b) of the DAA&hyph;94, Congress
required the Navy to prepare a plan for compliance with the requirements of Regulation 5 under Annex V. The special
area compliance plan must be submitted to Congress by November 30, 1996. If the special area compliance plan demonstrates
that full compliance with all the requirements of Regulation 5 of Annex V is not technologically feasible in the case
of certain ships under certain conditions, it must include the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The ships for which full compliance is not technologically feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the technical and operational impediments to achieving such compliance as rapidly as is technologically feasible;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. such other information as the Secretary of the Navy considers relevant and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with DAA&hyph;94 and to ensure the broad public understanding of the problem, the Navy will consult
with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency as it prepares the special area compliance plan. The Navy will also provide the
opportunity for public participation in preparation of the special area compliance plan, including public review
and comment. This notice is provided to inform the public that preparation of the special area compliance plan is beginning
and to solicit public comments on the scope of the studies to be planned and the alternatives to be studied.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any solution to the Navy's solid waste problem in special areas must consider the types of missions that the Navy is
directed to carry out in special areas and the constraints and challenges inherent in operating warships at sea. These
considerations include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy must be prepared to carry out duties assigned by the President to protect the nation's interests around the
world. Most of the designated special areas include locations of great strategic and economic interest, including
the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and the Baltic. Navy missions
in such areas often require that ships remain on station at sea for prolonged periods of time. For example, surveillance
and tracking missions for drug interdiction or for enforcement of economic sanctions would be compromised if ships
were required to leave station and steam to port to offload waste. For another example, Naval ships maintaining combat
air patrol over a crisis area like Bosnia often must remain on station at sea for months at a time to prevent a break in
coverage. Navy ships have also often been ordered to remain for weeks or months off the coast of nations in turmoil so
that U.S. forces can evacuate U.S. citizens if necessary. In other circumstances, Navy ships may be required to remain
offshore to provide access to sophisticated medical care in case of injury or wounding of peacekeeping troops. Some
Navy ships, especially submarines, necessarily must operate without underway logistic support from other Navy
ships. Thus, the special area compliance plan must consider any impacts that it may impose on mission effectiveness
and operational flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The special area compliance plan must be compatible with warship design. Navy ships are designed to maximize their
ability to perform their missions, especially combat missions. Ships are self-contained units with severe limits
on space, weight and power requirements for their equipment. While naval architecture and ship design always require
compromise among competing priorities, Navy ships must be equipped, manned and constructed to function effectively
and survive in far more rigorous circumstances than commercial ships. Navy ships must devote considerable space
and weight to specialized combat systems equipment and damage control features. They have far larger crews than commercial
vessels because more systems must be operated, and most routine equipment maintenance must be done by the ship's crew
at sea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many classes of Navy ships are already classified as ``space and weight critical,'' which means that any equipment
added to the ship (for example, to manage solid waste) must be compensated for by removing other equipment already
devoted to some other portion of the ship's mission. Many ships also have only modest additional power available to
drive additional equipment and would have to turn off other important systems to use a waste control system with high
power requirements. Thus the Navy's special area compliance plan must carefully address the size, weight and power
requirements of any additional equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The crew size on Navy ships, an important factor in determining the size of the waste stream, varies tremendously.
Submarines have crews of approximately 120. Cruisers have crews of approximately 380. Large amphibious ships have
crews of approximately 2000. Aircraft carriers have crews approaching 6000. The Navy's special area compliance
plan must address solutions that can be adapted successfully to several different capacities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because they operate independently in a dynamic, often physically hostile marine environment, Navy ships and the
equipment on them must be designed to withstand stresses and operating conditions not encountered on shore. The Navy
has experienced difficulty with some ``off the shelf'' equipment not specifically designed for shipboard use. Shipboard
equipment must also be reliable, maintainable by Navy crews, and capable of being logistically supported by the Navy
supply system. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address reliability and maintainability of any new equipment
in a marine environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy faces a fiscal environment where many meritorious programs must compete for a declining total amount of resources,
in terms of both funding and personnel. Development, acquisition, installation and operation of new equipment,
therefore, must be cost efficient. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address the resources needed to implement
it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above, to be feasible for use by the Navy for vessels throughout the fleet, equipment or strategies
to implement an alternative must balance operational, design, cost, and environmental considerations in the same
manner that equipment designed for propulsion, communications, weapons or other shipboard functions are evaluated.
The criteria normally considered by the Navy for shipboard systems include those set out in the Appendix to this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives To Be Studied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the special area compliance plan, the Navy proposes to analyze three different categories of alternatives.
The first two categories would ensure full compliance with Regulation 5 under Annex V. The third alternative would
not ensure full compliance with Regulation 5 under Annex V, but may preserve many or all of the environmental values
protected by Regulation 5 in the event that full compliance is not feasible. The Navy remains committed to full compliance,
but is taking this opportunity to increase the information available on ways to mitigate discharges in special areas.
The Navy will also analyze combinations of the technologies from the distinct alternatives. The general categories
of alternatives are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
On Board Destruction of Waste Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This category of alternatives focuses on technologies that result in virtually complete destruction of waste aboard
the vessel. These might include incineration or more technologically advanced thermal destruction. Study of these
technologies would include study of the proper handling of any residue as well any safety concerns and cross media
pollution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Store and Retrograde Waste Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second category of alternatives focuses on technologies that permit storage and retrograde of waste, either
on board the generating ship or by service force ships. These would include study of refrigeration, compaction, odor
barrier bags and other means to facilitate storage and retrograde of waste for disposal on shore. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Process Solid Waste Until It Is ``Environmentally Benign'' and Discharge Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third category of alternatives focuses on technologies that are designed to process waste to produce an effluent
that is environmentally benign if discharged to the sea. The study of this alternative would also include fate and
effect studies of the discharge and the relative effect of such discharges in comparison to other discharges from
land or sea sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Navy solicits public input to the special area compliance plan. Among other topics, public comments could address
the scope of the alternatives to be considered, the studies considered necessary, the measures of merit by which to
evaluate the alternatives, and suggested technologies or strategies for compliance. As described above, the Navy
will hold a public meeting to obtain and consider public comments on the Navy's compliance with the MARPOL requirements.
Members of the public are invited to attend.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the public meeting the Navy will analyze the alternatives (including combinations of the alternatives),
conduct required research and prepare a draft special area compliance plan. Comments should be submitted in writing
to the Officer in Charge, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Annapolis Detachment, 3A Leggett Circle,
Annapolis, MD 21402&hyph;6067 (Attn: Code 634A) in time to be received not later than 30 days after the date of the public
meeting. The Navy expects to formally consult with the other concerned agencies on the draft special area compliance
plan in late 1995 and to make the draft special area compliance plan available for public comment in Spring, 1996. After
public review and comment, the Navy will submit the plan to Congress.

activities as well as evaluate and disseminate project outcomes.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy announced that pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to provide additional
funding and extend the budget period for Grant No. DE&hyph;FG02&hyph;91CE23810 based on an unsolicited application
received from Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute (ARTI) for Phase IV of the project, Materials
Compatibility and Lubricant Research to Accelerate Introduction of CFC_Refrigerant Substitutes. The determination
to extend this grant is based on the following information: A technical evaluation of the proposed project was performed
pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and (e). The proposed project assists DOE in carrying out its mission of seeking alternative
refrigerants for Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in refrigeration and insulation
in an effort to reduce the deleterious effects of refrigeration chemicals on stratospheric ozone. ARTI has made available
substantial and unique facilities and resources not available elsewhere. This includes considerable amounts of
information that are proprietary to the member industries participating in the project. It is determined that the
proposed project is meritorious in significantly improving the information data base upon which new refrigerants
and lubricants can be selected, and refrigeration equipment can be designed to utilize these chemical compounds.
The probability of success is extremely high due to the high level of industry participation and commitment to the
effort, particularly cost sharing or in-kind support. The key personnel assigned to the project have capabilities
critical to the accelerated development of alternative refrigerants and the refrigeration equipment required
to effectively utilize these new chemical compounds. DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning
to conduct such an effort. This effort is not considered suitable for competitive financial assistance. The DOE share
of funding is estimated at $3,190,000 and ARTI's cost share is estimated at $226,493 for a two-year budget period estimated
to be from September 30, 1994 through September 30, 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of the project is continue tests to evaluate the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) pilot plant developed
under Cooperative Agreement DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;88ID12711. The pilot plant configuration was developed to treat
corrosive wastes and waste with high solids content. DOE has no recent, current, or planned solicitations under which
this proposal would be eligible. The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory continuation of an activity
funded by DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion
of the project. DOE and commercial implementation of SCWO technology will reduce the volume of hazardous and mixed
waste currently stored and generated in the United States. SCWO technology is recognized as a high potential alternative
technology to incineration, providing cleaner effluents and with less institutional barriers than incineration.
The award will be for one year at a total estimated cost of $700,000. Cost share is anticipated to be 10% of the project
costs. Statutory authority for this award is Pub. L. 93&hyph;577, Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development
Act of 1974. The Federal Domestic Catalog Number is 81.103.

the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed project would include the following features: (1) an existing dam 372 feet long and 18 feet high; (2) an
existing impoundment with a surface area of 90 acres with a normal surface elevation of approximately 990 feet above
mean sea level; (3) an existing powerhouse containing two new turbine-generator units at a total installed capacity
of 1,260 kilowatts; and (4) a proposed 13.8-kilovolt transmission line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the proposed two new turbine-generator units, the Applicant proposes install a new flat trashrack
(with 2.75&hyph;3.5-inch clear bar spacing) above the project intake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To enhance public recreation, the Applicant proposes to develop a new boat ramp at the Fort Dodge Park, located adjacent
to proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes measures relating to project operation to protect environmental resources in the project
area. A 24-cubic feet per second minimum flow over the project dam is proposed to protect water quality and fishery
resources in the downstream pool area and side channel. The project would be operated in a run-of-river mode, with
only minor fluctuations in the headpond elevation to account for natural variations in river flow. In the operational
plan for the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project, the Applicant also proposes to implement a plan to verify run-of-river operation
and a seasonal water quality monitoring program for the impoundment.

Project Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission staff will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant.
The staff will review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement
measures that may be appropriate to include in an original license. Modifications could include recommendations
by the agencies, the general public, and the staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these alternatives, the staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing
environment or status quo at the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope of the Environmental Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed actions' effects on the
resources. Since the proposed actions affect each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource
varies. For fishery resources, flow analysis, water quality, flood control, and power, the geographic scope of analysis
will encompass the mainstem Des Moines River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on the resources.
Based on the license term, the temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on
the resource from reasonably foreseeable future actions (e.g., the effect on water quality from potential future
water withdrawals within the basin). The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available
information for each resource.

Environmental Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A preliminary list of environmental issues identified by the staff for coverage in an Environmental Assessment (EA)
is presented in this section. The list is not intended to be exhaustive or final, but is an initial listing of issues
that have been raised and appear to be important. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process
and make decisions as to the level of analysis needed. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented
in this scoping document have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following issues apply to the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An evaluation of the project's potential effect on dissolved oxygen (DO) downstream of the project and the
need for additional studies of DO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Effects of project operation and non-project factors on vegetation and wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Effects of project operation on any federally listed threatened or endangered species in the project area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Probability of eligibility of dam and powerhouse on the National Register of Historic Places. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Opportunities for recreational facility improvements and public access enhancements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will assess the project-specific impacts on the above resources and whether these impacts contribute to significant
adverse impacts. Both project-specific impacts and cumulative effects will weigh in selecting an action to recommend
for the licensing decision on the project.

July 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 10, 1994, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) issued a notice indicating that staff
is ready to conduct an environmental analysis (REA Notice) for the proposed Holliday Hydroelectric Plant, located
on the West Fork of the White River in Noblesville Township, Hamilton County, Indiana. The REA Notice also requested
comments from Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, and any other interested groups
(the parties). Parties were given until March 10, 1994, to file comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this notice is to advise all parties as to the proposed scope of the staff's environmental analysis and
to seek additional information pertinent to this analysis. The proposed scope of analysis as presented herein is
based on the information filed with the Commission by Holliday Historic Restoration Associates, Ltd. (the Applicant),
comments received from the parties thus far, and the staff's independent analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant proposes to rehabilitate a retired hydroelectric facility owned by Public Service Company of Indiana,
Inc. (PSI). The facility is located on the West Fork of the White River, a tributary of the Wabash River, in central Indiana,
and used as a source of cooling water for an adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant owned and operated
by PSI. (From 1950 to 1965, the hydroelectric facility, then known as the unlicensed Noblesville Project, was operated
by PSI to provide energy for use at PSI's adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant.) The Applicant intends
to use revenues from the rehabilitated project to restore the historic powerhouse and open it to the public for historic
tours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed project would include the following features: (1) an existing concrete dam, 350 feet long and 10 feet
high; (2) an existing 11-acre impoundment, with a normal water surface elevation of 764 feet mean sea level; and (3)
an existing 25-foot by 50-foot powerhouse that would contain two new turbine-generator units having a total generating
capacity of 450 kilowatts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the proposed two new turbine-generator units, the Applicant proposes to renovate an existing upstream
fish passage facility (concrete flume) and install two new angled trashracks (with 3/4-inch clear bar spacing) above
the project intakes, and provide a downstream fish passage facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To enhance public recreation, the Applicant proposes to develop a new parking area and picnic facilities on the west
bank upstream from the dam, as well as a footbridge across the PSI inlet area, connecting to an existing canoe portage
around the dam. Other improvements to the area would include the construction of safety fencing and other safety measures.
As indicated earlier, historical tours of the powerhouse would be conducted on weekends for the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes measures relating to project operation to protect and enhance environmental resources in
the project area. A 40-cubic feet per second (cfs) minimum flow over the project dam is proposed to protect water quality
and fishery resources in the downstream pool area and side channel. The project would be operated in a run-of-river
mode, with only minor fluctuations in the headpond elevation to account for natural variations in river flow. In the
operational plan for the Holliday Project, the Applicant also proposes to implement a plan to verify run-of-river
operation and a seasonal water quality monitoring program for the impoundment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Project Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant. The staff will
review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement measures
that may be appropriate to include in an original minor license. Modifications could include recommendations by
the agencies, the general public, and the staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these alternatives, the staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing
environment or status quo at the facility. Under this alternative the project impoundment would continue to provide
cooling water for the adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant, as at present. We use this alternative
to set baseline environmental conditions for comparison with other alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Environmental Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed action's effects on the
resources. Since the proposed action affects each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource
varies. We have identified no affects of operating the Holliday Project that, when coupled with other activities
on the West Fork of the White River, would affect environmental resources in a cumulative manner. Therefore, for water
quality, fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, recreation, and all other resources we will focus our
analysis on the project area and the West Fork of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
White River, unless persuaded by comments during the scoping process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on water quality,
fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, recreation, and other resources. Based on the license term, the
temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on the resource from reasonably
foreseeable future actions. The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available
information for each resource.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A preliminary list of environmental issues identified by the staff for coverage in an Environmental Assessment (EA)
is presented in this section. The list is not intended to be exhaustive or final, but is an initial listing of issues
that have been raised and appear to be important. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process
and make decisions as to the level of analysis needed. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented
in this scoping document have little potential for causing significant adverse effects, the issue or issues will
be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following issues apply to the Holliday Project: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;effects of the proposed mode of operation on dissolved oxygen and water temperature in the project impoundment
and downstream river reach; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;effects of flow-pattern changes from operating the proposed project, and minimum flow needs for the protection
of fishery resources and water quality in the pool area and side channel immediately downstream of the project dam;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;project effects of entrainment and turbine-induced mortality on resident fishes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;fish passage needs at the project dam; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;effects on the historical value of the project dam and powerhouse, both determined eligible for inclusion

Take notice that on June 30, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), P.O. Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in
Docket No. CP94&hyph;635&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon the delivery point known as the Anaconda
Copper Company Meter Station located in Cibola County, New Mexico under El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket
No. CP82&hyph;435&hyph;000 and CP88&hyph;433&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso proposes to remove one 2'' O.D. tap and valve assembly, with appurtenances, and one 4'' O.D. positive displacement
meter at approximately milepost 343.41 on El Paso's Permian-San Juan Crossover Line in the NW/4 of Section 18, Township
12 North, Range 10 West, Cibola County, New Mexico. The metering facility will be removed with only minimal ground
disturbance with that being limited to existing, previously-disturbed right-of-way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that it provides firm transportation service for Gas Company of New Mexico (GCNM) at the Anaconda Copper
Company Meter Station pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Transportation Service Agreement dated November
12, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso understands that Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), successor to Anaconda Copper Company has closed an operating
site and terminated its June 19, 1974 gas purchase contract with GCNM. This gas purchase contract covered gas service
to ARCO's Bluewater Millsite in Cibola County, New Mexico. El Paso understands further that as part of ARCO's termination
request, ARCO also requested that the segment of GCNM's line feeding the Bluewater Millsite be disconnected at El
Paso's metering station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso asserts that as a direct result of the Bluewater Millsite closing, and since GCNM has not requested gas service
from this meter station since May 1989, GCNM has requested that El Paso abandon and remove the Anaconda Copper Company
Meter Station. This meter station serves no purpose and may obstruct ARCO's clean up of the Bluewater Millsite. Accordingly,
El Paso proposes to abandon by removal the Anaconda Copper Company Meter Station.

Natural Gas Corporation (Cascade) at the Shelton, Washington delivery point. Applicant proposes the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. construct and operate a new compressor station to consist of one Solar Saturn T&hyph;1300 compressor unit, rated
at 1,343 horsepower at MP 7.85 on the Shelton Lateral. At a cost of $6,996,700; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. upgrade the Shelton Meter Station at the terminus of the Shelton Lateral by installing 6-inch turbine meters, a
1,500,000 Btu per hour line heater, 6-inch filter, 4-inch bypass electronic flow measurement, and a 16-foot by 14-foot
building. At a cost of $410,700; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. partially abandon facilities at the Shelton Meter Station, which will be replaced with the new upgraded facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant states that these facilities will increase its capacity to Cascade on the Shelton Lateral by 21,000 MMBtu/d
and allow increased delivery pressures to Cascade. The maximum daily design capacity of the upgraded Shelton Meter
Station will increase from 12,000 MMBtu/d to 44,270 MMBtu/d. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firm transportation service through the proposed facilities will be subject to Applicant's Rate Schedules TF&hyph;1
and TF&hyph;2 in Applicant's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1. The expanded capacity at the Shelton delivery
point will also be available under interruptible transportation agreements under Applicant's TI&hyph;1 Rate Schedule.
Pursuant to a facilities Agreement and the facilities reimbursement provisions of Applicant's tariff, Cascade
will reimburse Applicant for all costs connected with the proposed facilities in a monthly Facility Cost-of-Service
Charge. Initially this charge will be $165,265.

1994, pursuant to Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for permission and approval to abandon certain
facilities in Erie County, Pennsylvania, and to replace the abandoned facilities with a new metering and regulating
station, and construct and operate approximately 4,395 feet of twelve-inch pipeline and appurtenant facilities
connecting the new station to its existing facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National states that it proposes to replace an existing metering and regulating station and add a new dehydration
facility at National's Summit Storage Field located in Summit Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania. National indicates

beginning at an existing valve on National's Line S&hyph;52 and ending at National's Line S&hyph;57. National further
states it will also be required to construct and operate approximately 400 feet of eight-inch inlet and outlet piping
to connect the new station to this new pipeline. National estimates the cost of the project at $760,000. National indicates
that construction of the facilities will be financed with internally generated funds and/or interim short-term
bank loans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed discharges of dredged or fill material in fresh, estuarine, and saline (near-coastal) waters, or ``waters
of the United States,'' must be evaluated to determine the potential environmental impacts of such activities. Specifically,
Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, Public Law 92&hyph;500, as amended by the Clean Water
Act (CWA), Public Law 95&hyph;217, requires that the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
be permitted by the Corps of Engineers (CE). EPA has the primary role in developing the environmental guidelines_the
section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines)_in conjunction with CE, by which permit applications must be evaluated.
The Guidelines are published at 40 CFR part 230. Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that dredged or fill material
should not be discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated that such a discharge will not have
an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or probable impacts of other
activities affecting the ecosystems of concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dredged material testing is part of the larger evaluation of a proposed discharge activity to determine its compliance
with the Guidelines. Sections 230.60 and 230.61 of the Guidelines provide the basis for certain contaminant-related
factual determinations regarding the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge. The present draft
testing manual, ``Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft),''
details the physical, chemical, and biological evaluation procedures outlined in &sect;&sect;230.60 and 230.61.
The manual includes technical guidance on sampling and analysis, physical and chemical evaluations, bioassays
(toxicity and bioaccumulation), quality assurance/quality control, evaluation of discharges from confined disposal
facilities, evaluation of mixing, statistical methods, and identification of ammonia toxicity. It uses a tiered
testing approach which is scientifically valid and cost-effective. Conclusions reached utilizing this manual
will be used to make factual determinations of the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge of dredged
material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This manual will replace the May 1976 testing protocol, ``Ecological Evaluation of Proposed Discharge of Dredged
or Fill Material into Navigable Waters,'' which will no longer be applicable. Since development of the 1976 guidance,
EPA and CE have gained a great deal of experience in testing dredged material for environmental effects. Much of this
experience has been used in the development of a 1991 ``ocean'' testing manual to implement requirements in the Marine
Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act for evaluation of potential environmental impacts associated with the
discharge of dredged material in waters seaward of the baseline of the territorial sea. Further technical improvements,
such as the refinement of bioassay tests, have been incorporated in the present draft testing manual, ``Evaluation
of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft),'' which implements dredged
material testing requirements under the CWA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final testing manual will be published in approximately 6 months after review and consideration of the comments
received on this draft.

State Grants to Support Development of Nutrition Intervention Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
grants to support the development of State and community nutrition intervention programs. This announcement addresses
two distinct components:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
I. ``Nutrition Intervention Assistance'' for supporting the implementation of nutrition interventions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. ``5 A Day Evaluation'' for supporting the evaluation of 5 A Day for Better Health nutrition intervention programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants may apply for either the Nutrition Intervention Assistance component or the 5 A Day Evaluation component
or both components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related specifically to the priority area of nutrition and, generally, to several other
priority areas of health promotion and preventive services_including physical activity and fitness, heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section, ``Where to Obtain Additional
Information.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is authorized under sections 301(a), [42 U.S.C. 241 (a)] and 317(k)(2), [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)] of the
Public Health Service Act, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Smoke-Free Workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Nutrition Intervention Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assistance will be provided only to the health departments of States or their bona fide agents. This includes the District
of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and federally recognized
Indian tribal governments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligible applicants for nutrition intervention program grants have been restricted to official health departments
of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The methodology to conduct this program has been structured to support the national goals and objectives of ``Healthy
People 2000.'' In many instances, State health departments have already embraced or established their own goals
and objectives which match or are synonymous with those outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The conduct of Statewide health promotion, health education, and risk reduction programs directed towards reducing
the prevalence of behavioral risks in the population lie solely with State Health Departments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Program evaluation is expected to be useful to State Health Departments in program and intervention development.
Because comparable methods are used from State to State and from year to year, States can compare data and intervention
methods with other States and monitor the effects of interventions over time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible applicants are restricted to official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities
for the reasons listed in (A) above. Eligibility for this component is further restricted to States who have established,
clearly defined, evaluable, long range 5 A Day for Better Health projects in a specific community channel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $740,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 29 awards. Awards may be made for the Nutrition
Intervention Assistance, or 5 A Day Evaluation or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Nutrition Intervention Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $450,000 is available to fund approximately 25 awards. It is expected that the average award will be
$18,000, ranging from $10,000 to $30,000. States are encouraged to use these funds to expand the community involvement
toward the goals of this program.

B. 5 A Day Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $290,000 is available to fund approximately 4 awards. It is expected that the average award will be
$75,000, ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Awards will be considered only for applicants who have an established,
clearly defined, and evaluable long range 5 A Day for Better Health project in a specific community channel (e.g.,
supermarkets, schools, churches, food assistance programs, worksites, health clinics, media, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that the awards will begin on or about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of one year. Funding estimates
may vary and are subject to change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Awards under this announcement will not be sufficient to fully support an applicant's proposed activities, but are
meant to be used in conjunction with other resources_whether direct funding or in-kind contributions_that the applicant
may have available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The awards will support State efforts to develop and evaluate nutrition intervention programs. Emphasis will be
placed on supporting activities of partnerships to carry out interventions and/or evaluations designed to increase
the consumption of fruits and vegetables, to decrease fat intake, and/or to increase physical activity while improving
diet.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Aceon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (perindopril erbumine) is indicated for the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. Subsequent to this
approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Aceon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. 4,508,729) from Adir, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining
this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated May 10, 1994, advised the Patent and
Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval for Aceon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Aceon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is 2,284 days. Of this time, 1,367 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 917
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: October 1, 1987. The applicant claims October 23, 1987, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was October 1, 1987, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: June 28, 1991. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that June 28, 1991, was the date the new drug application (NDA)
for Aceon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NDA 20&hyph;184) was initially submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: December 30, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20&hyph;184 was approved on December 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,588 days of patent extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before September 19, 1994, submit to
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any
interested person may petition FDA, on or before January 17, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant
for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. Re. 30,633) from A. Christians Societe Anonyme, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated December
9, 1993, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Demadex

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Demadex
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is 2,790 days. Of this time, 1,882 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 908
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: January 4, 1986. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that January 4, 1986, was the date the investigational new
drug application (IND) became effective. The applicant claims January 10, 1986, as the date the IND became effective.
However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was January 4, 1986, which was 30 days after FDA receipt of
the IND.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: February 28, 1991. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that February 28, 1991, was the date the new drug application
(NDA) for Demadex
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NDA 20&hyph;136) was initially submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: August 23, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20&hyph;136 was approved on August 23, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 5 years of patent term
extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before September 19, 1994, submit to
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any
interested person may petition FDA, on or before January 17, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant
for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading

Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI&hyph;35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A&hyph;16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA is proposing to revise the system notices for the ``Carrier Medicare Claims Records'' (CMCR), System No. 09&hyph;70&hyph;0501,
and the ``Intermediary Medicare Claims Records'' (IMCR), System No. 09&hyph;70&hyph;0503. The Privacy Act permits
disclosure of information without the prior written consent of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure
for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data is collected. HCFA is proposing to revise the CMCR and IMCR
by adding a new routine use for release of intermediary and carrier maintained beneficiary data to servicing Medicare
banks and/or provider banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this new routine use is to allow fiscal intermediaries (FIs) and carriers to send claims payment and
beneficiary information to providers or their banks either directly, or through a Value Added Network (VAN) telecommunications
service and for provider banks to use this information to perform account management activities on behalf of providers.
Under this scenario, the electronic funds transfer (EFT) and the electronic remittance advice (ERA) flow together
through the banking system. The consolidation of Medicare beneficiary and payment information will reduce paperwork
and administrative costs.

time in which to comment, the altered systems of records, including routine uses, will become effective 40 days from
the publication of this notice or from the date submitted to OMB and the Congress, whichever is later, unless HCFA receives
comments which require alterations to this notice. The proposed new routine use shall take effect without further
notice 40 days from the date of publication unless comments received on or before that date would warrant changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The IMCR and the CMCR exist to assure proper health insurance benefit payments to or on behalf of entitled Medicare
Part A and Part B beneficiaries. The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information without the prior written consent
of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data
is collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IMCR and CMCR systems of records were last published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 55 FR 37549; September 12, 1990. Currently, there are 23 routine uses in the IMCR system and 25 in the CMCR system that
permit disclosure of information to individuals and/or organizations for a variety of reasons, the majority of which
relate to the timely and accurate processing of Medicare claims, payment safeguards activities, and research. There
are safeguards in place, as described in the safeguard section of both systems, to protect the data which have been
developed in accordance with part 6 of the HHS Information Resource Management Manual and the National Institute
of Standards and Technology Information Process Standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are proposing to add a new routine use (number (24)/(26)) to the Carrier and Intermediary systems of records, for
the release of data without an individuals' prior written consent. The new routine use would permit the release of
beneficiary data via ERA to servicing Medicare banks and to provider banks. Servicing Medicare banks enter into agreements
with the Health Care Financing Administration and with contracted Medicare claims processors to provide check clearing,
account maintenance and electronic payment origination services for the Medicare program. The proposed routine
use allows release of data from the IMCR and the CMCR to servicing Medicare banks and/or Medicare provider banks for
one or more of the following purposes: (1) For servicing Medicare banks to transmit ERAs on behalf of Medicare contractors
to Medicare providers directly or through the banking system to either the provider's bank or a VAN; (2) For provider
banks to receive ERAs from the servicing Medicare banks and to transmit the remittance information directly to Medicare
providers via mail, telefax, or electronic transmission; (3) For provider banks to receive ERAs from the originating
Medicare banks in order to perform account maintenance activities at the request of Medicare providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transmitting remittance data electronically to providers or their banks directly from the servicing Medicare bank,
and/or electronically transmitting beneficiary and provider data along with payment information from the servicing
Medicare bank to providers, their banks or a VAN service, allows for more efficient payment and reconciliation processes
for both HCFA and providers. The new routine use number (24), for the IMCR, and (26), for the CMCR, will read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(24)/(26) Servicing Fiscal Intermediary/Carrier banks, Automated Clearing Houses, VANs and provider banks to
the extent necessary to transfer to providers electronic remittance advices of Medicare payments, and with respect
to provider banks, to the extent necessary to provide account management services to providers using this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical amendments have been made to routine use number (24)/(26) for consistency with the current notices. The
IMCR and CMCR systems maintain information for the purpose of processing and paying Medicare benefits to or on behalf
of eligible individuals. The proposed new routine use is consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7), since
it is compatible with this purpose. In accordance with OMB Guidelines (Circular A&hyph;130, 58 FR 36068, 36077 July
2, 1993), this addition of a routine use constitutes a significant change in the system of records. Accordingly, we
have prepared a report of an altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(r). In addition, for the convenience of the
reader, we are publishing the notice for both systems in their entirety below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Discussion of Proposed Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We are changing the name of the system of records and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of its purpose to clarify the fact that it includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for Social Security numbers (SSNs) submitted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspicious or fraudulent evidence, as well as the records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who have applied for and been assigned SSNs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vast majority of SSN applications with complete evidence are soon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved and SSNs are assigned to the applicants in a few days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, however, an application may be held and a record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained for up to 120 days while SSA determines whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of identity, age or citizenship/alien status is proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and authentic. SSA disallows applications which are supported by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraudulent documents, and maintains records of such applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These records prevent individuals whose applications are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported by fraudulent or suspicious documents from obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSNs by visiting other SSA offices which might unwittingly accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Besides changing the name of the system and showing that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose includes protecting against SSN applications supported by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspicious or fraudulent evidence, we have changed some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other language: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To show that the system covers paper applications for SSNs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as electronic records, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To explain how a record is retrieved when it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an SSN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Effect of the Proposed Changes on Individual Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed changes will clarify the types of information which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA maintains about persons who apply for SSNs. They will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no effect on individuals' rights.

With this system in place, clerical investigation and

case an applicant attempting to obtain an SSN might visit other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices and might attempt to find one which would unwittingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accept fraudulent documentation.

Records in this system are maintained in paper form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., paper lists, punch cards, Forms SS&hyph;5 (Application for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSN), and systems generated forms); magnetic media (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnetic tape and disk with on-line access); and in microfilm and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Records of SSN holders are indexed by both SSN 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and name. Records of applications that have been denied because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicant submitted fraudulent evidence, or that are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified because the evidence is suspected to be fraudulent, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indexed either by the applicant's name plus month and year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birth, or by the applicant's name plus the eleven-digit reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of the disallowed application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Safeguards for automated records have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in accordance with the HHS Automated Data Processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manual, ``Part 6, ADP Systems Security.'' This includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining the magnetic tapes and disks within a secured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure attended by security guards. Anyone entering or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaving this enclosure must have a special badge issued only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For computerized records electronically transmitted between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Central Office and Field Office locations (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations administering SSA programs under contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements), safeguards include a lock/unlock password system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive use of leased telephone lines, a terminal-oriented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction matrix, and an audit trail. All microfilm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microfiche, and paper files are accessible only by authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel who have a need for the records in the performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their official duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expansion and improvement of SSA's telecommunications systems has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in the acquisition of terminals equipped with physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key locks. The terminals also are fitted with adapters to permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the future installation of data encryption devices and devices to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the identification of terminal users.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
All paper forms are retained for 5 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after they have been filmed or entered on tape and the accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been verified. They then are destroyed by shredding. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tape, disks, microfilm, and microfiche files are updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodically. Out-of-date magnetic tapes and disks are erased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Out-of-date microfiches are disposed of by applying heat.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
HUD is committed to initiatives that will provide access to capital and economic empowerment for all Americans. HUD
has launched creative programs to stem disinvestment in cities and disadvantaged communities throughout the country,
increase the flow of capital into these communities, and create communities of opportunity throughout the nation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among HUD's priorities are: (1) Empowerment of local communities by supporting local economic development efforts;
(2) expansion of housing opportunities through partnerships with State and local government and private developers
and financial institutions; and (3) opening housing markets through vigorous enforcement of the Federal Fair Housing
Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619). A critical component of these initiatives is assuring access to capital for homeownership
and business development. Assuring fair access to property insurance is essential. Insurance is necessary for access
to capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, including the promulgation of regulations.
Prior to promulgation of a regulation on nondiscrimination in property insurance under the Fair Housing Act, HUD
is seeking public comment on: property insurance practices that may or may not be discriminatory; specific provisions
within the regulation; disclosure requirements and best practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Task Force on Occupancy Standards in Public and Assisted Housing was established on December 31, 1992 in accordance
with the provisions of section 643 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;550) and the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App 2). The Task Force's charter was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 7, 1993 at 58 FR 3039. The Task Force was created to review all rules, policy statements, handbooks and technical
assistance memoranda issued by the Department on the standards and obligations governing residency in public and
assisted housing; and make recommendations in its final report to HUD and Congress for the establishment of reasonable
criteria for occupancy, so that HUD could revise its standards, regulations, and guidelines to provide accurate
and complete guidance to owners and managers of federally assisted housing.

Preface_Funding and Finance Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout its deliberations and recommendations, one theme about which Occupancy Task Force members agreed was
that low-income people should have more housing choices than they do at present. The issue of housing choice, along
with many other concerns the Task Force addressed, is complicated by scarcity of resources. The Task Force therefore
proposes a number of recommendations aimed specifically at funding and cost issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 1_The Application Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing its report, the Occupancy Task Force decided that it would be more useful to begin by addressing the sequential
tenancy process: the application process, occupancy and eviction. The first stage of this process, during which
applicants are screened for eligibility and tenant selection criteria, is an extremely important one in that the
applicants who are selected will become members of the resident community and those who are not selected will be denied
the opportunity to live in federally assisted housing. Thus, the Task Force spent significant time considering the
issues contained in the Application Process Chapter. In doing so, the Task Force balanced the rights of housing providers
to choose residents who will fulfill their lease obligations and the rights of applicants to be chosen fairly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to including the Task Force's specific recommendations, Chapter One describes the application process
from start to finish in order to provide a full context for the recommendations. In particular, the application process
issues addressed by the Task Force include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application process ends when the housing provider makes the decision to admit an applicant. Next, the housing
management process begins, encompassing orientation, execution of the lease, move-in, occupancy and lease compliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eviction from public or assisted housing is a very serious sanction; it not only displaces the resident, it also discontinues
the subsidy that makes housing affordable to that resident. Eviction is nonetheless occasionally necessary. Experience
shows that some individuals are not willing to meet the essential obligations of tenancy and must be removed in order
to preserve the viability of the housing development. Given the shortage of public and assisted housing, and the difficulty
of preserving this housing, the Task force also stresses the need to remove those whose conduct is destructive to the
development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An equitable eviction policy will authorize the eviction, in appropriate circumstances, of those residents whose
conduct violates essential provisions of the lease, those whose conduct repeatedly violates minor provisions of
the lease, and those who allow others to do so. The Task Force reviews the proper use of eviction as focusing generally
on whether and how seriously the conduct in question adversely affects the housing community. In addition, the Task
Force recommends that except as noted, the status, regulations, handbooks and lease provisions regarding eviction
not be changed.

Chapter 4_Reasonable Accommodations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasonable accommodation is a creative, challenging and evolving area of disability law and practice, affecting
every aspect of admissions, occupancy and evictions. The Task Force believes that, despite many uncertainties as
to what is required by law, it is possible to craft sound, basic, reasonable accommodation policies and procedures
which will satisfy the intent of the law without subjecting either persons with disabilities or housing providers
to unintended burdens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This chapter tackles a wide range of reasonable accommodations issues with the intention of providing guidance on
the procedural elements essential to achieving compliance. Specifically, the chapter is organized as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulatory and case-law references that provide background on the concept of reasonable accommodation followed
by brief discussion of program accessibility requirements (the self-evaluation and transition plan);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Discussion of a definition of reasonable accommodation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Statement of principles applicable to reasonable accommodations, drawn from current law and regulation
and describing both affirmative requirements and the regulatory limits placed on the implementation of the concept;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Examination of the regulatory limits that apply to accommodations (undue burdens and fundamental alterations);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Recommendations on effective implementation of reasonable accommodations;

Chapter 5_Fundamental Alterations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 anticipate that, at some
level, the compliance action requested or required may exhaust available resources or so alter the housing program
that the action becomes infeasible. Housing providers are required to judge the feasibility of compliance actions
against two criteria; fundamental alternations in the nature of the program and undue financial and administrative
burdens. This chapter frames these issues in the context of program operations and management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fundamental alternations in the nature of the program and undue financial and administrative burdens raise issues
of resource management, capital planning, and ultimately, program funding. Many compliance actions can be absorbed
with existing program funds, but the cost of making some programs accessible and responding to some requests for accommodations
will require that Congress recognize the need for increased funding levels. Greater flexibility in HUD's rules governing
the use of operating and capital budgets is also required. Specific changes in budget operating procedures and formula
calculations are recommended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Task Force also makes a general recommendation to increase the level of modernization funds for both public and
assisted housing.

Chapter 6_Certificates and Vouchers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the course of its deliberations, the Task Force generally discussed issues that could be addressed in a unified
manner for all federally subsidized housing programs, such as the need for plain language forms and communications.
Thus, the Task Force wishes to make clear that all such global recommendations, such as the need for plain language
and timely and adequate notice, apply in the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Task Force also dealt with issues in the public housing and project-based assistance programs, such
as admissions procedures, that could not be so readily carried over into the context of the Certificate and Voucher
programs; this posed a particular challenge. In those programs the housing authority does not admit an applicant
to housing, is not the resident's landlord and does not evict. Instead, in a delicate balance among the three parties
involved, the housing agency provides a rental subsidy to the participant and, as a quid pro quo to the private landlord's
receipt of a portion of the market rent, enforces specific regulatory provisions incorporated into the Housing Assistance
Payments contract. Between the private landlord and the resident-recipient flow another set of rights and obligations,
arising from the lease, the HAP contract, federal law and regulation and state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this chapter, the Task Force has addressed only those issues that were of particular concern to Task Force members
or were congruent with issues raised in the project-based context. The Task Force has not attempted a wholesale critique
of the Certificate and Voucher programs not wholly rewritten any area of program administration. Nor has the Task
Force, in particular, dealt with the proposed regulations to consolidate the Certificate and Voucher programs,
which have not yet been implemented and so do not represent current practice. This Chapter includes recommendations
concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Expirations/extensions of time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Exemptions to fair market rents;

Chapter 7_Support Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This chapter examines the intersection of housing and services and makes recommendations to Congress, HUD and the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about improving coordination, access, and delivery of services in
an independent housing context. Many people who live in federally subsidized housing need, want and are eligible
for services that have some form of federal subsidy or some form of federal mandate or encouragement. Services could
help maintain tenancies and independence, promote economic and educations opportunity, and generally enhance
the lives and opportunities of those who live in federally subsidized housing. The Task Force believes that one major
problem is that the housing and service systems often do not understand one another or work in a coordinated way to help
the same individual. Because issues of coordination can be addressed only if HUD and HHS work together, this chapter
makes recommendations to HHS even though the Task Force was created to advise Congress about HUD matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part A of this chapter covers general services and housing issues and recommendations to ensure the provision of services
to residents. Part B reviews the planning and funding complexities of federal, state and local programs, including
recommendations to HUD and HHS. Part C discusses collaborative agreements between housing and services providers.

Chapter 8_Clearinghouse
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a number of discussions, the Task Force addressed the problems associated with the lack of effective coordination
among housing providers, supportive service providers, tenant representatives and advocates. We were also troubled
by the general unavailability of adequate, reliable, technical assistance on reasonable accommodation procedures
and substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Task Force concluded that one way of addressing both problems was to recommend that Congress require that each
state receiving federal housing assistance establish a model clearinghouse program, to be funded by the HOME and
CDBG programs. This chapter discusses the scope and purposes of such clearinghouses.

Chapter 9_Confidentiality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because every housing file contains personal information about applicants and residents, privacy and confidentiality
and persistent concerns. The civil rights and housing program laws and regulations all address some aspects of privacy
and confidentiality, but they leave many questions unanswered. Thus, the Task Force recommends that HUD research
the variety of questions and issues that the chapter lists, consult with interested parties, and issue prompt and
responsive guidance. The questions include issues relating to law enforcement, reasonable accommodations, resident
screening and eviction committees, state and local laws, and service coordinator and provider responsibilities.

Chapter 10_NIMBY
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIMBY, the Not In My Back Yard syndrome, both contributes to and is a form of housing discrimination. Like all forms
of discrimination, NIMBY has ripple effects on subsidized housing providers. When a neighborhood association successfully
prevents people with disabilities, people with low incomes, and people with no homes from moving in, it not only exacerbates
the pressure on subsidized housing providers to house these groups, but it reinforces the stereotype that subsidized
housing exists for the purpose of keeping ``the undesirables'' out of ``decent'' neighborhoods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIMBY, like the dearth of affordable housing, has permeated the Task Force's deliberations. Thus, the purpose of
this chapter is two-fold. It describes how community perceptions and stereotypes can limit housing opportunities
for individuals and families with low- and very low-incomes; while emphasizing that every individual and family
should have an opportunity to choose from a variety of housing options, including private, public, federally-assisted,
scattered site and supportive housing. Second, this chapter offers a number of specific recommendations to Congress

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Executive Agencies with regard to housing discrimination. This chapter is not an enforcement of one type of
housing option over others but rather an enforcement of individual choice and empowerment. The Task Force was unanimous
in its identification of discrimination as a major problem for everyone involved in the housing industry.

Closing Note on Recommendations to HUD
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the Task Force's recommendations for HUD action suggest that HUD develop ``guidance'' for housing providers.
The term ``guidance'' means examples, models, and samples, of letters, forms, procedures, systems, etc., designed
to help housing providers without imposing new requirements on them. The Task Force recommendations for guidance
should not be interpreted by HUD as creating new requirements.

and the Bureau's own observation. Those amendment proposals were included on the agenda at the public meeting of the
California Desert District Advisory Council Meeting on June 3&hyph;4, 1992. A Notice was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal to reclassify the above-described land from Multiple Use Class L to Class M was presented at the meeting
and no adverse comments were received. This Notice of Intent is being published to re-initiate the public scoping
period. The forty-acre parcel described above is being considered for direct sale at fair market value to General
Farm Investment Company, owner and operator of the farmland that borders three sides of this land. The subject land
extends into the farming operations and is an obstacle to efficient farming and irrigating. Disposal would establish
a more manageable ownership boundary benefiting both the Bureau of Land Management and General Farm. The proposed
plan amendment and decision on disposal will be determined through environmental analysis in accordance with 43
CFR 1610.5&hyph;5.

 Habitat Management Area (HMA) are closed to all mechanized/non-motorized vehicular use to preserve the habitat
of this Candidate plant species. This species, commonly called the small rockcress, is being proposed as Endangered
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Its single known population is located at Pine Creek, near South Pass, Wyoming,
and consists of approximately 1000 individuals. Approximately 500 acres of land within the Habitat Management Area
(HMA) exclosure will be closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vehicular use of the existing roads and trails in the area is causing unacceptable levels of damage to these plants
and their limited habitat adjacent to the roads and trails. Unauthorized vehicular use off these roads is also impacting
the species. Due to the extremely small population number, and the fragile nature of the plant, damage from vehicular
activity could be causing irreversible impacts to the species.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare Recovery Plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery Plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery
measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The document submitted for review is the draft Dismal Swamp Southeastern Shrew (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sorex longirostris fisheri
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Recovery Plan. This new subspecies, listed as threatened in 1986, is known to occur within the Great Dismal Swamp
of Virginia and North Carolina. Originally extending over 2200 square miles, the swamp now comprises fewer than 320
square miles. Some 189 square miles of habitat are protected within the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge
and adjacent North Carolina State Park land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Known habitat outside Refuge and Park boundaries is being list to agriculture, silviculture, and urbanization.
Within the Refuge, changes in the swamp's hydrologic regime are resulting in succession to a more mesic habitat type,
possibly allowing invasion by an upland subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sorex longirostris longirostris
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which could ultimately result in genetic extinction of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S.1. fisheri
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 through interbreeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New findings indicate that the Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew may be more widespread than previously thought; this
possibility is taken into account by defining dual recovery objectives: (1) To confirm that this shrew subspecies
is widely distributed throughout the coastal plain of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina and
is relatively free from threats; or (2) to perpetuate self-sustaining Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew populations
within more restricted areas in the wild. The attainment of either of these objectives would enable the shrew's removal
from the Federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditions that must be met to delist the Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew include either (1) confirmation of the shrew's
range, and, if studies confirm that it is restricted to areas of the Great Dismal Swamp; (2) maintenance of six ``shrew
conservation areas'' of at least 5,000 acres each; (3) management of hydrological conditions within shrew habitat;
(4) effective long-term management of other factors affecting the species; and (5) sufficient data to indicate that
``genetic swamping'' by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S.1. fisheri
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions will be met through distributional and taxonomic studies, hydrological studies, implementation
of management beneficial to the shrew within Refuge and Park boundaries, protection of shrew habitat outside Refuge
boundaries, and a public information program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the
review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), notice is hereby given that the Department
of the Interior is deleting from its inventory of Privacy Act systems of records a notice describing records maintained
by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The system of records notice being abolished is entitled
``Applicant/Violator System (AVS)_Interior, OSMRE&hyph;9'' It was previously published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 16, 1989 (54 FR 47734). A review of the system of records has determined that the records are not subject
to the Privacy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review was prompted by an opinion issued by the General Counsel, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), on August
30, 1988, affirming OMB's 1975 guidelines which interpreted the statutory term ``individual'' to exclude natural
persons acting in an entrepreneurial capacity from the coverage of the Privacy Act. A review of the Applicant/ Violator
System conducted by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement indicated that the records contain
information about persons in their entrepreneurial capacity and not in their capacity as individuals. Therefore,
the notice is being deleted from the Department's compilation of Privacy Act systems of records notices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indiana Rail Road Company and CSX Transportation, Inc._Joint Relocation Project Exemption_in Bloomington,
Monroe County, IN 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 11, 1994, The Indiana Rail Road Company (INRD) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate
a line of railroad. The transaction, which is the subject of ongoing agreements among INRD, CSX Transportation, Inc.
(CSXT), and the City of Bloomington, IN, is to be consummated either by July 21, 1994, or at a later date to be agreed upon
in writing among the parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project involves INRD's relocating a portion of its Bloomington Southern Branch track and operations in Bloomington,
Monroe County, IN, from the present location to a nearby track owned and operated by CSXT. The relocation of operations
covers 3.05 miles on the CSXT line. INRD and CSXT propose to consolidate rail traffic over the CSXT line extending from
the CSXT&hyph;INRD ``Uptown Connection'' between the CSXT line and INRD's main east-west line to the CSXT McDoel
Yard connection to INRD's Southern Branch near Country Club Road. As part of the relocation INRD will remove a 1.2 mile
portion of its Southern Branch track extending south from INRD's main line. INRD trains will operate over the CSXT
track to reach industry located on the Southern Branch in southwestern Bloomington. INRD states that a trackage agreement
is being formalized with CSXT and copies will be filed with the Commission when the agreement is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The line relocation project will eliminate excess and duplicate railroad facilities, remove unnecessary railroad-street
crossings, and furnish the City of Bloomington with a needed roadway corridor to be accomplished by the removal of
INRD track. INRD asserts that service to shippers will not be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment component of a relocation project, and require separate
approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion
into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See, generally, Denver &amp; R.G.W.R. Co._Jt.
Proj._Relocation over BN, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may
embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one involved here. See D.T.&amp; I.R._Trackage Rights, 363 I.C.C.
878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental trackage rights component requires no separate approval
or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies for the
class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions in

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN,

354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on INRD's counsel: John H. Doeringer,
20180 Governors Highway, Olympia Fields, IL 60461.

In accordance with Departmental policy, notice is hereby given that a proposed Modification to Consent Decree with
an Intervening Plaintiff and the Defendants in

 C.A. No. 85&hyph;3073 (E.D. Pa.), was lodged on June 29, 1994, with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania. This proposed Modification to Consent Decree conforms the remedy for certain groundwater
contamination affecting municipal drinking water wells in Hatboro Borough, Pennsylvania to the remedy chosen by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') in its Record of Decision (``ROD'') to abate groundwater
contamination at and under a Site located at Jacksonville Road, Hatboro Borough commonly referred to as the ``Raymark
Site.'' The original Consent Decree was entered prior to EPA's publication of the ROD and required the Hatboro Borough
Municipal Authority (which had been compensated under the Decree by Defendants' payments of $612,500) to perform
pumping and treating of water at a location different than that later set forth in the ROD. Under the proposed Modification
to Decree, Hatboro will remain responsible for performing work which ultimately will exhaust the $612,500 it received
under the Decree, as well as interest earned on those funds. EPA will perform all other remedial measures, using Superfund
money.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed Consent Decree Modification. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General

with response actions taken at the Shaffer Equipment Superfund Site (``Site'') located in Mindon, West Virginia.
The proposed decree with Anna Shaffer and Shaffer Equipment Company resolves the claims of the United States against
those defendants for response costs incurred at the site up to December 22, 1993 for a payment by those defendants of
$600,000 to the United States. The consent decree with Berwind Land Company resolves claims against Berwind Land
Company for past and future response costs incurred and to be incurred at the site for a payment by Berwind Land Company
of $75,000 to the United States. Shaffer Equipment Company and Berwind Land Company agree in the consent decrees to
provide access to the United States to their property at the site for any future response actions. The consent decree
with Johns Hopkins University resolves claims against Johns Hopkins University for past and future response costs
incurred and to be incurred at the Site for a payment by Johns Hopkins University of $50,000 to the United States.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 USC 3303a(a).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency by the grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings
will consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is revising its general statement of policy regarding the review of Agreement
State radiation control programs. This action is necessary to clarify the meaning and use of the terms ``adequate''
and ``compatible'' as applied to an Agreement State radiation control program. This draft policy statement would
not be intended to have the force and effect of law or binding effect; it is intended as guidance to the Agreement States,
NRC staff, and the public to make clear how the Commission intends to evaluate the adequacy and compatibility of NRC
and Agreement State programs. Comments are solicited on the draft policy statement and specific questions contained
in this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms ``compatible'' and ``adequate'' constitute core concepts in the Commission's Agreement State program
under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, in 1959. Subsection 274d. states that the Commission
shall enter into an Agreement under subsection b., discontinuing NRC's regulatory authority over certain materials
in a State, if the State's program is both adequate to protect public health and safety and compatible with the Commission's
regulatory program. Subsection 274g. authorizes and directs the Commission to cooperate with the States in the formulation
of standards to assure that State and Commission standards will be coordinated and ``compatible.'' Subsection 274(j)(1)
requires the Commission to periodically review the Agreements and actions taken by the States under the Agreements
to ensure compliance with the provisions of section 274. Although the terms ``compatible'' and ``adequate'' are
fundamental requirements in the Agreement State program under Section 274 of the AEA, these terms are not defined
in the Act. Neither has the Commission provided a formal definition or formal comprehensive guidance on how the terms
should be interpreted in implementing Section 274. The guiding concept over the years since the beginning of the Agreement
State program in the area of compatibility has been to encourage uniformity to the maximum extent practicable while
allowing flexibility, where possible, to accommodate local regulatory concerns. This concept has been implemented
in case-by-case decisions by the Commission and in internal procedures developed by the staff to assign designations
of degrees of ``compatibility'' (i.e. uniformity), from ``essentially verbatim'' to ``no degree of uniformity
required,'' to sections of the Commission's regulations. More recently, the Commission has attempted to involve
the States earlier in the process of developing new regulations and determining what level of ``compatibility''
(i.e. uniformity) will be required of the Agreement States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's approach to making compatibility determinations has evolved slowly over the life of the Agreement
State program. At the same time, since 1962, the Agreement State program has expanded and developed significantly
both in the number of Agreement States, as well as depth of experience and expertise of State regulators. To clarify
the matter of compatibility, the Commission has directed the staff to develop a comprehensive interpretation and
application of compatibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 2, 1993, the Commission directed the staff to develop a compatibility policy for all program areas other than
low level radioactive waste. While developing the policy, the staff participated in discussions with the Agreement
States, the non-Agreement States, the regulated community, and the general public. A working group was formed and
a draft issues paper was developed. The draft issues paper was discussed with the Agreement States in a public meeting
in May 1993 and draft options, SECY&hyph;93&hyph;290, were discussed in October 1993 at the All Agreement States
Meeting. The Agreement and non-Agreement States, the regulated community and the general public participated in
a public workshop on the final issues paper in July 1993.

A. States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The States would like to see a minimum number of requirements for compatibility determinations. From the comments
at the July 1993 public workshop and during the October 1993 All Agreement States Meeting in Tempe, Arizona, the following
positions, though not a formal consensus, emerged: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States are in favor of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. uniformity of requirements that are necessary to assure interstate commerce, i.e., labels, signs and symbols.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. uniformity of radiation standards necessary to protect public health and safety. However, States want the flexibility
to set stricter dose limits when local conditions warrant them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
3. early and substantive involvement in the deliberations on the development of regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulated Community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulated community desires strict adherence to uniform national radiation standards so that licensees meet
the same standards in all States and will not be subject to different regulations in different States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Environmental Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental advocacy group indicated that Federal and State regulations should be the minimum requirements
with the proviso that communities may have the flexibility to go beyond those regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the formulation of this draft policy statement, the staff has carefully considered the views of the Agreement States,
the regulated community, the environmental group and other members of the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The question posed by the current task to develop a compatibility policy centers on making a determination of what
components or elements of a State radiation control program are needed beyond those which establish and maintain
an adequate radiation control program. Presently, adequacy of Agreement State programs is only applied to program
elements in terms of their direct or indirect bearing on public health and safety and compatibility is only applied
to the degree of conformity between State regulations and NRC's regulations. However, staff believes that some regulations
should be a matter of adequacy to protect public health and safety and some program elements should be a matter of compatibility.
In order to fully understand this concept, the relationship between adequacy and compatibility must be examined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act requires that Agreement State programs be both ``adequate to protect the public
health and safety'' and ``compatible with the Commission's program.'' Thus, under the proposed compatibility policy,
these separate findings must be based on consideration of two different objectives; first, providing for an acceptable
level of protection for public health and safety in an Agreement State (the ``adequacy'' component), and second,
providing for the overall national interest in radiation protection, (the ``compatibility'' component). An ``adequate''
program, including regulations or other legally binding measures (e.g., license conditions) and program elements
(e.g., organization and resources) should consist of those attributes considered necessary by the Commission to
maintain an acceptable level of protection of the public health and safety within the Agreement State. A ``compatible''
program, including radiation protection standards and other program elements, should consist of those attributes
considered necessary by the Commission to meet a larger national interest in radiation protection. The requirements
for adequacy would focus on the protection of public health and safety within a particular State, whereas the requirements
for compatibility would focus on the extraterritorial effect of State action or inaction either on other States or
on the national program for radiation protection. As a basis for determining what ultimately will be required for
compatibility, the Commission must first identify what is necessary for a State program to be ``adequate.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the draft policy, ``adequate'' would focus on those elements of a State program that are necessary to provide
a level of protection of the public health and safety within the State that is equivalent to, or greater than, that provided
by the NRC regulatory program for its licensees. The requirements for ``adequate'' would not require that NRC regulations
or other program elements be incorporated in an essentially identical manner. Under the adequate provision, States
would also be allowed to establish requirements through measures other than regulations, such as license conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Compatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``compatibility'' requirement would focus on those elements of a State program which would be required to be essentially
identical with the NRC regulatory framework in order to achieve a larger national interest beyond that required for
adequate protection of the public health and safety within the State. The draft policy establishes four criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the NRC would use to determine which elements of the NRC regulatory program, including specific NRC regulations,
that the State would be required to incorporate in an essentially identical manner into its regulatory program. The
dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable to all licensees,
or any subsequent amendments thereto, or other NRC regulations which are required to be essentially identical for
compatibility purposes will automatically be required to be identical.

In issuing this Draft Policy Statement for comment, the Commission is revisiting its earlier decision to review compatibility
of Agreement State programs in the low level radioactive waste area on a case-by-case basis. The Commission based
its earlier decision on a belief that such case-by-case consideration could best address the special circumstances
that confront Agreement States in that area. Using the case-by-case approach, the Commission has determined that
the low level radioactive waste regulations of Pennsylvania and Illinois are compatible.

C. Compatibility and Adequacy Determination of Agreement States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has developed a management directive for the use of common performance indicators in review of the Agreement
States and regional materials program. The development of the common performance indicators for the evaluation
of Agreement States and the NRC regional offices will be directly related to adequacy requirements for Agreement
State programs, and consequently, will need to be closely coordinated with the staff efforts to define the elements
of an adequate State program. In January 1994, the staff provided to the Commission a paper further describing the
use of common performance indicators in NRC region and Agreement State reviews. The staff is currently implementing
a pilot program on the common performance indicators program. The current proposed common performance indicators
program contemplates using a Management Review Board (MRB) to make the decision on the adequacy of existing Agreement
State programs. The initial adequacy determination of a proposed new Agreement State program will be made by the Office
of State Programs, rather than the MRB, because the adequacy of a proposed new program is not dependent on effectiveness
of actual program implementation. The staff plans to follow this same split of responsibilities for the compatibility
determination of an Agreement State program, with the MRB making the compatibility determinations for existing
Agreement State programs, and the Office of State Programs making the initial compatibility determinations for
proposed new programs. The initial adequacy and compatibility determinations for proposed new Agreement State
programs are reviewed and approved by the Commission. Indicators of compatibility will also be developed by the staff.

D. Termination of Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Termination of an Agreement can occur when an Agreement State program is either inadequate or incompatible. The proposed
MRB, reviewing discrete common performance indicators, would judge the overall adequacy of an Agreement State program.
Similarly, the MRB would review discrete ``compatibility indicators'' and determine the overall compatibility
of an Agreement State program. For either of the adequacy or compatibility determination, failure to satisfy an individual
indicator may not necessarily result in an overall finding of inadequacy or incompatibility. In some situations,
individual indicator weakness(es) could result in a ``marginal'' finding by the MRB calling for Agreement State
improvements and the State program may be placed on probation. In extreme cases, indicator(s) failure could lead
to inadequate or incompatible findings resulting in the initiation of program suspension or termination. In terms
of the compatibility evaluation, the significance of performance indicator ``incompatibility'' in an individual
State will be judged on the basis of the impact on the national program.

E. Specific Questions for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In responding to this notice, the following questions should be specifically addressed along with any additional
comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Under what circumstances should Agreement States be permitted to establish more stringent requirements, for
their licensees, than those established by the Commission? Should this also include the ability to establish stricter
dose limits for particular classes of licensees? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are the four criteria in the proposed policy statement for determining whether a Commission regulation or other
program element should be adopted in a manner essentially identical by the Agreement States sufficient to ensure
protection of the national interest in radiation protection? What examples could be used to illustrate how each criterion
would be applied? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What are some examples of State action to establish stricter requirements than those established by the Commission,
or establish requirements where the NRC has not? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What limits, if any, should be placed on the power of a State to preclude or, by exceptionally stringent regulations,
effectively preclude a particular practice? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Are there any other dose or radiation-protection related release limits in the Commission's regulations which
should be included under the criterion number 3 of the compatibility criteria? Should the dose limits contained in
10 CFR Part 61 be included under this criterion? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Should the draft adequacy and compatibility policy statement be applicable to the regulation of low-level waste
disposal instead of continuing to consider questions of compatibility in this area on a case-by-case basis? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Are there currently areas or situations in Agreement State regulations or other Agreement State requirements
that would not meet the proposed policy statement? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should States be permitted to establish more stringent standards for radiation-protection related release limits?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Policy Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this Policy Statement is to provide a comprehensive interpretation and application of the terms ``adequate''
and ``compatible'' as they apply to the NRC Agreement State regulatory programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``compatible'' and ``adequate'' constitute core concepts in the Commission's Agreement State program
under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, in 1959. Subsection 274d. states that the Commission
shall enter into an Agreement under subsection b., discontinuing NRC's regulatory authority over certain materials
in a State, if the State's program is both adequate to protect public health and safety and compatible with the Commission's
regulatory program. Subsection 274g. authorizes and directs the Commission to cooperate with the States in the formulation
of standards to assure that State and Commission standards will be coordinated and ``compatible.'' Subsection 274j(1)
requires the Commission to periodically review the Agreements and actions taken by the States under the Agreements
to insure compliance with the provisions of section 274.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of evaluating the adequacy of Agreement State regulatory programs to protect public health and safety,
the following terms are defined: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acceptable level of protection for the public health and safety from the radiation hazards associated with the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. An Adequate Agreement State Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An effectively implemented regulatory program containing elements considered necessary by the Commission to provide
an acceptable level of protection for the public health and safety from the radiation hazards associated with the
use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Compatible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The consistency between NRC and Agreement State regulatory programs which is needed for the regulation of byproduct,
source and special nuclear material which assures an orderly and effective regulatory pattern in the administration
of the national radiation protection program. Compatibility shall be aimed at ensuring that interstate commerce
is not impeded, that effective communication in the radiation protection field is maintained, that dose limits and
radiation-protection related release limits applicable to all licensees are maintained, and that information
needed for the study of trends in radiation protection and other national program needs is obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. A Compatible Agreement State Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory program containing elements considered necessary by the Commission to effectively implement the term
``compatible'' as defined above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Element 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Element'' or ``program element'' is used to describe any of the essential components and functions of a radiation
protection regulatory program. The term includes any aspect of a radiation protection regulatory program that is
necessary to implement a program that is adequate to protect public health and safety and is compatible with the NRC
regulatory program. The term ``element'' may include organizational structure, staffing level, inspection frequency,
regulations, policies and procedures or any other component or function that the Commission considers necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``practice'' describes a use, procedure or activity associated with the application, possession, storage
or disposal of byproduct, source and special nuclear materials. The term ``practice'' is very broad and encompassing
in nature. For example, the term ``practice,'' as applied in the policy statement, not only applies to very general
activities involving radioactive materials such as industrial radiography, low-level waste disposal, nuclear
medicine procedures, and well logging, but also includes specific activities conducted within these very broad
activities, such as shallow land burial, sanitary sewerage disposal, and incineration of materials.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the provisions above, the Agreement States shall exercise their regulatory authority in a responsible
manner and shall not adopt more stringent regulations or requirements as a means to bar or preclude a practice without
an adequate safety or environmental basis, or bar a practice needed in the national interest. In order to permit the
NRC to provide early coordination and oversight of any proposed more stringent regulations or requirements, NRC
will request Agreement States to identify any such regulations or requirements and provide opportunity for NRC review
before publication as a draft rule for comment or before the institution of the requirement as a legally binding measure.

_The adoption of transportation requirements for all Agreement States should be essentially identical to assure
that the flow of radioactive materials in or through another jurisdiction is not impeded. For example, if States were
allowed to change 10 CFR 71.47, ``External Radiation Standards for all Packages'' then it would be very difficult
to transport radioactive material packages.

_The basic dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits for all classes of licensees set forth in
Subpart C, ``Occupational Dose Limits,'' and Subpart D, ``Radiation Dose Limits for Individual Members of the Public,''
of 10 CFR Part 20 would need to be adopted essentially identical by all Agreement States along with any other subsequent
amendments to 10 CFR Part 20 that may set forth dose limits. 10 CFR Part 61.41, ``Protection of general population from
releases of radioactivity'' and 10 CFR Part 61.43, ``Protection of individuals during operations'' would also need
to be adopted essentially identically by all Agreement States.

As noted above, if the State program is equivalent to, or more stringent than, NRC's program to assure the protection
of the public health and safety, and it incorporates all the elements of the NRC program identified by the Commission
as necessary to achieve the national interest in radiation protection, including the requirement to establish regulations
which are uniform with the dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR
Part 61 applicable to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments thereto, then a State should generally have the
flexibility to tailor its program. More stringent requirements, other than the above mentioned dose limits and radiation-protection
release limits could be applicable to all classes of licensees in a State. For example, an Agreement State's recordkeeping
provisions for all licenses could be more stringent than NRC's. Other examples of State actions which impose stricter
requirements than NRC regulations, and which would be ``adequate'' under the draft policy statement, are_

Between 1957 and 1981, several State representatives expressed concern to the Commission over the risk from burials
of radioactive waste allowed by 10 CFR 20.304, that was in effect at that time. This regulation, ``Standards for Protection
Against Radiation; Burial of Small Quantities of Radionuclides'' provided that licensees could bury small quantities
of radionuclides without prior NRC approval. The State of Florida submitted a request to the NRC to be more stringent
by precluding this practice within the State because of its high ground water level. The State's exemption request
was reviewed and approved by the NRC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several States prohibit the practice of shallow land burial of low-level waste. These more stringent regulations
would be allowed under the draft policy statement even though a practice is prohibited. There is no overriding national
interest in allowing shallow land burial of low-level waste. A different result would likely be obtained if disposal
of low-level waste altogether was prohibited, unless the State was able to convince NRC of special public health and
safety or environmental basis for this action.

Texas has established a program for the certification of industrial radiography that is more rigorous than Commission
requirements. This program requires persons to perform 200 hours of on-the-job training, complete 40 hours of classroom
instruction and successfully complete an examination before receiving authorization to conduct radiographic
services with radioactive materials. (This example is based on the assumption that the training requirements in
10 CFR 34 do not meet any of the four compatible criteria.)

I
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Curators of the University of Missouri-Columbia (Licensee) is the holder of NRC License No. 24&hyph;00513&hyph;32
issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35. The license authorizes
the Licensee to conduct research and development, instrument calibration, student instruction and medical diagnosis
and therapy. The license was issued on April 6, 1962, was most recently amended on May 11, 1994, and is due to expire on
July 31, 1998.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From January 24 through January 28, 1994, the NRC conducted a safety inspection of licensed activities at the University
of Missouri-Columbia. Numerous apparent violations were identified during the inspection. The findings of the
inspection were documented in Inspection Report No. 030&hyph;02278/94001(DRSS) issued to the Licensee on February
23, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is concerned that the circumstances surrounding the numerous violations reflect inadequate control over
the safe use of licensed material. The Licensee met with the NRC staff during a management meeting on February 24, 1994,
and during an open enforcement conference on February 28, 1994, at the NRC Region III office to review the circumstances
that led to the violations. During the enforcement conference, the Licensee proposed various corrective actions
that could be taken to prevent recurrence of the violations and to ensure compliance with NRC requirements. The Licensee
agreed to submit these proposals to the NRC in writing for review and approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated March 9, 1994, the NRC concluded its assessment of the inspection findings and issued a Notice of Violation
and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) in the amount of $5,000. The violations identified during the inspection
are of significant regulatory concern because they indicated that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The radiation safety staff and radioactive material users had insufficient knowledge of license conditions
and NRC requirements and an inadequate sense of accountability regarding compliance with radiation safety requirements,
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Licensee management was ineffective in completing self-assessments that assured safe program implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice required the Licensee to respond to the specific violations. In addition to that response, the NRC requested
that the Licensee provide a Safety Performance Improvement Program (SPIP) which would result in: (1) A complete and
thorough evaluation of the radiation safety practices and program by qualified persons to determine how the Licensee
is currently complying with NRC regulations and the conditions of the license; (2) a compilation of radiation safety
deficiencies from that effort; (3) a complete root cause analysis of those deficiencies; and (4) a description of
corrective actions to accomplish the improvements necessary for lasting correction of the deficiencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 7, 1994, and May 25, 1994, the Licensee provided written responses to the Notice, including payment of the
$5,000 proposed civil penalty and a description of the SPIP. After discussion of the SPIP with NRC staff on June 14 and
June 17, 1994, the Licensee submitted a revised SPIP to the NRC on June 20, 1994. The Licensee's revised SPIP is divided
into four phases. The Licensee has agreed to follow the specific actions and time milestones outlined in the SPIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase One of the SPIP involves hiring and directing an independent health physics consulting firm to review the Licensee's
authorized activities and report the findings to the Licensee's management by July 15, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Phase Two of the SPIP involves assigning specific Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) members and Health Physics staff
members to groups of authorized users to assist users in complying with the licensed program and NRC regulations and
to provide a conduit for reporting the status of licensed activities to Licensee management. The Health Physics staff
will also be assigned segments of the radiation safety program to review and assure compliance with the license and
NRC requirements and, as necessary, draft procedures and associated documentation to implement the program. This
phase will also include: (1) Development of an internal enforcement program that addresses compliance with radiation
safety requirements and establishes protocols for implementing corrective actions; (2) assessment of personnel
training and qualifications; (3) evaluation of laboratory equipment; and (4) development of computerized management
systems. The Licensee also has committed to hire one additional health physicist to assist with the radiation safety
program improvement. Phase Two will be completed by the end of December 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase Three of the SPIP involves an ongoing assessment of the corrective actions taken in response to findings in Phases
One and Two, a second independent audit by an outside health physics consultant and annual audits by the RSO and RSC
with reports to the Chancellor, Provost, and Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services. Phase Three will be completed
by the end of December 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase Four involves continuing reassessment of the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the violations underlying the March 9, 1994 enforcement action, the public health and safety require improvement
of the Licensee's radiation safety program. The NRC staff has reviewed the Licensee's SPIP. I find that the Licensee's
commitments as set forth in its letter of June 20, 1994, are acceptable and necessary and conclude that if these commitments
are effectively implemented the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have
determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments in its June 20, 1994 letter be
confirmed by this Order. The Licensee agreed to the issuance of this Order during a telephone call between Mr. John
A. Grobe, Chief, Nuclear Materials Inspection Section II, Region III, NRC, and Dr. Susan Langhorst, Radiation Safety
Officer, of the Licensee's staff on July 12, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that, based on the
Licensee's consent to this Order and the significance of the necessary program improvements described above, the
public health and safety require that this Order be immediately effective.

Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 20, 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that, effective immediately,
license no. 24&hyph;00513&hyph;32 is modified as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee shall complete the specific action items within the time limitations stated in the Safety Performance
Improvement Program submitted to the NRC in its letter dated June 20, 1994. If additional time is required to meet a
step, a written request must be submitted with the reason for the request and the new timeframe for completion. Until
approved in writing by the Regional Administrator, Region III, the previously approved schedule must be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Administrator, Region III, may relax or rescind, in writing, any aspect of the above condition upon a
showing by the License of good cause.

Hearing and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region III, 801 Warrenville Road,
Lisle, Illinois 60532&hyph;4351, and to the Licensee. If such a person requests a hearing, that person shall set forth
with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating
the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this
Confirmatory Order should be sustained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), any person other than the Licensee adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate

I. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change modifies DGOC's exercise settlement procedures. Under current practice, the exercise
settlement date, depending on certain factors, occurs from two to five business days following the expiration date
or the date on which an exercise notice is tendered. For an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note exercised
on a day preceding the expiration date, the exercise settlement date is the next business day following the day on which
the exercise notice is properly assigned to a participant. The proposal makes no change to this provision of DGOC's
rules. For an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note exercised on the expiration date, the exercise settlement
date will now be the next business day following the expiration date for those contracts. Currently, the exercise
settlement date for such contracts is the third business day following the expiration date. Also, under the proposed
rule change, for an option contract on a Treasury bill, the exercise settlement date will be the next business day after
an exercise notice is properly tendered. Currently, the exercise settlement date is Thursday of the week in which
the exercise notice is properly tendered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the modifications to the exercise settlement date, DGOC has amended Section 1005 of its Procedures
to provide that DGOC will allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8:00 a.m. on the business day prior to
the exercise settlement date. Previously, DGOC allocated exercise settlement obligations on the second business
day prior to the exercise settlement date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DGOC also has amended Section 1102 of its Procedures to clarify its buy-in process applicable when a participant fails
to make a required delivery of Treasury securities to DGOC. First, upon the request of the participant failing to deliver
and with good cause shown, DGOC is now authorized to defer the execution of a buy-in if Delta has reason to believe that
the delivery default will be cured on that other arrangement adequate to protect Delta's interests have been made.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Previously, DGOC could defer the execution of a buy-in for no more than twenty-four hours from the time delivery was
due. Second, the timing for the execution of a buy-in has been set forth with specificity. Under the more specific procedures,
DGOC may transmit a notice of buy-in to the participant which failed to deliver after the elapse of thirty calendar
days after the failure to deliver. DGOC must deliver in duplicate a written notice of buy-in no later than 12:00 noon
five business days before the proposed execution date of the buy-in. The amended section also sets forth the information
DGOC must supply to the participant in the buy-in notice.

The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 require that the rules of clearing agencies be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and to assure
the safeguarding of funds which are under the custody or control of a clearing agency or for which it is responsible
and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One purpose of the proposal is to respond to participants who have requested that DGOC's settlement procedures more
closely follow the practices already established in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketplace for the settlement
of purchases and sales of Treasury securities and for the settlement of exercised options on such securities. by shortening
DGOC's settlement periods to conform to the industry standards, DGOC will reduce the amount of time such settlement
obligations remain outstanding which in turn will reduce credit exposure to DGOC as well as generally in the settling
of options on Government securities. DGOC's use of the same settlement period as is used in settlement of similar OTC
options will help to ensure a consistent approach among clearing entities and should serve as a platform for additional
coordination among clearing entities clearing identical or complimentary securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because DGOC's current settlement period of two to five business days is longer than the settlement period for similar
OTC products cleared outside of DGOC, DGOC-issued options carry a price adjustment for the additional financing
costs. As a result, the price of DGOC-issued options does not match exactly those of similar OTC-traded options. Implementation
of DGOC's revised settlement procedures will make the relative values of DGOC-issued options comparable to those
of OTC-traded options and will eliminate participants' need to make the additional calculations necessary to correlate
the price of DGOC-issued options with the price of OTC-traded options. Therefore, this proposal should provide participants
greater ease in trading and exercising options issued by DGOC. The proposal also should result in more options on Government
securities being cleared and settled through the automated facilities of DGOC, a registered clearing agency which
participates in the national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These are options
transactions that otherwise would be cleared through decentralized and labor intensive processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the shorter settlement time frames, the rule change enables DGOC to allocate exercise settlement
obligations prior to 8:00 a.m. on the day prior to settlement and, as noted above, permits accelerated settlement
time frames that are more consistent with settlement of exercised options and settlement of securities in the cash
market. These changes should help DGOC to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and should foster cooperation and coordination by persons engaged in the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions. The proposal also clarifies DGOC's buy-in procedures while providing DGOC with more
flexibility concerning buy-ins. The Commission believes that these changes improve DGOC's ability to deal with
the risks associated with the failure of a participant to fulfill its delivery obligation. By doing so, the modified
buy-in procedures better enables DGOC to fulfill its statutory obligations to safeguard securities and funds within
its possession or control for which it is responsible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of
the Act, particularly Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;93&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved.

may prescribe, to approve business trusts,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 limited liability companies,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and other organizational structures as member organizations. However, any such entity would be required to have
characteristics essentially similar to corporations or partnerships.

A limited liability company (``LLC'') combines various characteristics of both corporations and partnerships.
For example, an LLC is a non-corporate entity under which neither the owners nor those managing the business are personally
liable for the entity's obligations, however, the LLC is treated as a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes.

The NYSE staff would review each application on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization applicants.
However, prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1) the
Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's
capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it permits registered brokers or dealers
as set forth herein to become member organizations of the Exchange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is also consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it broadens the types of entities
which the Exchange may approve as a member organization and therefore avoids possible unfair discrimination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is consistent with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act in that it serves to remove possible burdens on competition
resulting from organizational structure not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.

On March 1, 1994, the PHLX amended PHLX Rule 1001A, ``Position Limits,'' to add paragraphs (d)(i) and (ii), which describe
the aggregation procedures for quarterly expiring options, reduced-value long-term Value Line Composite Index
options, and reduced-value long-term National Over-the-Counter Index options. See Letter from Edith Hallahan,
Special Counsel, PHLX, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission,
dated February 28, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). After the provisions proposed in paragraph (d)(i) were approved in
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34234 (June 17, 1994), the PHLX deleted paragraph (d)(i) from the current proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to list long-term reduced-value options equal to one-tenth the value of the Exchange's
current National Over-the-Counter Index (``Index'' or ``XOC''). Options on the long-term, reduced-value XOC (``reduced-value
XOC'') will have expirations of up to 36 months. For aggregation purposes, 10 reduced-value long-term XOC options
are the equivalent of one full-value XOC contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.

1. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1985 the PHLX has been trading options on the XOC, a broad-based, capitalization-weighted index comprised
of the 100 largest domestic corporations whose stocks are traded over-the-counter (``OTC'') by at least four market
makers and are not listed on any exchange.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 All of the XOC's component stocks are traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
(``NASDAQ'') system and are National Market Securities (``NMS''). On February 26, 1991, the Commission approved
a proposed rule change, SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;90&hyph;38, allowing the Exchange to list long-term options having
up to 36 months to expiration on any of the Exchange's broad-based index options.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX proposes to list long-term options on a reduced-value XOC index that would be computed at one-tenth the value
of the Exchange's current XOC index. The proposed options will have expirations of up to 36 months. The PHLX believes
that the listing of long-term, reduced-value XOC options will provide retail investors with the opportunity to obtain
long term portfolio protection at an affordable price.

2. Composition of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The XOC is a capitalization-weighted index comprised of the 100 most highly capitalized NMS common stock issues traded
through the NASDAQ system. The XOC, which was developed by the Exchange and is computed by Bridge Data, is comprised
of stocks from approximately thirty industry groups and responds to the general market trends of the OTC market. The
Index is updated every 15 seconds during the trading day. Pursuant to PHLX Rule 1100A, ``Dissemination of Information,''
updated Index values are disseminated and displayed by means of the Consolidated Last Sale Reporting System and the
facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). The closing Index value is published in The Wall
Street Journal and other financial publications.

3. Index Construction and Calculation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to keep the XOC current and representative of general market trends in the OTC market, each January and July
the Exchange identifies and ranks the 125 most highly capitalized NMS common stock issues. The stocks included in
the 125 ranking are compared to the issues in the Index, and issue(s) not ranked within the 100 most highly capitalized
issues are deleted from the Index and replaced by the issue(s) which has increased in capitalization since the previous
ranking. Thus, on a semi-annual basis, the XOC is adjusted to reflect changes in the capitalization ranking of NMS
stock issues. In addition, any time a component stock registers on a national securities exchange or is the subject
of a merger or acquisition, the stock is deleted from the Index and replaced by the next highest capitalized issue as
identified in the most current ranking of the 125 most highly capitalized NMS issues. The Index is adjusted to reflect
stock splits and dividends.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In computing the value of the Index, the current market value of each component stock is multiplied by the number of
outstanding shares. The resulting market values are added together to determine the current aggregate market value
of the issues in the Index. To compute the current Index value, the aggregate market value is divided by the base market
value and multiplied by 100. The base value is adjusted periodically to account for changes in capitalization of any
of the component stocks resulting from mergers, acquisitions, listings, and substitutions.

4. Contract Specifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed long-term reduced-value XOC options will trade independently of an in addition to currently listed
full-value XOC options and will be subject to the same rules that presently govern the trading of full-value XOC options,
including sales practice rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures. The strike price intervals
for the proposed options will be fixed at no less than $2.50, and the proposed options will be aggregated with full-value
XOC options for position and exercise limit purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHLX has determined that since positions in the full-value XOC options and those in the proposed reduced-value
long-term XOC options are based upon the same underlying stock index, the proposed reduced-value XOC options will
be aggregated with full-value XOC options for position and exercise limit purposes. Accordingly, the PHLX proposes
to amend PHLX Rule 1001A to state that for aggregation purposes, ten reduced-value long-term XOC options are the equivalent
of one full-value XOC contract. Since one full-value XOC contract is equivalent to ten reduced-value XOC contracts,
each reduced-value XOC contract will be considered one-tenth of a full-value XOC contract when the contracts are
aggregated for position and exercise limit purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, under the current XOC position limit of 10,000 contracts, an option holder with no full-size XOC contracts would
be permitted to hold 100,000 reduced-value XOC contracts. Similar to full-value XOC options, the proposed reduced-value
options will feature American-style exercise. The PHLX will continuously calculate and disseminate the underlying
index value for the proposed reduced-value XOC options in addition to the full-value Index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the one-tenth reduced-value feature of the proposed options, the reduced-value XOC may vary slightly
from one-tenth of the full-value Index. In this regard, the PHLX intends to adopt the following procedure in rounding
the reduced-value Index: the PHLX will divide the calculated value of the XOC by ten and round the resulting quotient
to the nearest one-hundredth. The digits one through four will be rounded down to the next number and digits five through
nine will be rounded up to the next number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon Commission approval of the proposal, the PHLX intends to list initial long-term option series on the new reduced-value
XOC with December 1995 and December 1996 expirations. While the initial series listings would have less than 36 months
to expiration, thereafter, the PHLX plans to list options with 36-month expirations at each December expiration,
resulting in the introduction of a December 1977 expiration after the December 1994 expiration. Initially, three
strike prices for calls and puts will be listed at and surrounding the prevailing reduced-value XOC option. However,
the Exchange may list only a put or a call if two strike prices are introduced. The Exchange also proposes to list additional
strike prices when the market reaches either the highest or lowest existing strike price. The Exchange believes this
procedure will result in the listing of only a limited number of series for any expiration, thereby eliminating confusion
that might otherwise be caused by a myriad of strike prices and expirations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange expects that its proposed policy of listing strike prices on the reduced-value XOC will permit the offering
of options at premiums between $2.00 and $7.00 ($200 to $700 per contract) based upon current market volatility and
other pricing considerations. Such premiums appear to be in the desired range of prices that investors have favored
in trading index warrants. Such premiums could not be achieved by using full-size XOC options without the listing
of strike prices so deeply out of the money and away from the current index value as to offer investors limited ability
to participate in the market or protect a portfolio of primarily OTCV stocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and in particular, with Section
6(b)(5), in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the reduced-value long-term XOC options will benefit investors by providing
them with a valuable hedging and investing vehicle that should reflect accurately the overall movement of the OTC
market and provide investors with additional means to hedge portfolios against long-term market risk at a reduce
cost. The Commission believes that the lower cost of the reduced-value XOC options should allow investors to hedge
their portfolios with a smaller outlay of capital and may facilitate investor participation in the market for XOC
options, which should, in turn, help to maintain the depth and liquidity of the market for XOC options, thereby protecting
investors and the public interest.

 and does not believe that dividing the XOC by ten changes this determination. The reduced-value XOC index will contain
the same stocks with the same weightings as the XOC and will be calculated in the same manner as the XOC (with the exception
of being one-tenth the value of the XOC). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the reduced-value XOC is a broad-based
index. Moreover, the Commission believes that any potential manipulation concerns raised by the reduced-value
XOC options are minimized by the fact that positions in the reduced-value XOC options and full-value XOC options will
be aggregated for position and exercise limit purposes.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission notes that the same Exchange surveillance procedures applied to full-value XOC options
will be used for the reduced-value XOC options.

In this regard, it is reasonable for the PHLX to count ten reduced-value XOC option contract as equivalent to one full-value
XOC contract for position and exercise limit purposes because the underlying value of one XOC contract is equal to
the underlying value of ten reduced-value XOC contracts.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Exchange's existing rules applicable to stock index options, including, among others, sales practice
rules, margin requirements, and position and exercise limits, will apply to the reduced-value XOC options, the Commission
believes that the market for the reduced-value XOC options should be fair and orderly and does not raise any new customer
protection concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposal and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In light of the fact that the Commission has approved proposals by other exchanges to list reduced-value options
on existing indexes, and in light of PHLX rule 1101A(b)(iii), which allows the PHLX to list series of long term options
on stock indexes, the Commission believes that the proposal to list long term reduced-value XOC options presents
no new regulatory issues. In addition, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 clarify and strengthen
the Exchange's proposal. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act to approve the proposal
and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 on an accelerated basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by Kent County, Michigan, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal
responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On October 29, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure
maps submitted by Kent County under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On April 26, 1994, the
Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Kent County International Airport noise compatibility program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of ten (10) measures were included in the Kent County International Airport recommended program. Of the ten
(10) measures, two (2) are ``Program Management,'' three (3) are ``Noise Abatement,'' and five (5) are ``Land Use.''
The FAA gave outright approval for nine (9) measures; the tenth measure was given partial approval.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Kent County
International Airport, effective April 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to
the following determinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated
in FAR Part 150, &sect;150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Detroit Airports District Office in Belleville, Michigan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kent County submitted to the FAA on May 4, 1992, noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced
during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from September 24, 1987 through May 4, 1992. The Kent County
International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements
on March 4, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kent County International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions
designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion
to the year 1995. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program
as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on October 29, 1993, and was required
by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period would have been deemed
to be an approval of such program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submitted program contained ten (10) proposed actions for noise mitigation. The FAA completed its review and
determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall
program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective April 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outright approval was granted for nine (9) of the specific program elements. ``Land Use Measure No. 2'' was partially
approved. The measure included non-noise related zoning (height and safety). For the purpose of Part 150, only the
noise zoning was approved. The other approved measures include: Noise Abatement Advisory Committee, Noise Complaint
Program, Noise Abatement Departure Procedures, Greater Percent of Stage 3 Aircraft, Portable Noise Monitoring
Equipment, Comprehensive Land Use Planning and Zoning, Utilize Disclosure Ordinance, Acoustical Treatment/Aviation
Easements, and Purchase Assurance Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on April 26, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and documents which comprised the
submittal to the FAA, are available for review at the following locations.

Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment
Centers (FICs). On February 28, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Funding Availability announcing the first
competition for grant funds under the program (59 FR 9592; amended at 59 FR 18570 (April 19, 1994) and 59 FR 29816 (June
9, 1994)). In the February 28 notice, the Department also indicated that it:

*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;intends to use $1 million for purposes of demonstrating ways for families living in public
and Indian housing in a neighborhood undergoing a concentrated effort of local revitalization to gain access to education
and employment activities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, by enabling housing authorities to develop
training and support services. These funds will be used to mobilize public and private resources to expand and improve
delivery of services, to provide funding for essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded,
to improve the capacity of management to assess the training and services needs of eligible families, to coordinate
the provision of training and services that meet such needs and to ensure the long-term provision of such training
and services. The Department expects that this funding will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive support
services in contributing to the local neighborhood revitalization.

Background of Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Community Building in Partnership (CBP) is a long-term partnership between the residents of the Sandtown-Winchester
neighborhood, the City of Baltimore (Maryland), and The Enterprise Foundation. CBP acts as a focal point for coordinated
planning and action to achieve objectives set by the residents of Sandtown-Winchester, as supported by planning
professionals and City staff, over a two-year planning and program design period. The Housing Authority of Baltimore
City (HABC) also is integrally involved in the effort to transform the neighborhood, which contains over 850 units
of public housing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this demonstration, the Department will make up to $1 million available to the HABC for use in establishing
a FIC in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood. The funding will be used in accordance with the statutory requirements
of the FIC program to contribute to an integrated network of supportive services for public housing and other neighborhood
residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The system of services and outreach planned by the community, CBP, the City, and the HABC will not only increase the
intensity and variety of educational and supportive services available to neighborhood residents, it will also
establish a delivery system involving residents who will work with neighbors to ensure progression towards self-sufficiency.
Residents involved as ``Family Advocates'' will work with trained social workers to manage the most complex cases.
Together with service providers, the advocates and case workers will form ``Family Support Teams'' and will create
a new system to integrate, at the community level, the multiple supportive service programs that affect most Sandtown-Winchester
residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focal point of this service provision and outreach activity will be a Family Resource Center located in a City-owned
facility on Mount Street in Sandtown-Winchester. Most of the funding provided under this demonstration will be used
to renovate and expand the Mount Street facility. Remaining funds will be used for service coordination by the Family
Support Teams and for core support services. Core support services will help families and individuals to overcome
personal difficulties that inhibit their readiness to work, and will include such services as literacy and G.E.D.
training and drop-in day care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the FIC funding proposed under this demonstration, public and private organizations will support
the Family Resource Center, its core services, and the Family Support Teams. This network will deliver necessary
services to public housing residents as part of the larger community, through the community-wide system developed
by HABC, the City, and CBP. The Department believes that the institutional integration_of which this demonstration
will be one part_will enhance the quality, continuity, and impact of support provided to public housing residents.
HABC will be a particularly active partner in this endeavor, drawing upon its experience with the Family Development
Center at Lafayette Courts, which provided one of the models for the national FIC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Core support services and Family Support Team activities supported by FIC funding provided under this demonstration
will be targeted to ensure that a proportionate number of public housing families are served. Funding from other sources
will support the provision of services to other neighborhood residents. Private foundations and the City of Baltimore
have both committed funding and in-kind donations to the project. The Department expects that this demonstration
will leverage more public and private funding as the project progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will allocate up to $1 million to HABC to carry out its part of the project, pending receipt and approval
of an application that is consistent with program and submission requirements as established in this notice and any
subsequent notice issued after the comment period has closed.

Throughout the nation, collaborations between community-based organizations and private foundations are establishing
partnerships to address the full range of human needs in disadvantaged communities_public safety, education, job
training and placement, health and human services, housing and open space development, and others. These comprehensive
community development and revitalization efforts seek not only to accomplish specific projects, but also to build
community-based institutions that will continue to provide for residents' needs over the long term. Government
at the local, State and Federal levels, as well as corporate partners and intermediary development organizations,
have become involved in these projects to varying degrees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Baltimore, the CBP comprehensive community-based strategy is especially well-advanced. Working with the CBP,
the City of Baltimore and its Housing Authority have made the transformation of the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood
one of their highest priorities. The CBP partnership aims to ``transform all of the dysfunctional conditions and
systems in Sandtown to enable all residents to achieve their highest potential.'' The dysfunctional systems the
partnership addresses cross the full range of typical public and human services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional Federal, State, and private participants in the transformation of the neighborhood include: the United
States Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Health and Human Services; the Maryland
State Housing Finance Agency and Community Development Agency; the National Community Development Initiative;
the Kellogg Foundation; the Abell Foundation; the Mott Foundation; the Goldseker Foundation; the Strauss Foundation;
Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company; NationsBank; Habitat for Humanity; local churches; and many local community
development groups, including Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The community of Sandtown-Winchester contains the 571-unit Gilmor Homes public housing development, as well as
over 300 scattered-site public housing units. Nearly half of Sandtown-Winchester residents able to work are unemployed;
one-third of the residents have no health insurance. The rate of death from influenza and pneumonia is 2.5 times that
of the City of Baltimore. The rate of HIV infection is double that of the City, and is sixth in the State of Maryland. Students
in local public schools consistently perform far below state standards on reading, writing, and math tests, and absenteeism
is a major problem. Forty-nine percent of all residents live in poverty, and five of six poor children live in single-parent
households headed by women. The Sandtown-Winchester crime rate is one of the highest in the City. Typical systems
for delivering basic public services of employment, human services, health, education, housing, and public safety
have not met the complex and interrelated needs of the residents in Sandtown-Winchester, who have needs typical of
residents in many disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large amounts of resources have flowed into the neighborhood from various public and private sources, particularly
from government programs meant to address only distinct elements of the many interrelated problems, which have persisted
from generation to generation, that are faced by Sandtown-Winchester's residents. CBP is working to change the delivery
systems for these programs and resources, to make these services and housing opportunities more accessible to and
effective for neighborhood residents. Through the Family Support Teams that will work with clients and their changing
needs, the Family Resource Center will transform the delivery system for supportive services from a fragmented maze
into a highly responsive personal- and neighborhood-based system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the core services planned to be available at the Family Resource Center, public housing and other residents
of the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood will be able to access other CBP and partner activities and programs. The
Family Resource Center, with its outreach and case management capabilities, will identify residents' needs, connect
them to neighborhood-based and City-wide service providers, and monitor their clients' progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs available to residents will include community-based job training, job placement and small business technical
assistance, and health care that is focused on preventative measures and primary health care needs. A new Neighborhood
Development Center has begun to coordinate the efforts of several community development corporations and other
housing providers to construct or renovate housing in the area and to offer counselling and referrals for rental,
special needs, and ownership opportunities. Plans to treat substance abuse in the neighborhood include residential,
outpatient, support group, and in-home counselling. Youth education and activities programs will include targeted
outreach to children from birth to five years of age, to ensure school readiness through a variety of support strategies.
Extensive school to work programs and expanded summer recreation and after-school activities involving parents
are also planned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the initiative already taken at the local level and the working partnership forged there, the Sandtown-Winchester
neighborhood transformation project is an ideal demonstration environment for service delivery integrated across
existing Federal program lines. Too often, the requirements of Federal programs have dictated institutional structures
at the local level that stand in the way of comprehensive delivery of housing and services to those who need these services
to achieve self-sufficiency. The City of Baltimore, HABC, and the community have all come together, supported by
The Enterprise Foundation and many private contributors, to implement the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood transformation.
This coordination creates a rare opportunity for the Department to test the capacity of its existing programs to serve
in the context of a truly integrated and comprehensive transformation effort.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through this demonstration, the Department will explore ways to encourage neighborhood transformation partnerships
by, for example, meshing its programs to the needs of the local agencies to coordinate the delivery of programs and
services. The strategy to which the demonstration will contribute will integrate public housing residents fully
into the services and activities available to the rest of the community, in order to reduce the isolation often imposed
by different institutional delivery systems acting within small geographical areas.

Introduction and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this program announcement is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds, authorized
under the Native American Programs Act (Act), as amended, to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency
for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American Pacific Islanders in four competitive
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to streamline the application process for eligible Native American applicants, ANA is issuing one program
announcement announcing fiscal year 1995 funds. Therefore, information regarding ANA's mission, policy, goals,
application requirements, review criteria and closing dates for each competitive area is now in one comprehensive
announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In previous years, the Administration for Native Americans promoted the goal of self-sufficiency in Native American
communities primarily through Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) projects. Amendments to the Native
American Programs Act have expanded ANA's granting authority to establish two additional programs for (1) environmental
regulatory enhancement, and (2) Native American languages preservation and enhancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects are awarded funds under sections 803(a), 803(d) and 803C of the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended
(Public Law 93&hyph;644, 88 Stat. 2324, 42 U.S.C. 2991b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;408) authorizes financial assistance
for projects to address environmental regulatory concerns (Section 803(d) of the Native American Programs Act of
1974, as amended).

The Native American Languages Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;524) authorizes financial assistance for projects
to promote the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages (Section 803C of the Native American
Programs Act of 1974, as amended). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program announcement is being issued in anticipation of the appropriation of funds for fiscal year 1995, and
the availability of funds for the four competitive areas is contingent upon sufficient final appropriations. Proposed
projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis against the evaluation criteria under each respective competitive
area in this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligible applicants may compete for and receive a grant award in each of the three competitive areas. However, ANA
continues its policy that an applicant may only submit one application per competitive area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
PART I_ANA POLICY AND GOALS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mission of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) is to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency
for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Native American Pacific Islanders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration for Native Americans believes that a Native American community is self-sufficient when it can
generate and control the resources necessary to meet its social and economic goals, and the needs of its members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration for Native Americans also believes that the responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency
resides with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and in the leadership of Native American
groups. A community's progress toward self-sufficiency is based on its efforts to plan, organize, and direct resources
in a comprehensive manner which is consistent with its established long-range goals.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration for Native Americans' policy is based on three interrelated goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Governance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assist tribal and village governments, Native American institutions, and local leadership to exercise local
control and decision-making over their resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Economic Development: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To foster the development of stable, diversified local economies and economic activities which will provide jobs
and promote economic well-being. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Social Development: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To support local access to, control of, and coordination of services and programs which safeguard the health, well-being
and culture of people, provide support services and training so people can work, and which are essential to a thriving
and self-sufficient community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration for Native Americans assists eligible applicants in the four competitive areas to undertake
one to three year development projects that are part of long-range comprehensive plans to move toward governance,
social, and/or economic self-sufficiency. For each type of project, applicants must describe a concrete locally-determined
strategy to carry out a proposed project with fundable objectives and activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local long-range planning must consider the maximum use of all available resources, how the resources will be directed
to development opportunities, and present a strategy for overcoming the local issues that hinder movement toward
self-sufficiency in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe
chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project
(e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the
project and the Tribe's understanding that the other applicant's project supplants the Tribe's authority to submit
an application under that specific competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
PART II_ANA COMPETITIVE AREAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The four competitive areas under this Part describe ANA's funding authorities, priorities, special initiatives,
requirements, and review criteria. However, most of the requirements are standard for all applications to be submitted
under this program announcement. The standard requirements necessary for each application, as well as standard
ANA program guidance and technical guidance are described in Part III of this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant may submit a separate application under any of the competitive areas described in this Part, as long as
the applicant meets the eligibility requirements that are listed separately under each area. Applications for SEDS
grants from Alaska Native entities may be submitted under either Competitive Area 1 or Competitive Area 2. An Alaska
Native entity may not submit an application under both Competitive Areas 1 and 2 for the same closing date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Purpose and Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 financial assistance
to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians,
and Native American Pacific Islanders through locally developed social and economic development strategies (SEDS).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately $14 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this priority area for governance,
social and economic development projects. In fiscal year 1995, ANA anticipates awarding approximately 120 competitive
grants ranging from $30,000 to $1,000,000 under this competitive area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To achieve its goals, ANA supports tribal and village 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments, and Native American organizations, in their efforts to develop and implement community-based, long-term
governance, social and economic development strategies (SEDS). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies must promote the goal of self-sufficiency in local communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SEDS approach is based on ANA's program goals and incorporates two fundamental principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The local community and its leadership are responsible for determining goals, setting priorities, and planning
and implementing programs aimed at achieving those goals. The local community is in the best position to apply its
own cultural, political, and socio-economic values to its long-term strategies and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Governance and social and economic development are interrelated. In order to move toward self-sufficiency, development
in one area should be balanced with development in the others. Consequently, comprehensive development strategies
should address all aspects of the governmental, economic, and social infrastructures needed to promote self-sufficient
communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANA's SEDS policy is based on the use of the following definitions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Governmental infrastructure'' includes the constitutional, legal, and administrative development
requisite for independent governance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Economic infrastructure'' includes the physical, commercial, industrial and/or agricultural components
necessary for a functioning local economy which supports the life-style embraced by the Native American community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Social infrastructure'' includes those components through which health, economic well-being and culture
are maintained within the community and that support governance and economic goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These definitions should be kept in mind as a local social and economic development strategy is developed as part of
a grant application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A community's movement toward self-sufficiency could be jeopardized if a careful balance between governmental,
economic and social development is not maintained. For example, expansion of social services, without providing
opportunities for employment and economic development, could lead to dependency on social services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, inadequate support services and training could seriously impede productivity and local economic development.
Additionally, the necessary infrastructures must be developed or expanded at the community level to support social
and economic development and growth. In designing their social and economic development strategies, ANA encourages
an applicant to use or leverage all available human, natural, financial, and physical resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussing their community-based, long-range goals, and the objectives for the proposed projects, ANA recommends
that non-Federally recognized and off-reservation groups include a description of what constitutes their specific
community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANA encourages the development and maintenance of comprehensive strategic plans which are an integral part of attaining
and supporting the balance necessary for successful activities that lead to self-sufficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides descriptions of activities which are consistent with the SEDS philosophy. Proposed activities
should be tailored to reflect the governance, social and economic development needs of the local community and should
be consistent and supportive of the proposed project objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The types of projects which ANA may fund include, but are not limited to, the following:

E. Grantee Share of the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we encourage applicants to secure non-Federal funds for their match, the non-Federal share may be satisfied
through other Federal funding sources, provided the other Federal program source relates to the proposed ANA project,
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indian Child Welfare funds, through the Department of Interior; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Community Development Block Grant funds, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications originating from American Samoa, Guam, Palau, or

F. Review Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposed project should reflect the purposes of ANA's SEDS policy and program goals (described in the Background
section of this competitive area), include a social and economic development strategy which reflects the needs and
specific circumstances of the local community, and address the specific developmental steps that the tribe or Native
American community is undertaking toward self-sufficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as a whole in judging the overall quality
of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this competitive area and these
criteria. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis using the following evaluation criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Long-range goals and available resources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (15 points) (a) The application explains how specific social, governance and economic long-range community goals
relate to the proposed project and strategy. It explains how the community intends to achieve these goals. It documents
the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning process and implementation of the proposed project.
The goals are described within the context of the applicant's comprehensive community social and economic development
plan. (Inclusion of the community's entire development plan is not necessary). The application has a clearly delineated
social and economic development strategy (SEDS).

(b) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist, and be coordinated with the
project are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources,
not merely letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed
project. Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity
of other resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature,
amount and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For
example, a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding
to complement proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources
may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements
that additional funding will be sought from other specific sources is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 considered a binding commitment of outside resources.

A. Purpose and Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for Alaska
Native social and economic development projects. Approximately $1.5 million of financial assistance is anticipated
to be available under this competitive area for Alaska Native governance, social and economic development projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANA plans to award approximately 15&hyph;18 grants under this competitive area. For individual village projects,
the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $100,000; for regional nonprofit and village consortia,
the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $150,000, commensurate with approved multi-village
objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the three ANA goals described in Part I, ANA implemented a special Alaska social and economic development
initiative in fiscal year 1984. This special effort was designed to provide financial assistance at the village level
or for village-specific projects aimed at improving a village's governance capabilities and for social and economic
development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This competitive area continues to implement this special initiative. ANA believes both the nonprofit and for-profit
corporations in Alaska can play an important supportive role in assisting individual villages to develop and implement
their own locally determined strategies which capitalize on opportunities afforded to Alaska Natives under the
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), Public Law 92&hyph;203. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core administration of an
organization. However, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity building projects at the village
government level if the village does not have governing systems in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we encourage applicants to secure non-Federal funds for their match, the non-Federal share may be satisfied
through other Federal funding sources, provided the source relates to the ANA project, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indian Child Welfare funds, through the Department of Interior;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance funds, through the Department of Interior and the Department
of Health and Human Services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Community Development Block Grant funds, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations.

(b) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist and be coordinated with the project
are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely
letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project.
Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other
resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount
and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For example,
a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding to complement
proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources may be human,
natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements that additional
funding will be sought from other specific sources is

A. Purpose and Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for environmental
regulatory enhancement projects. Approximately $3 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available
under this announcement for environmental regulatory enhancement projects. ANA expects to award approximately
35 grants under this competitive area. The funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite an increasing environmental responsibility and growing awareness of environmental issues on Indian lands,
there has been a lack of resources available to tribes to develop tribal environmental programs that are responsive
to tribal needs. In many cases, this lack of resources has resulted in a delay in action on the part of the tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the critical issues identified by tribes before Congressional committees include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The need for assistance to train professional staff to monitor and enforce tribal environmental programs;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The lack of adequate data for tribes to develop environmental statutes and establish environmental quality
standards; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The lack of resources to conduct studies to identify sources of pollution and the ability to determine the impact
on existing environmental quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, Congress enacted the Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;408)
to strengthen tribal governments through building capacity within the tribes in order to identify, plan, develop,
and implement environmental programs in a manner that is consistent with tribal culture. ANA is to support these activities
on a government-to-government basis in a way that recognizes tribal sovereignty and is consistent with tribal culture.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration for Native Americans believes that responsibility for achieving environmental regulatory
enhancement rests with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and with the leadership of
Native American groups.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Progress toward the goal of environmental regulatory enhancement would include the strengthening of tribal environmental
laws, providing for the training and education of those employees responsible for ensuring compliance with and enforcement
of these laws, and the development of programs to conduct compliance and enforcement functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other functions leading toward enhancing local regulatory capacity include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Environmental assessments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development and use of environmental laboratories; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Development of court systems for enforcement of tribal and Federal environmental laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimate success in this program will be realized when the applicant's desired level of environmental quality is
acquired and maintained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirement through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% of total project cost). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal share may be met by cash or through the provision of in-kind property or services, but only to the extent

staff and consultants should have the required qualifications and experience. The application should clearly describe
any previous or current activities of the applicant organization or proposed staff and/or consultants in support
of environmental regulatory enhancement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Congress has recognized that the history of past policies of the United States toward Indian and other Native American
languages has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of Native American languages that have survived over the
past five hundred years. Consequently, the Native American Languages Act was enacted (Title I, Public Law 101&hyph;477)
to address this decline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This legislation invested the United States government with the responsibility to work together with Native Americans
to ensure the survival of cultures and languages unique to Native America. This law declared that it is the policy of
the United States to ``preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice,
and develop Native American languages.'' While the Congress made a significant first step in passing this legislation
in 1990, it served only as a declaration of policy. No program initiatives were proposed, nor any funds authorized
to enact any significant programs in furtherance of this policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, Congressional testimony provided estimates that of the several hundred languages that once existed, only
about one hundred and fifty-five (155) languages are still spoken or remembered today. However, only 20 are spoken
by persons of all ages, 30 are spoken by adults of all ages, about 60 are spoken by middle-aged adults, and 45 are spoken
only by the most elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this testimony, the Congress passed the Native American Languages Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;524)
to assist Native Americans in assuring the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. Passage of this law
is an important second step in attempting to ensure the survival and continuation of Native American languages, as
it provides the basic foundation upon which the Tribal nations can rebuild their economic strength and rich cultural
diversity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Federal government recognizes that substantial loss of Native American languages has occurred over the
past several hundred years, the nature and magnitude of the status of Native American languages will be better defined
when eligible applicants have completed language assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) believes that responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency rests
with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and in the leadership of Native American groups.
This belief supports the ANA principle that the local community and its leadership are responsible for determining
goals, setting priorities, and planning and implementing programs which support the community's long range goals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, since preserving a language and ensuring its continuation is generally one of the first steps taken toward
strengthening a group's identity, activities proposed under this program announcement will contribute to the social
development of a native community and significantly contribute to its path toward self-sufficiency.

The Administration for Native Americans recognizes that eligible applicants must have the opportunity to develop
their own language plans, technical capabilities and access to the necessary financial and technical resources
in order to assess, plan, develop and implement programs to assure the survival and continuing vitality of their languages.
ANA also recognizes that potential applicants may have specialized knowledge and capabilities to address specific
language concerns at various levels. This competitive area reflects these special needs and circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proof of an applicant's nonprofit status, such as an IRS determination of nonprofit status under IRS Code 501(c)(3),
must be included in the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe
chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project
(e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the

E. Grantee Share of the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal share may include funds distributed to a tribe, including interest, by the Federal government: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Pursuant to the satisfaction of a claim made under Federal law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;From funds collected and administered on behalf of such tribe or its constituent members; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For general tribal administration or tribal development under a formula or subject to a tribal budgeting priority
system, such as, but not limited to, funds involved in the settlement of land or other judgment claims, severance or
other royalty payments, or payments under the Indian Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.) or tribal budget
priority system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications submitted as a partnership arrangement with a school, college, or university, may use contributions
from the ``partner'' organization(s) to meet the non-Federal share, as appropriate. Applications originating
from American Samoa, Guam, Palau, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are covered under section 501(d)
of Public Law 95&hyph;134, as amended (48 U.S.C. 1469a) under which HHS waives any requirement for local matching
funds under $200,000 (including in-kind contributions).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The application explains how the community and existing tribal government (where one exists) intends to achieve
these goals. It clearly documents the involvement and support of the community members in the planning process and
implementation of the proposed project as appropriate (e.g., tribal resolutions, minutes of Community meetings,
etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist and be coordinated with the project
are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely
letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project.
Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other
resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount
and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. These resources
may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements
that additional funding will be sought from other specific sources is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

PART III_GENERAL APPLICATION INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding areas in this program announcement are based on the following definitions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
multi-purpose community-based Native American organization
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is an association and/or corporation whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charter specifies that the community designates the Board of Directors and/or officers of the organization through
an elective procedure and that the organization functions in several different areas of concern to the members of
the local Native American community. These areas are specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the by-laws and/or policies adopted by the organization. They may include, but need not be limited to, economic,
artistic, cultural, and recreational activities, and the delivery of human services such as health care, day care,
counseling, education, and training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
multi-year project
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a project on a single theme that requires more than 12 months to complete and affords the applicant an opportunity
to develop and address more complex and in-depth strategies than can be completed in one year. A multi-year project
cannot be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or three year
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Core administration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is funding for staff salaries for those functions which support the organization as a whole, or for purposes unrelated
to the actual management or implementation of work conducted under an ANA approved project.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental regulatory enhancement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 encompasses (but is not limited to) the planning, development, and application of laws, training, monitoring, and
enforcement procedures, tribal courts, environmental laboratories and other facilities, and associated regulatory
activities to strengthen the tribal government's capacity to enhance the quality of reservation life as measured
by the reduction of pollutants in the air, water, soil, food and materials encountered by inhabitants of tribes and
villages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Language preservation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the maintenance of a language so that it will not decline to non-use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Language vitality'' is the active use of a language in a wide range of domains of human life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Language replication
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is defined as the application of a language program model developed in one community to other linguistically similar
communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Language survival is defined as the maintenance and continuation of language from one generation to another
in a wide range of aspects of community life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-ANA resources should be leveraged to strengthen and broaden the impact of the proposed project in the community.
Project designs should explain how those parts of projects which ANA does not fund will be financed through other sources.
For example, ANA does not fund construction. Applicants must show the relationship of non-ANA funded activities
to those objectives and activities that are funded with ANA grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs of fundraising, including financial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and
similar expenses incurred solely to raise capital or obtain contributions are unallowable under a grant award. However,
even though these costs are unallowable for purposes of computing charges to Federal awards, they must be treated
as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect cost rates and be allocated their share of the organization's
indirect costs if they represent activities which (1) include the salaries of personnel, (2) occupy space, and (3)
benefit from the organization's indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All projects funded by ANA must be completed, or self-sustaining or supported with other than ANA funds at the end of
the project period. ``Completed'' means that the project ANA funded is finished, and the desired result(s) have been
attained. ``Self-sustaining'' means that a project will continue without outside resources. ``Supported by other
than ANA funds'' means that the project will continue beyond the ANA project period, but will be supported by funds
other than ANA's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Activities That Cannot Be Funded By ANA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration for Native Americans does not fund projects that operate indefinitely or require ANA funding
on a recurring basis. The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core
administration of an organization. Under Competitive Area 2, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity
building projects at the village government level if the village does not have governing systems in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, functions and activities that are clearly project related are eligible for grant funding. For example,
the management and administrative functions necessary to carry out an ANA approved project are not considered ``core
administration'' and are, therefore, eligible costs. Additionally, ANA will fund the salaries of approved staff
for time actually and reasonably spent to implement a funded ANA project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects or activities that generally will not meet the purposes of this announcement are discussed further in Part
III, Section H, General Guidance to Applicants, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Multi-Year Projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants may apply for projects of up to three years. A multi-year project is a project on a single theme that requires
more than 12 months to complete and affords the applicant an opportunity to develop and address more complex and in-depth
strategies than can be completed in one year. Applicants are encouraged to develop multi-year projects. A multi-year
project cannot be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or
three year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for three years.
Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period, but within the
three-year project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability
of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and determination that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government. Therefore, this program announcement does not
apply to current ANA grantees with multi-year projects that apply for continuation funding for their second or third
year budget periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

Program statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each tribe, Native American organization, or other eligible applicant may compete and receive a grant award in each
of the three competitive areas under this announcement. The Administration for Native Americans will accept only
one application per competitive area from any one applicant. Alaska Native entities may submit a SEDS application
under either competitive area 1 or 2, but not under both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an eligible applicant sends in two applications for the same competitive area, the one with the earlier postmark
will be accepted for review unless the applicant withdraws the earlier application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Application Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans determines the final action to be taken on each grant
application received under this program announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following points should be taken into consideration by all applicants: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incomplete applications and applications that do not conform to this announcement will not be accepted for
review. Applicants will be notified in writing of any such determination by ANA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Complete applications that conform to all the requirements of this program announcement are subjected to
a competitive review and evaluation process (discussed in section G below). Independent review panels consisting
of reviewers familiar with (1) American Indian Tribes and Native American communities and organizations, (2) environmental
issues, and (3) Native American languages, as appropriate, evaluates each application using the published criteria
in each funding competitive area. As a result of the review, a numerical score will be assigned to each application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Commissioner's funding decision is based on the review panel's analysis of the application, recommendation
and comments of ANA staff, State and Federal agencies having contract and grant performance related information,
and other interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Commissioner makes grant awards consistent with the purpose of the Act, all relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements, this program announcement, and the availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After the Commissioner has made decisions on all applications, unsuccessful applicants are notified in writing
within approximately 120 days of the closing date. The notification will be accompanied by a critique including recommendations
for improving the application. Successful applicants are notified through an official Financial Assistance Award
(FAA) document. The Administration for Native Americans staff cannot respond to requests for information regarding
funding decisions prior to the official notification to the applicants. The FAA will state the amount of Federal funds
awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award, the
project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-ACF matching share requirement.

G. The Review Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Initial Application Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications submitted by the closing date and verified by the postmark under this program announcement will undergo
a pre-review to determine that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The applicant is eligible in accordance with the Eligible Applicants Section of this announcement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The application narrative, forms and materials submitted are adequate to allow the review panel to undertake
an in depth evaluation. (All required materials and forms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist in the Application
Kit). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Competitive Review of Accepted Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by an independent review panel on the basis of the
specific evaluation criteria listed in Part II. These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project,
and to determine the likelihood of its success.

3. Determination of Ineligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants who are initially rejected from competitive evaluation because of ineligibility, may appeal an ANA decision
of applicant ineligibility. Likewise, applicants may also appeal an ANA decision that an applicant's proposed activities
are ineligible for funding consideration. Section 810(b) of the Native American Programs Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
2991h, specifies the appeals process when ANA determines that an organization or activities are ineligible for assistance.
When an applicant or the activities proposed by the applicant are rejected as ineligible, the applicant will be advised
of the appropriate appeal process.

H. General Guidance to Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following information is provided to assist applicants in developing a competitive application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Program Guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans funds projects that demonstrate the strongest prospects for addressing
the stated purposes of this program announcement. Projects will not be funded on the basis of need alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In discussing the goals, strategy, and problems being addressed in the application, include sufficient background
and/or history of the community concerning these issues and/or progress to date, as well as the size of the population
to be served. This material will assist the reviewers in determining the appropriateness and potential benefits
of the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the discussion of community-based, long-range goals, non-Federally recognized and off-reservations
groups are encouraged to include a description of what constitutes their specific ``community.'' In addition, applicants
should document the community's support for the proposed project and explain the role of the community in the planning
process and implementation of the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applications from National Indian and Native organizations must demonstrate a need for the project, explain
how the project was originated, state who the intended beneficiaries will be, and describe how the recipients will
actually benefit from the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An application should describe a clear relationship between the proposed project, the social and economic
development strategy, or environmental or language goals, as appropriate, and the community's long-range goals
or plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The project application must clearly identify in measurable terms the expected results, benefits or outcomes
of the proposed project, and the positive or continuing impact that the project will have on the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Supporting documentation, if available, or other testimonies from concerned interests other than the applicant
should be included to demonstrate support for the feasibility of the project and the commitment of other resources
to the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the ANA Project Narrative, Section A of the application package, Resources Available to the Proposed Project,
the applicant should describe any specific financial circumstances which may impact on the project, such as any monetary
or land settlements made to the applicant, and any restrictions on the use of those settlements. When the applicant
appears to have other resources to support the proposed project and chooses not to use them, the applicant should explain
why it is seeking ANA funds and not utilizing these resources for the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reviewers of applications for ANA indicate they are better able to evaluate whether the feasibility has been
addressed and the practicality of a proposed economic development project, or a new business, if the applicant includes
a business plan that clearly describes its feasibility and the approach for the implementation and marketing of the
business. (ANA has included sample business plans in the application kit). It is strongly recommended that an applicant
use these materials as guides in developing a proposal for an economic development project or business that is part
of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Technical Guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;It is strongly suggested that the applicant follow the Supplemental Guide included in the ANA application
kit to develop an application. The Guide provides practical information and helpful suggestions, and is an aid to
help applicants prepare ANA applications for social and economic development projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants are encouraged to have someone other than the author apply the evaluation criteria in the program
announcement and score the application prior to its submission, in order to gain a better sense of the application's
quality and potential competitiveness in the ANA review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In Competitive Area 1 there is no maximum or minimum amount of Federal funds that may be requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For purposes of developing an application, applicants should plan for a project start date approximately
120 days after the closing date under which the application is submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans will not fund essentially identical projects serving the same constituency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a project could be supported by other Federal funding sources, the applicant should fully explain its reasons
for not pursuing other Federal funds for the project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit proposals addressing environmental regulatory enhancement
and Native American languages preservation and enhancement under the issue-specific competitive areas described
in this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For purposes of this announcement, ANA is using the Bureau of Indian Affairs' list of federally recognized
Indian Tribes which includes nonprofit Alaska Native community entities or tribal governing bodies (IRA or traditional
councils). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans will accept only one application, per competitive area, from any
one applicant. If an eligible applicant sends in two applications for the same competitive area, the one with the earlier
postmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant withdraws the earlier application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An application from a federally recognized Tribe, Alaska Native Village or Native American organization
must be from the governing body of the Tribe or organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If
a Tribe chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's
project (e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. In this case, the applicant must include
a tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the project and the Tribe's understanding
that the other applicant's project supplants the Tribe's authority to submit an application under that specific
competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The application's Form 424 must be signed by the applicant's representative authorized to act with full authority
on behalf of the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans recommends that the pages of the application be numbered sequentially
and that a table of contents be provided. Simple tabbing of the sections of the application is also helpful to the reviewers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Two copies of the application plus the original are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Cover Page (included in the Kit) should be the first page of an application, followed by the one-page abstract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Approach page (Section B of the ANA Program Narrative) for each Objective Work Plan proposed should be of
sufficient detail to become a monthly staff guide for project responsibilities if the applicant is funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The applicant should specify the entire project period length on the first page of the Form 424, Block 13, not
the length of the first budget period. Should the application's contents propose one length of project period and
the Form 424 specify a conflicting length of project period, ANA will consider the project period specified on the
Form 424 as governing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Line 15a of the 424 must specify the Federal funds requested for the first Budget Period, not the entire project
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a profit-making venture is being proposed, profits must be reinvested in the business in order to decrease
or eliminate ANA's future participation. Such revenue must be reported as general program income. A decision will
be made at the time of grant award regarding appropriate use of program income. (See 45 CFR Part 74 and Part 92.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants may propose a 17 month project period. However, the project period for the first year of a multi-year
project may only be 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants proposing multi-year projects must fully describe each year's project objectives and activities.
Separate Objective Work Plans (OWPs) must be presented for each project year and a separate itemized budget of the
Federal and non-Federal costs of the project for each budget period must be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants for multi-year projects must justify the entire time-frame of the project (i.e., why the project
needs funding for more than one year) and clearly describe the results to be achieved for each objective by the end of
each budget period of the total project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans will critically evaluate applications in which the acquisition
of major capital equipment (i.e., oil rigs, agricultural equipment, etc.) is a major component of the Federal share
of the budget. During negotiation, such expenditures may be deleted from the budget of an otherwise approved application,
if not fully justified by the applicant and not deemed appropriate to the needs of the project by ANA.

3. Projects or Activities That Generally Will Not Meet the Purposes of This Announcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Projects in which a grantee would provide training and/or technical assistance (T/TA) to other tribes or Native
American organizations which are otherwise eligible to apply to ANA (``third party T/TA''). However, the purchase
of T/TA by a grantee for its own use or for its members' use (as in the case of a consortium), where T/TA is necessary to
carry out project objectives, is acceptable. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
T/TA is an allowable activity for environmental regulatory enhancement projects submitted under Competitive Area
3, and Native American languages projects submitted under Competitive Area 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Projects that request funds for feasibility studies, business plans, marketing plans or written materials,
such as manuals, that are not an essential part of the applicant's long-range development plan. As an objective of
a larger project, business plans are allowable. However, ANA is not interested in funding ``wish lists'' of business
possibilities. ANA expects written evidence of the solid investment of time and consideration on the part of the applicant
with regard to the development of business plans. Business plans should be developed based on market analysis and
feasibility studies regarding the potential success to the business prior to the submission of the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The support of on-going social service delivery programs or the expansion, or continuation, of existing social
service delivery programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Core administration functions, or other activities, which essentially support only the applicant's on-going
administrative functions. However, under Competitive Area 2, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity
building projects at the village government level if the village does not have governing systems in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Project goals which are not responsive to one or more of the funding competitive areas.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Proposals from consortia of tribes that are not specific with regard to support from, and roles of, member tribes.
ANA expects an application from a consortium to have goals and objectives that will create positive impacts and outcomes
in the communities of its members. In situations where both a consortia of tribes and the tribes who belong to the consortia
receive ANA funding, ANA expects that consortia groups will not seek funding that duplicates activities being conducted
by their member tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Projects that will not be completed, self-sustaining, or supported by other than ANA funds, at the end of the
project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The purchase of real estate (see 45 CFR 1336.50 (e)) or construction (see ACF Grants Administration Manual
Ch. 3, Section E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Projects originated and designed by consultants who provide a major role for themselves in the proposed project
and are not members of the applicant organization, tribe or village.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration for Children and Families may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such
as floods, hurricanes, etc., or when there is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if ACF does not extend
the deadline for all applicants, it may not waive or extend the deadline for any applicant.
