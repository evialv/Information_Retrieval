<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to improve the licensing environment for advanced nuclear power
reactors to minimize complexity and uncertainty in the regulatory process. This statement gives the Commission's
policy regarding the review of, and desired characteristics associated with, advanced reactors. This policy statement
is a revision of the final policy statement titled ``Regulation of Advanced Nuclear Power Plants, Statement of Policy''
that was published on July 8, 1986. The purpose of this revision is to update the Commission's policy statement on advanced
reactors to reference the Commission's metrication policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 8, 1986 (51 FR 24643), the Commission published its final policy statement on advanced reactors in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission's primary objectives in issuing the advanced reactor policy statement were threefold:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;First, to maintain the earliest possible interaction of applicants, vendors, and government agencies, with
the NRC;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Second, to provide all interested parties, including the public, with the Commission's views concerning
the desired characteristics of advanced reactor designs; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Third, to express the Commission's intent to issue timely comment on the implications of such designs for safety
and the regulatory process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 10, 1988, Congress passed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act [the Act], (19 U.S.C. 2901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, (15 U.S.C. 205a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Section 5164 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 205a) designates the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures
for U.S. trade and commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to effect an orderly change to the metric system, the Act requires that all Federal agencies convert to
the metric system of measurement in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end
of fiscal year 1992, ``except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies
or loss of markets to U.S. firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric
units,'' Section 5614(b)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Act, the NRC published its metrication policy statement for comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 10, 1992 (57 FR 4891). The purpose of the metrication policy statement was to inform NRC licensees and the
public how the Commission intended to meet its obligations under the Act. Comments on the draft statement were submitted
by 12 responders, including 5 power reactor licensees, 3 standards organizations, a reactor vendor, a materials
licensee, the Nuclear Management and Resources Council, and a joint letter submitted by three individuals. All commenters
supported the Commission's position and the final policy statement was published on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46202).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission supports and encourages the use of the metric system of measurement by NRC licensees and applicants.
However, Commission experience to date in design certification reviews is that it is impracticable and uneconomical
to convert a design to the metric system late in the design process and that applicants should consider metrication
early in the design process. Therefore, the Commission is revising the advanced reactor policy statement to incorporate
its policy on metrication to encourage licensees and license applicants to employ the metric system of measurement
wherever and whenever its use is not potentially detrimental to the public health and safety or is not economically
impracticable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Commission Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with its legislative mandate, the Commission's policy with respect to regulating nuclear power reactors
is to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety and the environment. Regarding advanced reactors,
the Commission expects, as a minimum, at least the same degree of protection of the public and the environment that
is required for current-generation light water reactors. Furthermore, the Commission expects that advanced reactors
will provide enhanced margins of safety and/or utilize simplified, inherent, passive, or other innovative means
to accomplish their safety functions. The Commission also expects that advanced reactor designs will comply with
the Commission's safety goal policy statement and the policy statement on conversion to the metric system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the attributes that could assist in establishing the acceptability or licensability of a proposed advanced
reactor design, and that therefore should be considered in advanced designs, are:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Highly reliable and less complex shutdown and decay heat removal systems. The use of inherent or passive means
to accomplish this objective is encouraged (negative temperature coefficient, natural circulation, etc.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Longer time constants and sufficient instrumentation to allow for more diagnosis and management before reaching
safety systems challenge and/or exposure of vital equipment to adverse conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Simplified safety systems that, where possible, reduce required operator actions, equipment subjected
to severe environmental conditions, and components needed for maintaining safe shutdown conditions. Such simplified
systems should facilitate operator comprehension, reliable system function, and more straightforward engineering
analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that minimize the potential for severe accidents and their consequences by providing sufficient
inherent safety, reliability, redundancy, diversity, and independence in safety systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that provide reliable equipment in the balance of plant (BOP) (or safety-system independence from
BOP) to reduce the number of challenges to safety systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that provide easily maintainable equipment and components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that reduce potential radiation exposures to plant personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Designs that incorporate defense-in-depth philosophy by maintaining multiple barriers against radiation
release, and by reducing the potential for and consequences of severe accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Design features that can be proven by citation of existing technology or that can be satisfactorily established
by commitment to a suitable technology development program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If specific advanced reactor designs with some or all of the above foregoing attributes are brought to the NRC for comment
and/or evaluation, the Commission can develop preliminary design safety evaluation and licensing criteria for
their safety-related aspects. Combination of some or all of the above attributes may help obtain early licensing
approval with minimum regulatory burden. Designs with some or all of these attributes are also likely to be more readily
understood by the general public. Indeed, the number and nature of the regulatory requirements may depend on the extent
to which an individual advanced reactor design incorporates general attributes such as those listed above. However,
until such time as conceptual designs are submitted, the Commission believes that regulatory guidance must be sufficiently
general to avoid placing unnecessary constraints on the development of new design concepts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for more timely and effective regulation of advanced reactors, the Commission encourages the earliest
possible interaction of applicants, vendors, other government agencies, and the NRC to provide for early identification
of regulatory requirements for advanced reactors, and to provide all interested parties, including the public,
with a timely, independent assessment of the safety characteristics of advanced reactor designs. Such licensing
interaction and guidance early in the design process will contribute toward minimizing complexity and adding stability
and predictability in the licensing and regulation of advanced reactors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the NRC itself does not develop new designs, the Commission intends to develop the capability for timely assessment
and response to innovative and advanced designs that might be presented for NRC review. Prior experience has shown
that new reactor designs_even variations of established designs_may involve technical problems that must be solved
in order to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety. The earlier such design problems are identified,
the earlier satisfactory resolution can be achieved. Prospective applicants are reminded that, while the NRC will
undertake to review and comment on new design concepts, the applicants are responsible for documentation and research
necessary to support a specific license application. (NRC research is conducted to provide the technical bases for
rulemaking and regulatory decisions, to support licensing and inspection activities, and to increase NRC's understanding
of phenomena for which analytical methods are needed in regulatory activities.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the initial phase of advanced reactor development, the Commission particularly encourages design innovations
that enhance safety and reliability (such as those described above) and that generally depend on technology that
is either proven or can be demonstrated by a straightforward technology development program. In the absence of a significant
history of operating experience on an advanced concept reactor, plans for innovative use of proven technology and/or
new technology development programs should be presented to the NRC for review as early as possible, so that the NRC
can assess how the proposed program might influence regulatory requirements. To achieve these broad objectives,
the Advanced Reactor Projects Directorate (PDAR) was established in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. This
group is the focal point for NRC interaction with the Department of Energy, reactor designers, and potential applicants,
and coordinates the development of regulatory criteria and guidance for proposed advanced reactors. In addition,
the group maintains knowledge of advanced reactor designs, developments, and operating experience in other countries,
and provides guidance on an NRC-funded advanced reactor safety research program to ensure that it supports, and is
consistent with, the Commission's advanced reactor policy. The PDAR also provides guidance regarding the timing
and format of submittals for review. The Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards plays a significant role in reviewing
proposed advanced design concepts and supporting activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC believes that conversion to the metric system is important to the national interest. The Commission strongly
encourages its licensees and license applicants to employ the metric system of measurement wherever and whenever
its use is not potentially detrimental to the public health and safety or is not economically infeasible. In order
to facilitate use of the metric system by licensees and applicants, the NRC began publishing, as of January 7, 1993,
the following documents in dual units: new regulations, major amendments to existing regulations, regulatory guides,
NUREG-series documents, policy statements, information notices, generic letters, bulletins, and all written
communications directed to the public. Licensees and applicants should follow the guidance outlined in the Commission's
position and final policy statement on metrication published on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46202).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563, the Commission adopted a final rule establishing standards governing the electronic dissemination
of information relating to transportation of natural gas. The standards generally reflected consensus agreements
reached by industry Working Groups composed of members from all facets of the gas industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties had proposed to include in the standards an electronic Index of Purchasers which would disclose certain information
about the capacity rights of shippers on pipelines. The Working Groups, however, were unable to reach consensus on
an approach, and a number of participants submitted alternative approaches. One proposal, supported by 44 participants,
was to replace some of the Commission's reporting requirements relating to firm and interruptible transportation
with an electronic Index composed of nine data elements, available in downloadable form.

The proposal would replace the Commission's initial and subsequent reports (but not the annual reports and bypass
reports) and the requirement to include an Index of Purchasers in pipeline tariffs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission found that this proposal had significant merit because it would provide useful
information to the market about capacity, while setting the stage for reducing filing burdens and streamlining the
Commission's reporting requirements. The Commission expressed interest in pursuing this proposal further and
instructed Commission staff to work with the industry Working Groups to develop a final proposal by September 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANR contends the Commission's order is not clear on whether the Index of Purchasers will be adopted upon the submission
of the September 30, 1994 report, without an opportunity for further comment. It argues that the Commission should
clarify whether this proposal is still open for discussion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, ANR questions whether the Index of Purchasers is needed to promote the Commission's capacity release
objectives. It agrees that such an Index does offer the advantage of reducing reporting and tariff requirements,
but maintains that, if the Commission adopts the Index for that reason, it should do so only if it concomitantly eliminates
the other reporting requirements. Finally, ANR argues that if the Commission requires information not covered by
the existing reporting requirements, the Commission must justify the inclusion of such information. In particular,
ANR contends the Commission should not require dissemination of competitively sensitive information.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission denies ANR's request that the Commission clarify that pipelines will not have to adopt the Index of
Purchasers and ANR's alternative request for rehearing. ANR's requests at this point are premature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Order No. 563&hyph;A, the Commission only expressed interest in pursuing the Index of Purchasers proposal, but
did not make a final determination on the issue. After receiving the September 30, 1994 report from the Working Group,
the Commission will evaluate the proposal and determine how best to proceed. As the Commission stated in Order No.
563&hyph;A, the Commission will comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and will provide notice and an opportunity
for comment prior to making any changes or revisions to the standards.

This document amends Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations concerning diseases subject
to presumptive service connection in former prisoners of war by stating that the statutory term ``beriberi heart
disease'' includes ischemic heart disease in former prisoners of war who had experienced localized edema during
captivity. The effect of this amendment is to broaden VA's interpretation of that term based upon new epidemiological
evidence.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1970, Congress passed Public Law 91&hyph;376, &sect;3, 84 Stat. 787, 788 (1970), which established a presumption
of service connection for seven categories of diseases and conditions, including ``beriberi (including beriberi
heart disease),'' developing to a ten-percent degree of disability at any time after active service in the case of
a veteran held as a prisoner of war in World War II, the Korean Conflict, or the Vietnam War who suffered from dietary
deficiencies, forced labor, or inhumane treatment in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The intent of Congress
was to recognize diseases suffered by former prisoners of war during captivity for which there is no medical documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern remained, however, as to the problems encountered by these veterans in their efforts to prove service connection
for disabilities attributable to the conditions of their capture and imprisonment. Some claimed that their ability
to prove service connection for disabilities was hampered because there are inadequate medical records and that
certain disabilities which were considered to be minor at the time of release from service were becoming more serious.
Congress therefore enacted the Former Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 1981, Public Law 97&hyph;37, 95 Stat. 935, which
eliminated the requirement that former prisoners of war must have suffered from dietary deficiencies, forced labor,
or inhumane treatment during confinement in order to qualify for the presumption of service connection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Early thiamine deficiency is characterized
by anorexia, irritability, and weight loss. Later, patients experience weakness, peripheral neuropathy, headache,
and tachycardia. Advanced thiamine deficiency presents with involvement of two major organ systems predominantly:
the cardiovascular system (the syndrome known as ``wet beriberi,'' i.e., beriberi heart disease) and the nervous
system, both central and peripheral (known as ``dry beriberi'').

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the Medical Follow-up Agency of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, issued a study entitled
``The Health of Former Prisoners of War'' which reported the results of a medical examination survey of former World
War II and Korean Conflict POWs and comparable control groups. That study found what it termed a noteworthy association
between ischemic heart disease and earlier reporting of localized edema of feet, ankles and legs_presumably due
to beriberi heart disease (wet beriberi)_while in captivity. While there is no known satisfactory explanatory biological
mechanism linking beriberi or malnutrition and subsequent chronic heart disease, the examination data from the
current study provides epidemiological evidence to suggest there is a connection between conditions during captivity
and the later development of ischemic heart disease. According to the study, the reporting of edema in prison camp
indicates a specific nutritional deficiency, beriberi, and the location of edema in the feet, ankles and legs is presumably
related to beriberi heart disease in prison camp which is caused by thiamine deficiency.

After reviewing this study the Secretary has determined, in keeping with the intent of Congress to provide a presumption
of service connection for former prisoners of war who have diseases which result from dietary inadequacies or unsanitary
conditions and for which service connection may be difficult to establish, that the term beriberi heart disease found
at 38 U.S.C. 1112(b)(2) includes ischemic heart disease if the former prisoner of war suffered localized edema during

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA's hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations do not apply to steel pipelines that operate at 20 percent or
less of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS). This final rule extends the regulations to three groups of these
pipelines: pipelines that transport highly volatile liquids, pipelines or pipeline segments in populated areas,
and pipelines or pipeline segments in navigable waterways. Accidents have shown that regulating these pipelines
or pipeline segments would be in the interest of public safety. Moreover, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 provides
that DOT may not exclude hazardous liquid pipelines from regulation based solely on operation at low internal stress.
The final rule responds to this statutory prohibition and will reduce the risk that hazardous liquid pipelines present
to public safety and the environment.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA's hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations do not apply to pipelines operating at a stress level of 20 percent
or less of SMYS (hereafter ``low-stress pipelines'') (see 49 CFR 195.1(b)(3)). DOT excluded these pipelines from
part 195 when it first issued the regulations (34 FR 15473; October 4, 1969). However, serious accidents have occurred
on low-stress pipelines, suggesting that this blanket exclusion is no longer in the interest of public safety. Moreover,
Section 206 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (PSA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508; October 24, 1992), amended &sect;203(b)
of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) (49 App. U.S.C. 2002(b)) to provide that ``[i]n exercising
any discretion under this Act, the Secretary shall not provide an exception to regulation under this Act for any pipeline
facility solely on the basis of the fact that such pipeline facility operates at low internal stress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 31, 1990, RSPA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on low-stress pipelines (55 FR 45822).
The notice described accidents and rulemaking recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We analyzed data received in response to that notice to learn the benefits and costs of regulating low-stress pipelines.
The analysis showed that many operators could face costs disproportionate to benefits if RSPA regulated all low-stress
pipelines subject to the HLPSA. So we focused on those low-stress pipelines that pose a higher risk to people and the
environment. We identified the commodity in transportation and the location of the pipeline as significant risk
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA then published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 12213; March 3, 1993) that addressed these risk factors.
The NPRM proposed to apply the safety standards in part 195 and the drug testing rules in 49 CFR part 199 to low-stress
pipelines that transport highly volatile liquids (HVL), traverse populated areas, or traverse navigable waterways.
These pipelines were targeted because failures of HVL pipelines usually result in more deaths and injuries than other
pipeline failures, and failures in populated areas and navigable waterways generally result in more damages to people
and the environment. Furthermore, the risk of outside force damage, a major cause of pipeline accidents, is greater
in populated areas and navigable waterways, making failures there somewhat more likely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules would address the statutory restriction (quoted above) on administrative discretion in regulating
hazardous liquid pipelines. The proposed rules also would respond to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380),
which requires DOT to regulate oil pipelines to prevent pollution of navigable waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed regulating four kinds of pipelines operating at 20 percent or less of SMYS: gathering lines, trunk
lines, inter-facility lines, and delivery lines. Unaffected were pipelines that part 195 does not cover for a reason
besides low operating stress. For example, the NPRM did not propose regulating low-stress rural gathering lines.
Part 195 does not apply to petroleum gathering lines in rural areas, regardless of the pipeline's operating stress
level (see &sect;195.1(b)(4)). Also, with regard to low-stress pipelines that do not transport HVL, the proposed
rules did not affect pipelines or pipeline segments that lie outside populated areas or navigable waterways. However,
controls or equipment on excepted segments that are necessary for the safe operation of pipeline segments inside
populated areas or navigable waterways (e.g., pressure controls) would have to meet part 195 requirements.

II. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the preamble summarizes and discusses the major written comments RSPA received on the proposed rules.
Comments related to the draft economic evaluation of costs and benefits are discussed in the Final Regulatory Evaluation,
which is in the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Extent and Nature of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comments by May 3, 1993. RSPA received 13 written comments. The comments came from seven pipeline
operators, one pipeline trade association (the American Petroleum Institute (API)), three state pipeline safety
agencies, one federal agency (the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)), and one public interest organization
(the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB, two state agencies, and one operator voiced general support for the NPRM. The rest of the commenters directed
their remarks to specific issues. Those issues are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Rural Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NRDC and a state agency suggested that RSPA should not continue to except non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural areas
from part 195. These commenters argued that people and the environment in rural areas deserve the same protection
as people and the environment in populated areas. They also said that serious accidents have occurred in rural areas,
and that low stress is not necessarily an indicator of low risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RSPA appreciates these commenters' concerns, we have decided not to expand the present rulemaking to include
the regulation of additional low-stress pipelines in rural areas. However, the need to regulate rural low-stress
pipelines not covered by the present rulemaking will be considered in upcoming proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from production lines (which are not subject to the HLPSA), most low-stress pipelines in rural areas probably
are gathering lines. Until passage of the PSA, rural gathering lines were not subject to regulation under the HLPSA.
However, the PSA enlarged RSPA's regulatory authority under the HLPSA to include, with certain exceptions, those
rural gathering lines that warrant regulation based on location and other risk factors. As required by Section 208
of the PSA, RSPA will consider regulation of those lines in a future notice of proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we will consider the need to regulate rural low-stress pipelines that are not gathering lines principally
on the basis of the risk the low-stress lines pose to the environment. Through response planning in cooperation with
other federal and state agencies under the Oil Pollution Act, we are developing a better concept of what constitutes
an environmentally-sensitive area for purposes of pipeline environmental regulation. This planning should provide
the groundwork both for the future notice of proposed rulemaking on rural gathering lines and for a rulemaking on other
rural low-stress pipelines.

D. Adequacy of NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
API commented on the impact of the proposed rules on inter-facility lines and delivery lines. It said the proposed
rules would significantly affect non-pipeline companies, such as refineries, petrochemical plants, and terminals.
But, according to API, these companies may not have been aware of the NPRM. API advised RSPA to publish a separate NPRM
directed at inter-facility and delivery lines, with at least a 6-month comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that another rulemaking notice is needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The published NPRM clearly discussed the proposed applicability of part 195 to inter-facility lines and delivery
lines. The NPRM gave all interested persons, including non-pipeline companies, an adequate opportunity to comment
on the proposed extension of part 195 to cover these low-stress pipelines. In addition, some non-pipeline companies
were aware of the NPRM, because representatives of refineries submitted comments. Other non-pipeline companies
should have been aware that RSPA was considering the need to regulate low-stress pipelines. As stated above, RSPA
published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on low-stress pipelines. Also, we specifically invited representatives
of the chemical, refining, and terminal industries to attend a meeting on low-stress pipelines (56 FR 23538; May 22,
1991). At that meeting, RSPA staff described all low-stress pipelines excluded from part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Economically Marginal Gathering Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comment on whether economically marginal gathering lines (i.e., lines which have little profit)
in populated areas should receive separate treatment under the final rules. One operator wanted to exclude from regulation
petroleum gathering lines that operate at less than 5 percent of SMYS and transport mostly sediment and water. The
operator said these lines present little or no risk, but the cost of regulation would be high because of the large number
of lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API and an operator said many low-stress pipelines in populated areas are associated with mature wells of diminishing
production. These commenters argued regulation would accelerate the marginal economic status of the lines. They
also suggested that more truck transportation would follow, with greater risk to the public. The operator particularly
asked RSPA not to regulate low-stress pipelines transporting crude oil that has a high flash point. These lines, the
commenter said, do not present a high enough risk to public safety to make regulation cost/effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API commented that RSPA should apply just a few regulations to pipelines made economically marginal by depleted oil
fields and low oil prices. It suggested that regulations applicable to leak detection would be enough. The remaining
regulations could be waived, API said, based on evidence of negative economic impact and low risk to the area. An operator
also suggested RSPA consider granting waivers for marginal systems based on evidence of a satisfactory safety program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB said regulation of a class of pipelines should be based solely on the threat to public safety and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator of economically marginal lines said that if safety is the goal of regulation, then profitable and marginal
lines should be treated alike. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To resolve the issue of economically marginal gathering lines, we looked at the number of lines involved, the burden
of the final rule, and alternative transportation. The record shows that gathering lines in populated areas comprise
less than 10 percent of low-stress pipelines subject to the final rule. Based on the comments, we believe only a small
fraction of this number is economically marginal, transporting small volumes of oil from older, declining wells.
These pipelines would be subject to the part 195 regulations, which, on the whole, parallel the industry standards
in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' B31.4 code, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Liquid Transportation Systems for Hydrocarbons, Liquid Petroleum Gas, Anhydrous Ammonia, and Alcohols. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The compliance burden, therefore, would be similar to the burden of meeting the minimum standards the pipeline industry
has set for itself. Alternative rail or truck transportation, although perhaps more expensive, is generally available
to replace any gathering line transportation that might be shut down. Thus, we do not believe regulation of economically
marginal low-stress gathering lines will cause a significant hardship to much of the industry. Also, the potential
safety and environmental risks of economically marginal gathering lines is probably higher than that of more profitable
lines because of the increased incentive to save costs. Consequently, we decided not to include special provisions
in part 195 for economically marginal low-stress gathering lines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, consistent with API's comment and RSPA's statutory authority, we will consider requests for waiver
of particular requirements. Any request should be based on evidence of significantly adverse economic impact, low
risk, and adequate operation and maintenance practices.

Proposed &sect;195.1(d) would have allowed operators of existing low-stress pipelines 1 year after publication
of the final rule to comply with parts 195 and 199. However, the NPRM requested comment on whether 1 year would be enough
time to prepare existing pipelines for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator said 1 year would not be enough unless RSPA excludes certain economically marginal gathering lines and
accepts previous hydrostatic testing. Otherwise the operator said 2 years would be needed to establish an adequate
compliance program. One operator said 1 year would be all right for HVL and trunk lines, but 3 years would be needed for
other lines. Another operator recommended 3 to 5 years for low-stress pipelines that present a low risk because they
carry crude oil with a high flash point. Still another operator said that because many distinct pipelines would be
brought under the regulations (possibly 3,000), the minimum compliance period should be 5 years. API and an operator
argued that 3, 4, or 5 years would be needed to carry out all the requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB argued that 1 year would be sufficient because many operators of low-stress pipelines have other pipelines that
are subject to parts 195 and 199. Also, NTSB said compliance would mostly involve procedural changes. It further said
written procedures and documentation are readily available for operators not already involved with parts 195 and
199. A state agency also said 1 year would be sufficient for operators to prepare for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the diversity of conditions and importance of plans, procedures, and testing, RSPA agrees that many operators
will need more than 1 year to complete the steps necessary for existing pipelines to meet parts 195 and 199. Of particular
concern is the time needed to craft plans and procedures that address the individual conditions of the many distinct
pipelines to which the final rule applies. However, operators should not need more than 90 days to learn about the new
requirements and begin reporting accidents that might occur on low-stress pipelines. Also, within 90 days operators
should be able to meet part 195 design, construction, and hydrostatic testing requirements on portions of existing
pipelines that they replace, relocate, or otherwise change after the effective date of the final rule. Therefore,
final &sect;195.1(c) allows existing low-stress pipelines 2 years from today to comply with parts 195 and 199. However,
accident reporting under subpart B of part 195 begins 90 days from today. Also, replacements, relocations, and other
changes made to existing pipelines on or after 90 days from today must meet the design, construction, and hydrostatic
testing requirements of part 195 before operation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the allowable compliance time for existing low-stress pipelines is stated in final &sect;195.1(c), instead
of &sect;195.1(d) as proposed. We made this change because under existing &sect;195.1(c), the deadline has passed
for carbon dioxide pipelines to comply with part 195 (July 12, 1992). Accordingly, the compliance time for carbon
dioxide pipelines is being removed from &sect;195.1(c). This change makes &sect;195.1(c) available to state the
compliance time for low-stress pipelines.

G. Populated Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA proposed to define ``populated area'' as ``any onshore area other than a rural area.'' Section 195.2 defines
``rural area'' as ``outside the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated
residential or commercial area such as a subdivision, a business or shopping center, or community development.''
So a populated area would be an onshore area inside such political, residential, or commercial area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator suggested we exclude industrial areas from the definition of populated area. Because of the lack of residential
housing and associated small businesses and shopping centers in these areas, the operator said regulation would
not increase safety. RSPA strongly disagrees, however, because the rules in parts 195 and 199 protect people at large,
not just people in residential communities. Plant personnel and the environment in industrial areas are at risk from
low-stress pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator asked if part 195 would apply to an entire line section between block valves if only part of the line section
crosses a populated area. As previously explained, the pipeline segment inside the populated area and any equipment
and controls located elsewhere that are necessary for operation of the segment would have to meet part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 195 currently uses the term ``populated area'' in &sect;&sect;195.234(e)(5), 195.260(c), and 195.306 (b)(1)
and (c)(1). We did not intend that the definition of ``populated area'' proposed in the NPRM affect these rules. We
proposed the definition merely to clarify the proposed applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines. Therefore,
the final rule does not contain a definition of populated area. Instead, final &sect;195.1(b)(3), which defines
the applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines, incorporates the substance of the proposed definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For similar reasons, we revised &sect;195.1(b)(3) to include the substance of the proposed definition of ``navigable
waterway.'' Section 195.412(b) uses this term, but we intended the proposed definition to clarify only the proposed
applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines.

H. Definition of Highly Volatile Liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 195.2 defines a ``highly volatile liquid'' as a hazardous liquid that will form a vapor cloud when released
to the atmosphere and that has a vapor pressure exceeding 276 kPa (40 psia) at 37.8
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F). A ``hazardous liquid'' is defined as petroleum, petroleum products, or anhydrous ammonia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter thought RSPA should amend the current definition of ``highly volatile liquid'' to exclude gas saturated
petroleum/water mixtures if the liquid remaining after release of the gas has a vapor pressure of 40 psia or less at
100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. However, the definition does not cover such mixtures. The deciding factors in the definition are (1) the vapor
pressure of the hazardous liquid in transportation; and (2) whether that liquid will evaporate into a vapor cloud
upon release to the atmosphere. In the commenter's example, the gas in the mixture is not relevant in determining the
vapor pressure of the hazardous liquid in transportation. Since the mixture without the gas has a vapor pressure of
40 psia or less, it is not a highly volatile liquid.

I. Hydrostatic Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed to require that operators hydrostatically test new low-stress pipelines and existing low-stress
pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed. In addition, the NPRM proposed that within 1 year after
publication of the final rule, existing low-stress pipelines transporting HVL must have been hydrostatically tested
under subpart E of part 195 or not operate above 80 percent of a previous qualified test or operating pressure (proposed
&sect;195.302(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API suggested that RSPA allow 2 years instead of 1 year to complete the testing of existing HVL low-stress pipelines.
Considering the total effort companies will need to meet parts 195 and 199, RSPA agrees that 2 years is more reasonable
than 1 year to prepare for compliance. As stated above, final &sect;195.1(c) provides a 2-year compliance time for
existing low-stress pipelines. This compliance time applies to testing existing HVL low-stress pipelines under
subpart E of part 195. Therefore, a compliance time is not separately stated in final &sect;195.302(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for low-stress pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed, the NPRM did not propose to require
operators to hydrostatically test existing non-HVL low-stress pipelines. Furthermore, the NPRM explained that
non-HVL low-stress pipelines were not subject to the hydrostatic testing proposal in Docket PS&hyph;121 (56 FR 23538),
which affected many older existing hazardous liquid pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, under proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6), any non-HVL low-stress pipeline not tested to subpart E standards
could not be operated at more than ``80 percent of the test pressure or 100 percent of the highest operating pressure
to which the pipeline was subjected for four or more continuous hours that can be demonstrated by recording charts
or logs made at the time the test or operations were conducted.'' One operator suggested that proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6)
would have the effect of requiring hydrostatic testing of existing non-HVL low-stress pipelines. Testing could
be necessary if the requisite documentation were not available, or planned operations were not consistent with prior
documented test or operating pressures. RSPA did not intend this result. In fact, we proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6)
to assure that non-HVL low-stress pipelines could continue to operate without hydrostatic testing under subpart
E. Upon further consideration, RSPA believes proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6) is unnecessary for that purpose, since
&sect;195.302 clearly states which pipelines are subject to testing. So we have not adopted proposed &sect;195.406(a)(6)
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, &sect;195.406(a)(5) covers the substance of proposed &sect;195.406(a)(7), concerning the operating pressure
of HVL low-stress pipelines not tested to subpart E. Therefore, we have not adopted proposed &sect;195.406(a)(7)
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator thought the proposed rules did not clearly state the proposed exclusion of existing non-HVL low-stress
pipelines from hydrostatic testing requirements. RSPA agrees that subpart E should clearly state the applicability
of testing requirements to low-stress pipelines. Thus, we revised existing &sect;195.302, General requirements,
to clarify the exception of non-HVL low-stress pipelines from testing under subpart E.

J. Pneumatic Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comment on whether pneumatic testing should be allowed as an alternative to hydrostatic testing.
API and a state agency favored pneumatic testing as an alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three operators and a state agency encouraged RSPA to allow pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic testing.
They pointed out that pneumatic testing is permissible for low-stress pipelines in petroleum service under the ASME
B31.4 Code (section 437.4.3; 1989 edition). Two of these operators also favored pneumatic testing because it would
eliminate the need to collect and treat test water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator saw little advantage in pneumatically testing new low-stress pipelines, because the cost of waste water
disposal is not high for new lines. Two operators thought pneumatic testing would be hazardous for existing low-stress
pipelines because of the potential to mix hydrocarbons and air inside the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 195 now permits pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic testing (&sect;195.306(c)) for carbon dioxide
pipelines. Also, RSPA's gas pipeline safety standards allow pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic
testing (49 CFR 192.503). In view of these standards, the environmental advantages of pneumatic testing, and the
acceptability of pneumatic testing under the ASME B31.4 code, we believe subpart E of part 195 should allow operators
the option of pneumatically testing low-stress pipelines. Therefore, the final rule amends &sect;195.306 to allow
pneumatic testing as an alternative to hydrostatic testing on low-stress pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA recognizes that a mixture of air and residual hydrocarbons could create a potential hazard if operators pneumatically
test an existing low-stress pipeline with air instead of inert gas. However, this risk has not been a significant safety
problem for gas pipelines under 49 CFR part 192. It is common practice for operators to use proper precautions if air
is the test medium.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the NPRM, we have deferred proposing to regulate non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural ``environmentally
sensitive areas'' because we have not yet developed a suitable definition of ``environmentally sensitive area.''
We also need time to learn the extent to which pipeline spills affect such areas. Although the definition of ``environmentally
sensitive area'' in the oil spill response plan regulations (49 CFR part 194) has been used for planning purposes,
we believe that definition is too broad to use under part 195. A definition of ``environmentally sensitive area''
under part 195 must be specific enough to distinguish pipelines and segments of pipeline that are subject to the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by &sect;202 of the PSA, RSPA has scheduled publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking to define environmentally
sensitive areas, high density population areas, and navigable waterways. (See the ``Semiannual Regulatory Agenda''
at 59 FR 20662; April 25, 1994). We also intend to propose, as required by the PSA, to require all operators of hazardous
liquid pipelines (including low-stress pipelines) to identify and inventory their pipelines located in those areas
and waterways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRDC commented that there is ample evidence of pipeline damage in rural environmentally sensitive areas outside
navigable waterways, so RSPA should not postpone regulation of low-stress pipelines in those areas. NRDC suggested
that RSPA use a broad definition of environmentally sensitive area for purposes of regulating low-stress pipelines,
pending adoption of a definition required by the PSA. RSPA has not expanded the final rule to cover low-stress pipelines
in environmentally sensitive areas outside the proposed areas of regulation, because the NPRM did not propose regulation
of those pipelines at this time. However, we agree with NRDC's concerns about environmental risks, and we will consider
those concerns in future rulemaking proceedings on rural low-stress pipelines. As mentioned above, our increased
understanding of environmentally sensitive area in the pipeline context should provide a basis for future notices
of proposed rulemaking on rural gathering lines and other rural low-stress pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator thought RSPA should postpone the regulation of low-stress pipelines entirely until it proposes regulations
for non-HVL low-stress pipelines in rural environmentally sensitive areas. This operator said additional work
and effort could be avoided if it could identify pipelines in environmentally sensitive areas before establishing
a compliance program for part 195. The commenter, however, did not address the potential loss of benefits that would
result if regulation of low-stress pipelines were deferred pending decisions on environmentally sensitive areas.
Nevertheless, RSPA believes that once compliance programs are in place, extending the programs to cover additional
pipeline segments, if required, should not be too difficult. Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent an operator
from bringing all segments of a pipeline into compliance with part 195 and immediately achieving the benefits.

L. Single Public Thoroughfare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM (at 12215), RSPA mentioned that ``intra-facility piping connecting adjacent facilities separated by
navigable waterways or separated by third party property other than single public thoroughfares in populated areas
would be subject to the regulations.'' A state agency and an operator asked us to clarify this single-public-thoroughfare
exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intra-facility piping mentioned in the NPRM is functionally equivalent to in-plant piping, which is excluded
from regulation under &sect;195.1(b)(6). Essentially, intra-facility piping is transfer piping used for plant
processes. However, plants may be divided by a single public thoroughfare, and transfer piping crosses the thoroughfare.
A public thoroughfare includes any road, from a country lane to an interstate highway, but not a railroad or navigable
waterway. Because the operating conditions of transfer piping that crosses such thoroughfares are comparable in
most respects to those of other in-plant piping, RSPA considers thoroughfare crossings to be in-plant piping. This
interpretation of &sect;195.1(b)(6) is in effect now. We will apply it to low-stress pipelines under this final rule.
The thoroughfare exception does not apply to inter-facility lines or delivery lines, because these lines are different
from in-plant piping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, representing a refining department, suggested that plant transfer piping that crosses property
other than a thoroughfare right-of-way, such as industrial property, should also qualify as in-plant piping under
&sect;195.1(b)(6). This commenter also suggested that RSPA exclude inter-facility lines in industrial areas from
regulation. Neither comment was adopted. We addressed the need to regulate low-stress pipelines in industrial areas
under the subheading ``G. Populated Areas'' supra.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One operator commented that the NPRM lacked justification for the proposed regulation of offshore low-stress pipelines.
RSPA disagrees because the accident consequences discussed in the NPRM and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking
could occur offshore. Also, the NPRM discussed the need to prevent pollution of navigable waterways, which includes
offshore areas. In the final rule, &sect;195.1(b)(3) clarifies the coverage of offshore low-stress pipelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One refinery operator suggested that RSPA except non-pipeline companies from part 199, if they have a comparable
drug program and few low-stress pipelines. This commenter's primary concern was the cost of administering two separate
anti-drug programs, the company's own program and another to satisfy part 199. RSPA believes this commenter may have
overestimated the burden of compliance with part 199. Operators with comparable programs need not begin a separate
part 199 program. They could modify their present programs as necessary to meet part 199 standards. Separate plans
would not be required, although the parts of a single plan intended to meet part 199 would have to be clear and distinct
from separate company requirements. Separate tests and analyses would be required only if the company's program
required testing for drugs not covered by part 199. Considering the savings in compliance costs for operators with
comparable programs and the continuing concern that illegal drug use may adversely affect the safe operation of pipelines,
we did not adopt the refinery operator's comment.

O. Marine Terminal Piping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One operator pointed out that the US Coast Guard already regulates certain low-stress pipelines at marine terminals.
This commenter recommended that RSPA continue to except these pipelines from part 195. Alternatively, the operator
suggested RSPA establish a jurisdictional boundary with the Coast Guard to avoid duplication of agency efforts.
A boundary, said the operator, also would eliminate the confusion over which DOT regulations apply to low-stress
pipelines at marine terminals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In port areas, RSPA and the US Coast Guard have independent regulatory missions, as assigned by federal statutes.
So, hazardous liquid pipelines in port areas come under a combination of RSPA and Coast Guard regulations. At present,
we know of no conflicts or undue burdens created by these separate regulatory programs. If such difficulties surface
with respect to low-stress pipelines, we will work with the Coast Guard to minimize their impact.

P. Miscellaneous Clarifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Pipelines Subject to Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenting on low-stress pipelines that cross navigable waterways in rural areas, API and an operator suggested
that the final rule clarify how much of the entire pipeline the regulations cover. The operator thought only that part
of the pipeline that actually crosses the waterway should be covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, for non-HVL low-stress pipelines, we intended to apply the regulations only to that part of the pipeline
in the populated area or navigable waterway. Final &sect;195.1(b)(3) clarifies this intended application by including
``or pipeline segments'' immediately after ``pipelines.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator thought the wording of the proposed compliance period (proposed &sect;195.1(d)) was inconsistent
with the proposed revision of &sect;195.1(b)(3). The operator thought proposed &sect;195.1(d) implied that operators
of non-HVL low-stress pipelines located outside populated areas and navigable waterways would have to comply with
the regulations within 1 year. To avoid this misconception, we changed proposed &sect;195.1(d) (now &sect;195.1(c))
to show that the compliance period applies only to existing low-stress pipelines covered by part 195. We also clarified
the wording of proposed &sect;195.1(b)(3) to better identify low-stress pipelines that part 195 does not cover.

2. Definition of Low-Stress Pipeline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another operator suggested the final rule define the various kinds of low-stress pipelines covered. As stated above,
the proposed rules affected several kinds of distinct pipelines that operate over their full length at 20 percent
or less of SMYS, such as trunk lines and inter-facility lines. Nevertheless, since the final rules do not refer to low-stress
pipelines by kind, there is no need to define each kind of low-stress pipeline the rules cover.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have, however, added a definition of the term ``low-stress pipeline'' to &sect;195.2, based on the present wording
of &sect;195.1(b)(3). The definition enabled us to clarify that a pipeline (in the sense of a continuing run of pipe
and components used for transportation) must operate from beginning to end at 20 percent or less of SMYS to qualify
as a low-stress pipeline. In drafting the final rules, the definition also allowed us to simplify the wording of several
proposed rules.

3. Applicability of Design and Construction Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One proposed rule simplified by using the term ``low-stress pipeline'' was &sect;195.401(c)(5). The purpose of
this proposed rule was to state that the design and construction requirements of part 195 would not apply to low-stress
pipelines on which construction begins before the effective date of the final rule. Several commenters thought proposed
&sect;195.401(c)(5) lacked clarity. So we revised it in the style of similar provisions of &sect;195.401(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, one commenter pointed out that proposed &sect;195.401(c)(5) would not except existing low-stress
pipelines from design and construction rules applicable to certain interstate and intrastate pipelines under &sect;&sect;195.401(c)(1)-(3).
The final rule resolves this drafting problem by excluding low-stress pipelines from the interstate and intrastate
designations under &sect;&sect;195.401(c)(1)-(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the regulations governing the subsistence taking of northern fur seals, NMFS is required to publish an
estimate of the number of seals expected to be harvested in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut
residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK. Additionally, this document amends existing fur seal regulations, making
the subsistence harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year. The intended effect of this rule is
to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents while minimizing
negative effects on the seal population.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The northern fur seal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Callorhinus ursinus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) population is considered depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (50 CFR 216.15(c)). The subsistence
harvest of northern fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, is governed by regulations found in 50 CFR part 215,
Subpart D_Taking for Subsistence Purposes, and has been regulated to minimize negative effects on the population.
These regulations were published under the authority of the Fur Seal Act, 15 U.S.C. 1151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the MMPA, 16 U.S.C. 1361 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see 51 FR 24828, July 9, 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of these regulations is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the
Pribilof Aleuts while using humane harvesting methods, and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The St. Paul and St. George Islands' harvest estimates are given as a range, the lower end of which can be exceeded if
NMFS is given notification and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), determines that the subsistence
needs of the Aleut residents from either of the islands have not been satisfied. Conversely, the harvest can be terminated
before the lower range of the estimate is reached if it is determined that the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts
have been met or the harvest has been conducted in a wasteful manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published a summary notice of the 1993 fur seal harvest on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58297). The proposed estimates
for the 1994 fur seal subsistence harvest and the proposed rule to make the harvest take estimates applicable for 3
years instead of 1 year were published on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25024). Following acceptance and consideration of public
comments on this proposal, NMFS is publishing this final notice of the expected harvest levels for 1994, as follows:
St. Paul Island: 1,645&hyph;2,000; St. George Island: 281&hyph;500. In addition, this document amends existing
fur seal regulations, making these take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS received four sets of comments on the proposed harvest estimates and the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter opposed the proposed amendment to the existing fur seal regulations. The commenter stated that NMFS
continues to allow the wasteful taking of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands, and that the proposed rule change would
place NMFS in the position of endorsing and authorizing wasteful take for an extended period. The commenter asserted
that rather than addressing the wasteful seal killing that has persisted on those islands for years, NMFS, to the contrary,
now proposes to institutionalize this improper conduct for 3 years without further question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter voiced support for the regulatory amendment. The commenter reasoned that the take has been relatively
stable and the upper and lower limits of the estimate range were wide enough to allow change, and, therefore, as the
populations of animals and people vary, so can the target goals for future harvests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations on subsistence taking of northern fur seals have been devised to limit take to a level providing for legitimate
subsistence needs of the Pribilof Natives while minimizing negative effects on the seal population. These regulations
are intended, thus, as preventative measures against wasteful taking and improper conduct within each harvest season.
(Wasteful taking is discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993.) The rationale behind the 3 year estimate
of subsistence need versus an annual estimate was explained in the proposed estimates of subsistence need (59 FR 25024,
May 13, 1994). NMFS has recognized the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence (57 FR 34081,
August 3, 1992). As a first step towards addressing this need, NMFS proposed that &sect;215.32(b) of the fur seal regulations
be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. The regulatory amendment is based on the fact that the actual
number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent, and the fur seal take has never exceeded
the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest. NMFS anticipates that the
subsistence needs of the Pribilof Island residents may increase during the next 3 years. However, based on historical
evidence to date, the year-to-year subsistence needs are not expected to increase to levels exceeding the range established
in this final estimate.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter supported the implementation of a cooperative management plan as a means of protecting the fur seal.
The cooperative plan would expand governmental conservation efforts, and involve local people on the islands to
a larger extent in fur seal management issues. The commenter requested that particular effort be made to establish
a structure that will enable the residents of the Pribilof Islands to more actively participate in the monitoring
and regulating of the harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS agrees with the commenter's suggestions. Section 119 of the recently reauthorized MMPA allows for NMFS to enter
into cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations to conserve marine mammals and to provide for a co-management
of subsistence use by Alaska Natives. NMFS intends to pursue the development of such a program that would further the
goal of cooperative management and monitoring with the Alaskan native organizations.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the 1994 subsistence estimates are too high because they are based on historically wasteful
seal killing practices carried over from the period of commercial harvest when only the choicest cuts of meat were
taken for human consumption. The commenter continued by stating that through the adoption of these estimates, NMFS
further institutionalizes waste and sanctions a level of seal killing known to reflect wasteful practices.

 This comment is similar to the one presented and discussed in the final subsistence estimates for 1993 (58 FR 42027,
August 6, 1993). In that final notice, a commenter maintained that the present harvest level did not reflect the true
subsistence need on the Pribilof Islands. However, available information indicates that the present number of fur
seals taken for subsistence on the Pribilof Islands is not higher than necessary to provide for subsistence needs.
During one of the last periods when fur seals were taken solely for subsistence purposes on St. Paul Island, 1912&hyph;16,
the number of fur seals taken each year (range 1,764&hyph;3,483) was significantly higher than it is at present, even
though the human population on St. Paul Island at that time was less than one-half of the present population. Therefore,
the commenter has inaccurately assumed that practices carried over from the commercial harvest have resulted in
a level of subsistence use greater than that used historically on the Pribilof Islands.

A commenter stated that there is no basis for setting the lower end of the estimated subsistence range based on the greatest
number of seals killed during any year over the past 6 years.

 NMFS believes that the present range of fur seal subsistence estimates used on St. Paul and St. George Islands are justified.
During the past 3 years the number of seals taken in the subsistence harvest has stabilized, ranging from 1,482 to 1,645
takes each year on St. Paul Island and from 194 to 319 each year on St. George Island. Generally, the lower limits of the
estimate ranges for the islands have been approached during each of the past 3 years, but a difference of 1 or 2 actual
days of harvest between years can result in the difference observed between the estimated number and actual number
of seals taken within any one season. The apparent trend toward stability in the harvest totals on St. Paul and St. George
Islands indicates to NMFS that the proposed estimates of annual need accurately reflect the actual subsistence requirements
on the islands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the estimate of need should not be based on numbers of seals. Rather, it should be based on
the quantity of meat that is required for subsistence needs. The commenter provided data indicating that, by its calculations,
approximately 450&hyph;570 fewer seals could have been harvested on St. Paul Island in 1993 had the harvest estimates
been based on the amount of meat required by residents of St. Paul, rather than based on a number of seals required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter's estimate of the number of seals that need not have been killed in 1993 (450&hyph;570) was based on an
average maximum percent-use value of 60 percent. This value was a result of a 1987 study in which 83 seals were weighed
before and after virtually all consumable parts (including many parts that are only marginally edible, such as connective
tissues, etc.) had been removed (i.e., everything was taken except for the pelt, blubber, skull, neck, inedible internal
organs, and body fluids). This butchering technique is referred to as a whole cut, and a mean 53.3 percent of each animal
(maximum approximately 60 percent) was dressed out under these circumstances (53 FR 17773, May 18, 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1987 harvest, 101 carcasses were also weighed before and after butchering had removed only the front flippers,
shoulders, breasts, hearts and livers (referred to as the butterfly cut), the parts historically eaten. A mean 29.1
percent of each animal was dressed out under these circumstances (53 FR 17773, May 18, 1988). Thus, it was determined
that the range of percent-use values between animals that have been butchered to remove only selected parts, and animals
that have been butchered to remove virtually all consumable parts (including many parts only marginally edible),
lies between 29.1 and 53.3 percent of the initial carcass weight. Whether the harvest is being conducted in a wasteful
versus non-wasteful manner focuses on whether or not the butterfly cut method of butchering is interpreted as a wasteful
manner as defined in the regulations. NMFS determined, based on a 1992 study, that the butterfly cut does not represent
a wasteful manner of taking (discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1992 harvest, NMFS weighed the whole carcass, as well as the weight of each major body part (breast, shoulder,
arm, ribs, backbone, and hindquarter as well as heart, liver, front flippers, rear flippers, head, guts and pelt),
to determine the proportion of edible meat that was available from the different parts of the body for each of six fur
seals. In summary, the mean weight of the parts taken in a whole cut totaled 54.9 percent of the beginning weight of the
seals, and the mean weight for the parts constituting a butterfly cut was 32.5 percent, indicating a mean percent-use
difference of approximately 22 percent. However, using mean values from the 1992 study, the total amount of edible
meat (excluding bone, minimally edible connective tissue, and inedible tissue) available from a whole cut seal was
29.6 percent (range 26.8&hyph;31.6) of the beginning weight of the animal compared to 21.1 percent (range 18.9&hyph;23.4)
taken from a butterfly cut seal. Therefore, the average difference in the amount of edible meat between the two butchering
techniques is approximately 8&hyph;9 percent of the original body weight of the animal, not the 22 percent difference
that has been widely used to characterize the two different techniques, and that was used in the commenters calculations.
As NMFS explained in the 1993 document of final subsistence estimates, while a whole cut does result in more meat being
made available for subsistence use than does the butterfly cut, both cuts result in a substantial portion of the edible
parts of the seal being used for subsistence, and the real difference in edible meat being made available to the user
has been greatly exaggerated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter cautioned that NMFS must guard against economic incentives that might lead to higher harvest levels.
The commenter continued to state that NMFS should retrieve all seal penis bones or bacula to assure that potential
trade in these items will not result in excessive seal killing. The commenter did not feel that this was either unreasonable
or burdensome on the part of NMFS. Moreover, some Pribilof residents have suggested this approach as a means to reassure
concerned parties that the commercial value of seal bacula is not an incentive for harvesting fur seals.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS' position is that the subsistence harvest and the estimates of subsistence needs must not be based upon commercial
interests. There is no indication that the harvest is being driven by commercial interests; however, NMFS will continue
to monitor the disposal of carcasses, and the removal of bacula from animals taken in the harvest, to ensure that commercial
interests are not factors in the subsistence harvest.

One commenter stated that the subsistence harvest methods used by the Aleut sealers do not need to be monitored or regulated
to ensure compliance with NMFS' standards for substantial use of seal carcasses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations governing the subsistence harvest of fur seals require that NMFS' representatives monitor the harvest
and collect information on the number of seals taken and the extent of utilization of the fur seals taken (51 FR 24832,
July 9, 1986). NMFS believes that alternatives to the present fur seal management regime should be considered and
discussed during the development of a cooperation management program under section 119 of the MMPA. The commenters'
concerns will be considered further in these discussions and in any future rulemaking to revise these regulations.

Subsistence Harvest Estimates for 1994 Through 1996
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS published a document proposing a range of subsistence need estimates for 1994&hyph;96 based on the results of
the 1992&hyph;93 harvests (59 FR 25024, May 13, 1994). NMFS proposed that the lower bound of the harvest estimate for
northern fur seals on St. Paul Island for each year, 1994&hyph;96, remain at 1,645 (the same as that in 1992 and 1993).
If the Aleut residents of St. Paul Island reach the lower limit of the estimated range of animals during the harvest,
and still have unmet subsistence needs, they may request an additional number of seals, up to a harvest total of 2,000
fur seals. For St. George Island, NMFS also proposed that the lower bound of the estimate of subsistence need for each
year, 1994&hyph;96, remain at the 1992 and 1993 level of 281 fur seals. If the Aleut residents of St. George Island reach
the lower level of estimated need during the 1994 harvest, and still have unmet subsistence needs, they may request
an additional number of seals up to a harvest total of 500 (the upper bound estimated for the 1991&hyph;93 harvests).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Aleut residents of St. Paul and St. George Islands may harvest up to the lower bound of the applicable estimate between
June 23 and August 8 of each year, 1994&hyph;96. If, at any time during the harvest, the lower estimate of subsistence
need for an island is reached, the harvest must be suspended for no longer than 48 hours, pursuant to 50 CFR 215.32(e)(1)(iii),
pending a review of the harvest data to determine if the subsistence needs of the island residents have been met. At
such time, the Pribilof Aleuts may submit information indicating that subsistence needs (for either island) have
not been met. This information should be submitted as quickly as possible, optimally just prior to the time that notification
is given that the lower end of the harvest estimate has been reached in order to assure that the required harvest suspension
lasts no longer than 48 hours. If the Pribilof Aleuts substantiate an additional need for seals, and there has been
no indication of waste, the AA must provide a revised estimate of the number of seals required for subsistence purposes.
If additional information is not submitted by the Pribilof Aleuts, the AA will consider only the information in the
record at the time of the suspension. It is likely, under such circumstances, that the revised subsistence estimate
would remain the same as the original estimate. If that is the case, no additional takings would be authorized.

NMFS has determined that the approval and implementation of this document and amendment to the current regulation
will not significantly affect the human environment, and that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement
on this is not required by section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act or its implementing regulations.
This rule makes only minor changes to the regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes;
this action does not entail significant substantive revision. Because this rule does not alter the conclusions of
previous environmental impact analyses and environmental assessments (EA), it is categorically excluded by NOAA
Administrative Order 216&hyph;6 from the requirement to prepare an EA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

A 3-day extension of the north Washington coast (waters west of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line and south to the Queets River)
sport halibut fishery during June 9 through June 11 resulted in a harvest of 10,649 lb (4.83 mt). This brings the season
harvest to 65,298 lb (29.62 mt), 2,741 lb (1.24 mt) shy of the 68,039 lb (30.86 mt) catch limit. The remaining catch limit
is too small to allow for a full day of fishing without exceeding the catch limit. Therefore, the sport halibut fishery
in this area will remain closed for the remainder of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anglers landing in Neah Bay have caught an estimated 13,000 lb (5.90 mt) of Pacific halibut from Canadian waters. Fishing
remains open in Canadian waters with a two-fish daily bag limit and no size restriction. Anglers desiring to fish in
Canadian waters are strongly urged to contact Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans at (604) 666-0383/0583 for
sport fishing information concerning licensing and the nautical description of closed areas.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that an emergency exists in the groundfish fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management
area (BSAI). An unusually large number of salmon other than chinook (``other'' salmon) were caught incidentally
by trawl catcher vessels operating in the catcher vessel operational area (CVOA) during the 1993 pollock non-roe
season. In 1993, the number of ``other'' salmon caught incidentally in the BSAI groundfish fisheries was 245,000
fish_approximately six times the bycatch level estimated for each of the previous 2 years and triple the previous
highest bycatch amount. Approximately 95 percent of this catch is chum salmon. If not controlled, a large number of
chum salmon could be incidentally caught again during the 1994 pollock non-roe season, potentially causing serious
conservation and management problems. NMFS is implementing by emergency rule, certain management measures necessary
to address this problem. These measures are intended to accomplish the goals and objectives of the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) with respect to fisheries management in the BSAI.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared
by the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR part 675. General
regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At times, amendments to an FMP or its implementing regulations are necessary to respond to fishery conservation and
management problems that cannot be addressed within the time frame of the normal procedures provided for by the Magnuson
Act. Section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act authorizes the Secretary to implement emergency regulations necessary to
address these situations. These emergency regulations may remain in effect for not more than 90 days after date of
publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, with a possible 90-day extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the number of ``other'' salmon caught incidentally in the BSAI groundfish fisheries increased significantly
over the 1991 and 1992 amounts of 36,000 and 39,000 fish, respectively. The 1993 total ``other'' salmon bycatch amount
was 245,000 fish_approximately six times the bycatch level estimated for each of the previous 2 years and triple the
previous highest bycatch amount of 72,000 ``other'' salmon estimated in the 1984 foreign trawl fishery. ``Other''
salmon bycatch was estimated to be below 10,000 fish, both prior to 1983 and between 1987 and 1990. ``Other'' salmon
is defined as salmon other than chinook salmon. Historical data indicate that approximately 95 percent of the ``other''
salmon bycatch in the Bering Sea is chum salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poor returns of chum salmon to western Alaska river systems during 1993 caused the Alaska Department of Fish and Game
(ADF&amp;G) to close commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries in several western Alaska districts. Projections
for 1994 are for below average returns in many districts. The salmon caught as bycatch in the 1993 pollock non-roe season
were primarily in the size range of 3-year-old fish, which would have matured in 1994. Little information exists about
the potential effect the 1993 chum salmon bycatch will have on the 1994 returns in western Alaska because stock composition
of the chum salmon bycatch during the pollock non-roe season is unknown. However, the magnitude of the 1993 chum salmon
bycatch in the pollock non-roe season is of concern, regardless of the origin of these fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To respond to this concern, NMFS, in consultation with the Council, implements the following three measures under
emergency rulemaking, to address the chum salmon bycatch problem in the 1994 BSAI pollock non-roe season: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Establishment of a 42,000 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit in the CVOA which, when reached, closes a portion of the
CVOA to vessels using trawl gear; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requirement for two observers on mothership processor vessels that receive groundfish caught in the CVOA during
the 1994 pollock non-roe season; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Requirement for electronic communication capabilities for each mothership processor vessel required to carry
two observers under this emergency rule and for each shoreside facility that receives pollock harvested from the
CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season that is required to have 100 percent observer coverage under 50 CFR 672.27
or 675.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These measures are described in detail and justified below.

At its April 1994 meeting, the Council requested that NMFS prepare emergency rulemaking that would provide the authority
to close an area within the CVOA to all vessels using trawl gear if the ``other'' salmon bycatch in the CVOA during 1994
reaches 42,000 fish. This measure is intended to prevent 1994 chum salmon bycatch numbers from approaching the level
experienced in the 1993 fishery. Establishing the bycatch limit at 42,000 ``other'' salmon accommodates pre-1993
levels while preventing excessive bycatch.

If the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit established for the CVOA is taken, NMFS will close the salmon savings area to
all vessels using trawl gear through November 12, 1994_the expiration date of this emergency rule. The salmon savings
area historically has accounted for a large proportion of ``other'' salmon bycatch and a relatively small proportion
of groundfish harvest. The recommended 42,000 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit represents 50 percent of the 1991,
1992, and 1993 average of ``other'' salmon bycatch in the CVOA. The 42,000 ``other'' salmon limit approximates the
1991 and 1992 bycatch, while providing some buffer to accommodate slight increases in bycatch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is intended to prevent a recurrence of the high 1993 chum salmon bycatch experienced during the BSAI pollock
non-roe season. The bycatch of ``other'' salmon appears to be a function of the time of year, distribution of fishing
effort, and spatial distribution of salmon. Historical data indicate that ``other'' salmon bycatch is reduced generally
during the winter months and elevated during the months of July through October. Approximately 67 percent of all ``other''
salmon bycatch in observed hauls during 1991 was taken during August, and 40 percent and 62 percent of the 1992 and 1993
``other'' salmon bycatch, respectively, was taken during the month of September. Starting in 1993, the opening of
the pollock non-roe season was delayed from June 1 until August 15 (58 FR 30997, May 28, 1993). This delay was implemented
to achieve increased revenues from the harvest of BSAI pollock during the non-roe season and to provide participants
in the pollock non-roe fishery increased opportunities to fish in other groundfish fisheries. Although the delay
of the pollock non-roe season until August 15 was expected to increase chum salmon bycatch, the magnitude of the 1993
bycatch amount was not anticipated. Spatially, the number of ``other'' salmon appears to be highest south of 57
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N. lat. and east of 168
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; W. long. Consistent with historical data, about 80 percent of the 1993 BSAI ``other'' salmon bycatch was taken
in the CVOA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis of historical observer data relative to the 1993 pollock non-roe season chum salmon bycatch was not available
prior to the Council's April 1994 meeting. Therefore, the recently discovered circumstances surrounding the 1993
chum salmon bycatch problem provided little opportunity for the Council to respond through normal rulemaking before
the opening of the 1994 pollock non-roe season on August 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered seven different alternatives for time/area closures to limit chum salmon bycatch during
the 1994 pollock non-roe season. The recommended area was chosen as a minimum closure area that would provide the most
consistent protection to ``other'' salmon during the pollock non-roe season, but would still allow access to productive
pollock fishing grounds. During the period July through October, the recommended salmon savings area accounted
for 1.0, 0.8, and 7.0 percent of the total annual observed groundfish catch in the BSAI pollock and Pacific cod trawl
fisheries during 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. During the period July through October of 1991, 1992, and 1993,
this area accounted for 38, 40, and 54 percent, respectively, of the total annual ``other'' salmon bycatch. During
the period July through October 1993, the salmon savings area had the highest ``other'' salmon bycatch rate of the
areas analyzed_approximately 1.2 ``other'' salmon per metric ton of groundfish.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS must rely on data collected by NMFS-certified observers to manage the 1994 ``other'' salmon bycatch limit of
42,000 fish. Currently, one observer is required on each mothership processor vessel participating in either the
inshore or offshore component of the pollock fishery. Under a regulatory amendment effective May 20, 1994 (59 FR 18757,
April 20, 1994), all salmon taken in BSAI trawl operations must be retained until the number of salmon is determined
by a NMFS-certified observer. NMFS intends to use these observed counts to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit,
unless other information indicates that these numbers do not provide the best information available on salmon bycatch.
To monitor the chum salmon bycatch limit effectively and to prevent the 42,000 fish bycatch limit from being exceeded,
NMFS must receive daily reports of salmon bycatch numbers. NMFS typically receives weekly reports on groundfish
catch and on prohibited species bycatch to monitor the fisheries. The time required to process these reports results
in a delay between the receipt of reports and determination of overall catch statistics that provide the basis for
determining whether a closure is required. If the ``other'' salmon bycatch in 1994 were to proceed at the 1993 rate
(i.e., approximately 39,000 fish in week 1; 26,000 fish in week 2; and 47,000 fish in week 3), weekly reporting would
not be sufficient to prevent the 42,000 ``other'' salmon limit from being exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective monitoring of the bycatch limit requires a second observer on each mothership processor vessel that receives
fish from catcher boats fishing in the CVOA during the pollock non-roe season. This is necessary to ensure accurate
and timely counts of salmon bycatch, without compromising the other groundfish sampling duties of the observer.
Observers onboard mothership processor vessels currently sample approximately two out of every ten hauls. The time
required to count salmon bycatch under the May 20, 1994, regulatory amendment, and to transmit these data on a daily
basis, places an extra burden on observers stationed on mothership processor vessels. According to 1993 records,
the salmon bycatch rate was greater for mothership processor vessels (0.813 ``other'' salmon/mt groundfish) than
for shoreside plants (0.343 ``other'' salmon/mt groundfish). NMFS will require the additional observers to remain
onboard the mothership processor vessels until either (1) the salmon savings area is closed, or (2) the salmon bycatch
rates are sufficiently low such that daily observer reports are no longer needed to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch
limit established for the CVOA.

The observer requirements and the requirements for electronic communication capabilities are necessary for NMFS
to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit effectively. The affected mothership processing vessels and processors
must obtain for observers' use the data entry software program provided by the Regional Director. To enable the observers
to report haul-by-haul statistics and salmon bycatch numbers on a daily basis, the operator of each mothership processor
vessel that receives fish harvested in the CVOA must provide INMARSAT Standard A satellite communication capabilities
and associated software (cc:Mail remote and a data entry program provided by the Regional Director) for observers'
use. Each mothership processor vessel must also have the following equipment or equipment compatible therewith
and having the ability to operate the NMFS-supplied data entry software program: a personal computer (PC) with a 386
or better processing chip, a DOS version 3.0 operating system, and 5 megabytes of free hard disk storage available
for the observers' use. Each shoreside facility that receives pollock harvested in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock
non-roe season and that is required to have 100-percent observer coverage under 50 CFR 672.27 and 675.25, must have
the capability to transmit data over telephone lines using a computer modem. These processors will make available
to observers the following equipment or equipment compatible therewith: a PC with a 386 or better processing chip,
with at least a 9600 baud modem, and a phone line. The PC must be equipped with a mouse, Windows version 3.1 or a program
having the ability to operate the NMFS-supplied data entry software program, and have at least 5 megabytes of free
hard disk storage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pollock harvests during the non-roe season are apportioned between the ``inshore'' and the ``offshore'' components.
During the 1993 non-roe season, the inshore component was comprised of seven shoreside processing plants, one mothership
processor vessel, and five trawl catcher/processors. These processors processed approximately 235,000 mt of pollock.
The offshore component was comprised of three mothership processors and 52 trawl catcher/processors. Sixteen of
these trawl catcher/processors also received pollock deliveries from catcher vessels. The offshore component
harvested about 414,000 mt of pollock during the directed non-roe season fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-five trawl catcher vessels delivered pollock to shoreside processing plants and 25 trawl catcher vessels
delivered pollock to mothership processors. These 90 catcher vessels delivered about 233,000 mt of pollock to shoreside
processing plants and 121,000 mt to mothership processor vessels, for a total of about 354,000 mt of pollock. Therefore,
trawl catcher vessels harvested about 55 percent of the pollock during the 1993 non-roe season and trawl catcher/processors
harvested about 45 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The salmon savings area is completely within the CVOA. Closure of this area would affect only the pollock harvest areas
available to trawl catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processing plants and mothership processor vessels.
Most of the harvest by these catcher vessels during the 1993 non-roe season occurred within the CVOA. Preliminary
examination of 1993 ADF&amp;G fish tickets indicates that at least five out of seven shoreside processing plants
received some pollock harvested within the salmon savings area during the 1993 pollock non-roe season. Harvests
within the salmon savings area represented about 10 percent of the total 1993 non-roe season pollock harvests by trawl
catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processing plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure of the salmon savings area would only occur if the salmon bycatch limit was reached and would not affect significantly
the opportunity available to catcher vessels to harvest available pollock TAC. Most of the area within the CVOA that
is currently available to the catcher vessels would remain open to pollock fishing. Based on 1993 non-roe season fishing
patterns, closure of the salmon savings area would have resulted in relocation of catcher vessels within the Bering
Sea for less than 10 percent of their pollock harvests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The observer and equipment requirements of this action apply only to mothership processing vessels or shoreside
processing plants receiving fish caught by catcher vessels from the CVOA. Direct costs are limited to those participants,
estimated to be four mothership processing vessels and seven shoreside processing plants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Direct costs for observer coverage are estimated to be about $200 per day per observer. The cost of a second observer
on the four mothership processor vessels would depend on the number of days the additional observer was required.
The number of observer days for each mothership processor vessel during the 1993 non-roe season ranged from 39 to 58
days. Based on the observer coverage requirements for 1993, a second observer during the 1994 non-roe season could
cost from $7,800 (39 days x $200/day) to $11,600 (58 days x $200/day) per mothership processor vessel. Based on the
actual number of fishing days, the total cost for all four mothership processor vessels would be $37,400 (187 days
x $200/day), if the second observer were required for the same amount of observer coverage days as during the 1993 non-roe
season. If the second observer is required for only a portion of the 1994 non-roe season, additional observer costs
would be $200 per day per mothership processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs could also be incurred for the acquisition of electronic mail software and a personal computer that satisfies
the hardware requirements detailed above. The cost for these items could range from $200&hyph;1200. Mothership
processing vessels have the INMARSAT A satellite communication capabilities and necessary computer hardware,
and most shoreside facilities have the necessary computer hardware for electronic transmission of data. NMFS will
supply the necessary data entry software and will provide installation free of charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure of the salmon savings area to vessels using trawl gear will also affect any trawl vessels that may have otherwise
fished in this area in non-pollock target fisheries. However, examination of 1993 catch information indicates that
no significant amounts of other groundfish fishing or pollock Community Development Quota fishing occurred in the
salmon savings area subsequent to closure of the directed inshore and offshore component pollock fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management measures responding to the information recently presented to the Council are necessary to mitigate potentially
adverse impacts of chum salmon bycatch on western Alaska salmon resources and to reduce chum salmon bycatch in 1994.
NMFS is implementing this emergency action for the 1994 pollock non-roe season because the high chum salmon bycatch
occurred primarily in the pollock non-roe season in 1993 and a large proportion of this bycatch occurred in the salmon
savings area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS concurs that the above regulatory measures must be implemented by emergency rulemaking to prevent high bycatch
of chum salmon by catcher vessels fishing for groundfish in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), proposes
to issue regulations for the employees of the Corporation which would supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct
for Employees of the Executive Branch (Executive Branch-wide Standards) issued by OGE. The proposed rule is a necessary
supplement to the Executive Branch-wide Standards and has been designed to address the specialized functions and
operations of the Corporation. The proposed rule would establish: prohibitions on borrowing and extensions of credit;
prohibitions on the ownership of certain financial interests; prohibitions on the purchase of property controlled
by the Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); limitations on official dealings with former employers
and clients; disqualification requirements relating to employment of family members outside the Corporation;
and limitations on outside employment activities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct For Employees of the
Executive Branch. See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583, with an additional grace
period extension at 59 FR 4779&hyph;4780. The Executive Branch-wide Standards, now codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and
effective February 3, 1993, establish uniform standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the concurrence of the OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103&hyph;204)
authorize the Corporation to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations necessary to implement its ethics
programs. The Corporation and OGE have determined that the following supplemental regulations contained in the
proposed rule are necessary to successfully continue the Corporation's ethics program in light of the Corporation's
unique programs and operations. The proposed supplemental rule addresses issues relevant to the Corporation's
specialized roles as the insurer, conservator, receiver, liquidator, organizer of bridge banks, and regulator
or back-up enforcement agency for FDIC-insured depository institutions. Upon finalization of the supplemental
regulation, the Corporation will, as proposed, delete those portions of 12 CFR part 336 that are superseded by the
Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis of Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following regulations are proposed to appear in new part 3201 of 5 CFR chapter XXII. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3201.101&blank;General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;3201.101(a) explains that the regulations would apply to all Corporation employees and would supplement
the Executive Branch-wide Standards. Because they are covered under rules applicable to the Department of the Treasury,
two members of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
would be covered only by those provisions of the supplemental regulation specifically made applicable to them in
connection with their activities as members of the Corporation's Board of Directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corporation ethics officials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;3201.101(b) explains that the Designated Agency Ethics Official would be the Executive Secretary
and that the Alternate Agency Ethics Official would be the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) of the FDIC. This
provision would delegate authority to the Executive Secretary and the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) to
act in such capacities as contemplated under 5 CFR part 2638. The provision would continue the designations currently
found at 12 CFR part 336, as updated to accommodate organizational changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agency designees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;3201.101(c) specifies those employees who would hold the authority to act as agency designees under
the Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulation. It also explains that only the Ethics Counselor
or Alternate Ethics Counselor would be able to delegate authority to act as agency designees and that such delegation
would have to be in writing and could not be re-delegated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;3201.101(d) would include as an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
affiliate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 those companies which control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, an FDIC-insured depository institution.
The definition for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
affiliate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was taken from the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is intended to be broadly interpreted and include any holding
companies, subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies of an FDIC-insured depository institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
appropriate director
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would include the heads of offices and divisions in the Washington office, the highest ranking officials in each division
in the regional offices, and the Ethics Counselor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
covered employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would include all employees of the Corporation required to file confidential or public financial disclosure reports
under 5 CFR part 2634 or 5 CFR part 3202.

Under the proposed regulation, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would include all persons, other than special Government employees, employed by the Corporation. Pursuant to the
Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103&hyph;204), the Corporation is also required to consider
the employees of contractors as employees of the Corporation for certain purposes. Therefore, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would include, for purposes of 5 CFR part 2635 and &sect;&sect;3201.103 and 3201.104 of this part, any individual
who, pursuant to a contract or any other arrangement, performs functions or activities of the Corporation, under
the direct supervision of an officer or employee of the Corporation. The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not include independent contractors who are not deemed to be employees under 12 U.S.C. 1822(f)(1)(B). In the
case of members of the Board of Directors, it would include only the three members appointed by the President under
12 U.S.C. 1812(a)(1)(C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation provides a broad definition of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
security
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which includes an interest in debt or equity instruments such as, for example, stocks, bonds, and commercial paper.
However, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
security
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not include a deposit account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State nonmember bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a statutory term taken from 12 U.S.C. 1813 and would include all State banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve
System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
subsidiary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was taken from section 3(w) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, codified to 12 U.S.C. 1813(w), and would include
all companies owned or controlled directly or indirectly by another company.

Section 3201.102&blank;Extensions of Credit From FDIC-Insured Depository Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules on extensions of credit from FDIC-insured depository institutions provide the conditions under
which certain specified categories of Corporation employees can obtain credit from depository institutions insured
by the Corporation. Restrictions on the availability of credit to Corporation employees are necessary for several
reasons. First, 5 CFR 2635.403(a) permits the Corporation to prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a
financial interest or class of financial interests by Corporation employees, and the spouses and minor children
of those employees, when the Corporation has made the determination that the acquisition or holding of such financial
interests would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which Corporation programs
are administered, and 5 CFR 2635.403(c) specifically provides that the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
financial interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may include an indebtedness relationship. For purposes of the extensions of credit covered by &sect;3201.102 (a)
through (d), the Corporation has made such a determination. These prohibitions and restrictions on employees entering
into financial arrangements with institutions over which the Corporation has regulatory and resolution authority
are necessary to prevent loss of public confidence in the integrity of the Corporation. In addition, the borrowing
prohibition would incorporate the substance of the statutory prohibition at 18 U.S.C. 213 on bank examiners accepting
certain loans. Finally, limitations on borrowing from FDIC-insured depository institutions would avoid a high
number of employee disqualifications that would have a detrimental effect on the Corporation's administration
of its multifaceted responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;3201.102(a), a current or contingent financial obligation of an employee is considered a financial
obligation for purposes of the prohibition, disqualification, and retention provisions of proposed &sect;3201.102.
A current or contingent financial obligation of a spouse or minor child is attributed to the employee for purposes
of this section since the Corporation has determined, pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.403(a), that there is a direct and appropriate
nexus between the efficiency of the service and the prohibitions and restrictions in &sect;3201.102 as applied to
the spouses and minor children of Corporation employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;3201.102(b), members of the Board of Directors and other Corporation officials who are in top
management positions would be prohibited from incurring financial obligations with an institution over which the
Corporation has primary Federal supervisory authority or a subsidiary of such an institution. A deputy or an assistant
to the Board of Directors or to an individual board member, a covered employee who is an assistant to such deputy or assistant,
the director of a Washington office or division (other than the Division of Supervision), and a covered employee immediately
subordinate to such a director would be included in the restricted class. The prohibition would not apply to credit
extended through an ordinary credit card relationship due to the standardized handling and low credit amounts customary
in such relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;3201.102(c), depository institutions examination staff, including all covered employees assigned
to the Division of Supervision, would be prohibited from obtaining credit from an FDIC-insured State nonmember bank,
the class of FDIC-insured depository institutions for which the FDIC has primary supervisory responsibility, any
subsidiary of such bank, or any person employed by such bank. An exception would be carved out for an ordinary credit
card relationship but, for those employees assigned to regional or field offices, the exception would be limited
to credit cards offered by FDIC-insured State nonmember banks located outside the employee's region of assignment.
The rule, which is substantially the same as 12 CFR 336.16(a), is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 213 which prohibits examiners
from accepting credit from institutions which they have examined. Under the proposed rule, an employee would be required
to file a report upon obtaining a credit card from a State nonmember bank located outside the employee's region of assignment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;3201.102(d) would impose a two-year prohibition on an employee in the Division of Finance, the Division
of Depositor and Asset Services, the Division of Resolutions, or the Legal Division, or who is a member of a standing
committee of the Board of Directors obtaining credit from an FDIC-insured depository institution or its subsidiary
when the employee has participated personally and substantially in certain matters affecting the institution,
its predecessor or successor, or an affiliate of such institution. This prohibition would be applicable to the universe
of FDIC-insured depository institutions and would be limited to those Corporation employees who perform functions
associated with the audit, resolution, liquidation, supervision, or agency deliberation affecting a specific
FDIC-insured depository institution. The two-year prohibition has been designed to eliminate concerns over potential
benefits that an employee holding a sensitive non-examiner position could derive through a financial relationship
with an institution that has close business ties to the Corporation. An exception has been made for an ordinary credit
card relationship. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
personally and substantially
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be found at 5 CFR 2635.402(b)(4) of the Executive Branch-wide Standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;3201.102(e)(1) would prohibit a member of the depository institution's examination staff, including
senior level staff, from participating in the supervisory review of any institution with which they hold an extension
of credit. No exceptions to this rule have been provided due to the sensitive nature of the duties involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;3201.102(e)(2)&hyph;(4), a covered employee and the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director
of the Office of Thrift Supervision would be prohibited from participating in matters affecting persons with whom
the employee has an outstanding extension of credit. Exceptions have been provided for ordinary credit card relationships
or when the agency designee, with the concurrence of the appropriate director, determines that participation by
the employee would be appropriate under the standard outlined under 5 CFR 2635.502(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;3201.102(f) would clarify that an employee may retain certain extensions of credit that he or she
would be prohibited from obtaining anew. For example, an employee who had obtained an extension of credit prior to
employment with the Corporation would not be required to refinance the credit. Any extension of credit retained under
this section would be required to be reported to an agency designee. An employee would not be allowed to renew or renegotiate
the credit without the consent of the agency designee and appropriate director or, in the case of certain higher-level
officials, without the consent of the Ethics Counselor. This provision is substantially the same as current 12 CFR
336.16(d), and extensions of credit which were permissibly held under such provision could be retained under the
new provision.

it insures, restrictions on employee ownership of securities in such institutions are necessary in order to maintain
public confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the Corporation executes its various functions;
eliminate concerns by private entities that sensitive information provided to the Corporation might be used for
private gain; and avoid the widespread disqualification of employees from their duties which could result in the
Corporation having difficulty in performing its mission. Under proposed &sect;3201.103(a), an employee would
be prohibited from having a direct or indirect ownership interest in a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution
or an affiliate of such institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the exceptions in &sect;3201.103(b) would allow an employee to acquire, own or control certain direct
and indirect ownership interests in an FDIC-insured depository institution. For example, an employee would be permitted
to retain an interest which had been acquired prior to employment with the Corporation or involuntarily acquired
by the employee such as by gift, stock split, or through a merger of a company. An employee could also acquire, own or
control an interest in an FDIC-insured depository institution through the investment vehicle of a publicly traded
or available diversified investment fund when the fund does not have an objective or practice of concentrating its
investments in securities of the financial services sector. An employee who owned securities of an FDIC-insured
depository institution under one of the exceptions in proposed &sect;3201.103(b) would be disqualified under 5
CFR 2635.402 from participating in any particular matter that, by reason of his or her ownership of those securities,
affects his or her financial interests or those of his or her spouse or minor child. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;3201.103(c), the Ethics Counselor could require an employee, or the spouse or minor child of
an employee, to divest an ownership interest that would otherwise be allowed to be retained under &sect;3201.103(b)
using the standard set forth in 5 CFR 2635.403(b).

Section 3201.104&blank;Restrictions Concerning the Purchase of Property Held by the Corporation or the RTC as Conservator,
Receiver, or Liquidator of the Assets of an Insured Depository Institution, or by a Bridge Bank Organized by the Corporation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to avoid any self-dealing, appearance of self-dealing, adversarial relationship with the Corporation,
or diminution of public confidence in the Corporation's ability to accomplish its mission, an employee, or the spouse
or minor child of an employee, would be prohibited under &sect;3201.104(a) from purchasing assets held by the Corporation
or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as conservator, receiver, or liquidator or held by a bridge bank organized
by the Corporation. In such roles, the Corporation and the RTC generally act as a fiduciary to the creditors of failed
depository institutions. Property held by the RTC has been included in the proposed prohibition because of the RTC's
significant ties with the Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, &sect;3201.104(b) would disqualify an employee involved in the disposition of the assets of a failed
insured depository institution from participation in the disposition of such assets when the employee knows that
a person with whom he or she holds a covered relationship intends to purchase such assets. Written notification of
the disqualification would be required to be made by the employee to his or her immediate supervisor and the agency
designee.

Section 3201.105&blank;Prohibition on Dealings With Former Employers, Associates, and Clients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to avoid the appearance of favoritism and maintain the integrity of the Corporation's regulatory oversight,
insurance assessments, and resolution and liquidation transactions, proposed &sect;3201.105(a) would prohibit
an employee, for a period of one year after entering on duty with the Corporation, from participating in official Corporation
matters involving an employer with whom the employee worked during the year preceding the employee's entry on duty
with the Corporation. Proposed &sect;3201.105(b) would include within the definition of the term employer a broad
range of persons, as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502, with whom the employee has a covered relationship. In an individual
case, &sect;3201.105(c) would give the agency designee discretion to extend the prohibition beyond the one year
period that would automatically apply to all new Corporation employees.

Section 3201.106&blank;Employment of Family Members Outside the Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, &sect;3201.106 would continue the Corporation's requirement at 12 CFR 336.21 that an employee be disqualified
from participation in particular matters involving employers of family members or members of the employee's household.
It would also require the employee to report the employment of family members or members of the employee's household
by FDIC-insured depository institutions or companies that have business, or are seeking to do business, with the
Corporation. This requirement eliminates the potential for any appearance of preferential treatment in those instances
where employment of a family member or a member of the employee's household would be likely to raise questions regarding
the appropriateness of actions taken by the employee or the Corporation.

Section 3201.107&blank;Outside Employment and Other Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;3201.107(a) would prohibit an employee from providing services, for compensation, to an FDIC-insured
depository institution or to a person employed by such institution. The prohibition is based, in part, on 18 U.S.C.
1909, which prohibits an examiner from performing any service for compensation for any FDIC-insured depository
institution or for any person connected therewith. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, proposed &sect;3201.107(b) would restrict an employee from using certain professional licenses in
compensated outside activities when the employee's duties to the Corporation involve those activities. The areas
involved in the prohibition have been limited to areas identified as especially sensitive and critical to corporate
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;3201.107(c) would make it the responsibility of the employee to consult with an agency designee concerning
outside employment or activities that could result in disqualification of the employee from his or her official duties.

Section 3201.109&blank;Provisions of 5 CFR Part 2635 Not Applicable to Corporation Employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain provisions of the Standards of Ethical Conduct have been determined by the Corporation to be inapplicable
to its employees based on the Corporation's status as a mixed-ownership Corporation. To avoid confusion, the authorities
which are not applicable to the Corporation and its employees would be listed in &sect;3201.109 (b) through (e). Proposed
&sect;3201.109(a) would caution examiners that they may not use the gift exceptions in 5 CFR 2635.204 to accept a gift
that would violate the criminal prohibitions in 18 U.S.C. 213 against examiners accepting gifts or gratuities from
the institutions they examine.

On the effective date of the final rule, the Employee Responsibilities and Conduct regulation, 12 CFR part 336, will
be amended to remove and reserve subparts A, B, C, E, and F, &sect;&sect;336.1&hyph;336.23 and 336.29&hyph;336.37,
and remove the appendix to part 336. As proposed, a new &sect;336.1 will be added to provide a cross-reference to the
Corporation's supplemental ethical conduct regulation, to be codified at 5 CFR part 3201, the Corporation's supplemental
financial disclosure regulation at 5 CFR part 3202, and to the Executive Branch-wide financial disclosure and standards
of ethical conduct regulations at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635. 12 CFR part 336, subpart D, &sect;&sect;336.24 through
336.28, was removed and reserved by action of the Board of Directors of the Corporation dated November 24, 1992, 57
FR 39628.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An employee described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not participate in an examination, audit, visitation,

(3) Disqualification is not required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the credit was extended through the use of a credit card on the same terms and conditions as are offered to the general
public; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the agency designee, with the concurrence of the appropriate director, has authorized the employee to participate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retention and renegotiation of pre-existing extensions of credit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Nothing in this section prohibits the retention of a pre-existing extension of credit that an employee would be
prohibited from accepting by &sect;3201.102 (b) or (c) if the extension of credit was permitted to be retained under
12 CFR part 336 prior to the adoption of this regulation or if the employee's acceptance of the extension of credit was
proper at the time the obligation was incurred, as in the case of an extension of credit incurred prior to commencement
of employment or reassignment to another division or location. Subsequent action affecting the status of the creditor,
such as merger, acquisition, or transaction under 12 U.S.C. 1823, does not change the character of an extension of
credit that was proper when incurred. An employee who retains a pre-existing extension that he or she would be prohibited
from accepting by &sect;3201.102 (b) or (c) shall report the pre-existing extension of credit to the appropriate
director or agency designee within 30 days from the following event, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Adoption of this part; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Commencement of employment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Assignment to another division or location; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Action affecting the status of the creditor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any renegotiation of a pre-existing extension of credit shall be treated as a new extension of credit that is subject
to the prohibitions contained in &sect;3201.102 (b) through (d). An employee may request that an exception be made
to the prohibitions to permit renegotiation of a pre-existing extension of credit. Any such request shall be made
in writing to the appropriate director and agency designee, or in the case of an employee described in paragraph (b)(2)
(i) and (ii) of this section, to the Ethics Counselor, stating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The purpose of the renegotiation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The terms and conditions of the original extension of credit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The terms and conditions now available to the general public; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The terms and conditions now offered to the employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The action the employee has taken to move the loan to an institution from which an employee would not be prohibited
from accepting an extension of credit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The financial hardship, if any, denial of the request will cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After submission of the request, the appropriate director and agency designee, or the Ethics Counselor, may grant
the employee's request based upon a written determination that the request is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635
or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not
necessary to avoid the appearance of the misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence
in the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered.

(1) Acquiring, owning or controlling the securities of certain publicly traded bank holding companies or their nonbank
subsidiaries where the bank holding company is not primarily engaged in banking and either the bank holding company

Ethics Section); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Retaining a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution or an affiliate of an FDIC-insured depository
institution if the security was permitted to be retained by the employee under 12 CFR part 336 prior to the adoption
of this regulation, was obtained prior to commencement of employment with the Corporation, or was acquired by a spouse
prior to marriage to the employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Acquiring, owning, or controlling a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution or the affiliate of an

stock dividend, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate ownership, exercise of preemptive right, or otherwise
without specific intent to acquire the security. This provision permits the retention of any such interest only where:

employment or acquiring the interest; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The employee is disqualified in accordance with 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, from participating in any particular

interests held in the fund; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon a determination of substantial conflict under 5 CFR 2635.403(b), the Ethics Counselor may require an employee,
or the spouse or minor child of an employee, to divest a security he or she is otherwise authorized to retain under paragraph
(b) of this section.

shall not participate in the disposition of assets held in such capacities when the employee knows that any party with
whom the employee has a covered relationship, as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1), is or will be attempting to acquire
such assets. The employee shall provide written notification of the disqualification to his or her immediate supervisor

This proposed rule would invite comments extending PACA coverage to include fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables
that are oil-blanched, including frozen french fried potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of
these commodities suffered considerable financial losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the
PACA. This proposed rule would grant dealers in frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose
frozen product is water blanched.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulation, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under Section
1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would extend PACA coverage to include frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, especially
frozen french fried potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of these commodities suffered considerable
financial losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the PACA. This proposed rule would grant dealers
in frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose frozen product is water blanched.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PACA establishes a code of fair trading by prohibiting certain unfair practices in the marketing of fresh or frozen
fruits and vegetables. The law requires that parties fulfill their contractual obligations, and provides a forum
wherein persons who suffer damages can recover their losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PACA also impresses a statutory trust, for the benefit of unpaid sellers or suppliers, on all perishable agricultural
commodities received by a commission merchant, dealer or broker and all inventories of food or other products derived
from the sale of such commodities or products. Sellers who preserve their eligibility are entitled to payment ahead
of other creditors, from trust assets of money owed on past due accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in documents submitted to this Agency by the Frozen Potato Products Institute, frozen potato products
represent the largest single frozen commodity shipped in the United States. These documents further state that potatoes
cannot be economically frozen and shipped long distances unless they first undergo oil blanching. To exclude such
a substantial portion of the frozen food industry is inconsistent with the intent of the PACA to protect dealers in
fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie
Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracks in certain bolt
holes where certain parts of the main landing gear (MLG) are attached to the rear spar, and repair, if necessary. This
proposal is prompted by a report that cracks emanating from certain bolt holes in the rear spar were found during full
scale fatigue testing. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent unnecessary degradation
of the structural integrity of the airframe due to cracks in the rear spar.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Industrie Model A300&hyph;600 series
airplanes. The DGAC advised that, during full-scale fatigue testing, cracks were discovered in the rear spar emanating
from certain bolt holes where the main landing gear (MLG) forward pick-up fitting and the MLG rib 5 aft are attached
to the rear spar on Model A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could result in degradation
of the structural integrity of the airframe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300&hyph;57&hyph;6017, dated November 22, 1993, that describes
procedures for repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) rototest inspections to detect cracks in certain bolt
holes where the MLG forward pick-up fitting and the MLG rib 5 aft are attached to the rear spar. This service bulletin
also references Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A300&hyph;57&hyph;6020, dated November 22, 1993, as an additional
source of service information for accomplishment of certain repair and inspection procedures. The DGAC has classified
Airbus Service Bulletin A300&hyph;57&hyph;6017 as mandatory and has issued French airworthiness directive 94&hyph;031&hyph;155(B),
dated February 2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive HFEC rototest inspections to detect
cracks in certain bolt holes where the MLG forward pick-up fitting and the MLG rib 5 aft are attached to the rear spar,
and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to be accomplished in accordance with Airbus Industrie
Service Bulletin A300&hyph;57&hyph;6017.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
240 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions (including time to gain access and close up), and that
the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $330,000, or $13,200 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the proposed inspections and repair would require a large number of work
hours to accomplish. However, the compliance times in this proposed AD should allow ample time for the inspection
and repair to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities,
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to supersede two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing AD's that require repetitively inspecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal joints and universal rivets on British 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aerospace (BAe), Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing any damaged part, and limiting the in-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life of the torque tube shaft assembly. Jetstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft Limited has introduced an improved flap torque 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not life limited. The Federal Aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration's policy on aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-interval inspections when improved parts or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications are available. The proposed action would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require installing this improved flap torque shaft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent failure of the flap torque shaft assembly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of control of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries
an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number
of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences
of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as
the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4)
the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating
a known design change when it could eliminate, or, in certain instances, reduce the number of critical repetitive
inspections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR part 39) with an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to BAe, Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1,
Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes. This NPRM (56 FR 11976, March 21, 1991) proposed inspecting the flap
torque shaft to identify all Type ``F'' universal joints, and replacing these universal joints with Type ``M'' or
part number A16123 universal joints.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Jetstream Aircraft Limited has introduced an improved
flap torque shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporates the actions
proposed in the referenced NPRM and required by the following AD's:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;5529, which requires limiting the in-service life of the torque
tube shaft assembly on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;6273, which requires repetitively inspecting the universal
joints and universal joint rivets on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and replacing
any damaged part.

This service information specifies procedures for installing the improved flap torque shaft assembly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy and after reviewing all available information, the FAA has determined
that (1) installing the new improved flap torque shaft assemblies incorporates the actions proposed in the previously
referenced NPRM and AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, and replaces critical repetitive inspections
with a design modification; and (2) AD action should be taken to prevent failure of the flap torque shaft assembly,
which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and loss of control of the airplane. With this in mind, the FAA issued
a document, withdrawing the previously referenced NPRM, on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 8878, February 24, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other BAe, Regional Aircraft Limited,
HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede
both AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02 with a new AD that would require installing this improved flap
torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life limit requirements of the two existing AD's.
The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB No. 27&hyph;JA 920340.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subsequent final rule action (if promulgated) would have an effective date of 12 months after publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and a compliance time of 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date. This would allow operators time to schedule
the flap torque shaft assembly replacement. The requirements of AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02
would remain in effect until this date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 245 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately
31 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $1010 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $665,175. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane
operators have accomplished the proposed actions. In addition, this action would eliminate the repetitive inspections
required by AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02. The FAA has no way of determining the operation levels
of each individual operator of the affected airplanes, and subsequently cannot determine the repetitive inspections
costs that would be eliminated by the proposed action. The FAA estimates these costs to be substantial over the long-term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes to establish a Class E airspace area at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI. Presently,
this area is designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is operational. However, controlled
airspace to the surface is needed when the control tower located at this area is closed. The intended affect of this
proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when this control tower
is closed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated
control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Muskegon
County Airport, Muskegon, MI, when the control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intended affect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at this airport when the
control tower is closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations on sampling and testing of materials and construction appear in 23 CFR Part 637 (1993), Construction
Inspection and Approval. These regulations were last revised in January of 1987. The regulations were written around
the traditional approach of the State performing all the sampling and testing. The regulations do not address the
use of contractor testing. As a result, a number of questions arose in those States and Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) Federal Lands Highway offices which were using contractor testing in their quality control/quality assurance
(QC/QA) programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the existing regulations do not recognize the use of contractor testing results in the acceptance program,
which is the process of accepting materials and construction, an internal committee was established in 1992 to study
the ramifications of using contractor-performed sampling and testing results. The committee released the results
of its study in a report, ``Limits of Use of Contractor Performed Sampling and Testing,'' dated July 1, 1993. (A copy
of the report is available in the docket for inspection and copying.) One of the report's recommendations indicates
that contractor sampling and testing can be used in acceptance programs provided that adequate checks and balances
are in place to protect the public investment. The revisions that are proposed in this NPRM would implement the committee's
recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM, if promulgated, would replace the existing acceptance and independent assurance sampling and testing
programs with a comprehensive system of checks and balances. Acceptance of materials and construction would not
be based solely on any one set of data and would specifically require the State to monitor and inspect the contractors'
quality control program. The State's verification sampling and testing would be used to ensure the quality of the
product. In addition, the system would provide for using results from the contractors' quality control sampling
and testing program in the acceptance program if those results are validated by the State's verification sampling
and testing system. The verification sampling and testing would be performed on independent samples obtained by
the State to verify the contractors' quality control data. If the results from the contractors' quality control program
and the State's verification sampling and testing program do not agree a dispute resolution system will be used to
determine payment to the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for an independent assurance (IA) program would remain in place. The IA program would use witnessing,
split samples, proficiency samples and equipment calibration as an independent check of the field sampling and testing
procedures and equipment to assure the testing is being performed properly by both the State and the contractor personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major changes in the regulation would be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The use of contractor testing results in the overall acceptance program would be allowed, provided certain checks
and balances are in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The traditional type of acceptance program with the State performing all of the testing would be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The IA program could be performed either on a system basis or on a project by project basis. In a system approach, all
equipment and testing personnel would be assessed on a time frequency, regardless of the specific project on which
the testing occurs. The system approach would allow the State to assess testing equipment and testing personnel regardless
of project location. This approach would ensure that the testing on small projects is assessed and would also ensure
that all testing personnel are reviewed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. If the system approach to the IA program is used, an annual report on the IA program would be required instead of a statement
in the project materials certificate concerning the IA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Qualified, designated agents of the State would be permitted to perform the IA testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All testing personnel and laboratories would be required to be qualified using State procedures. It is anticipated
this provision will have an effective date two years after the publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The State Highway Agency's (SHA) central laboratory would be required to become accredited by the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Accreditation Program. It is also anticipated this provision
will have an effective date two years after the publication of the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The
FHWA, at 23 CFR 637, currently has regulations covering sampling and testing. The proposed revisions would merely
update these regulations to accommodate contractor-performed sampling and testing and reinforce existing policy.
Therefore, it is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal and a full regulatory evaluation
is not required.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this
proposal on small entities. The FHWA concluded that this action would in fact provide some small testing firms with
an opportunity to perform more work than was allowed by the previous regulations. Although the regulation would have
a positive impact on these testing firms, the number of firms affected would be small and the amount of additional work
would be insignificant. Therefore, the FHWA hereby certifies that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires that for any petition to revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that contains
substantial scientific and commercial information a finding be made within 12 months of the date of receipt of the
petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii) warranted, or (iii) warranted but precluded
by other efforts to revise the lists, and expeditious progress is being made in listing and delisting species. Notice
of the finding is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This notice meets the latter requirement for the 12-month finding made earlier for the petition discussed below.
Information contained in this notice is a summary of the information in the 12-month finding, which is the Service's
decision document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A petition dated September 30, 1992, was received from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Dr. Shi-Kuei Wu of the
University of Colorado on October 5, 1992. The petitioners requested the Service to emergency list the Rocky Mountain
capshell (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acroloxus coloradensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered and to designate critical habitat concurrently with the listing. The petitioners submitted biological,
distributional, historical, and other information and scientific references in support of the petition. The notice
of a 90-day finding was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28543), indicating that the petitioners provided substantial information to warrant the requested
action. Concurrent with publishing the notice, the Service initiated a status review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the 90-day finding was completed, the Rocky Mountain capshell was thought to be restricted to only two populations
in the United States and five in Canada. In the United States, one population existed at Peterson Lake, Boulder County,
Colorado, and the other at Glacier National Park in Montana. In Canada, the Rocky Mountain capshell was known to occur
in three lakes in Quebec and two ponds in Ontario. The species was presumed extirpated from two lakes in Jasper National
Park, Alberta (Clarke 1992a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the summer of 1993, an extensive survey effort in Colorado increased the number of known Rocky Mountain capshell
populations in Colorado from one to five, with four of these populations apparently in ``good health'' and occurring
on National Park Service or U.S. Forest Service lands (Pioneer Environmental Services 1993, Riebesell and Kovalak
1993). The fifth population is located on privately owned land and appears to be the only Colorado population that
is in peril. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A status survey conducted at Lost Lake, Montana in September 1992 found that Rocky Mountain capshell population to
be stable. This population is estimated to contain between 20,000 and 40,000 individuals, based on the number of snails
found per square meter and the amount of available habitat (A.H. Clark, Ecosearch Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New information provided by Jasper National Park personnel in Canada indicates at least one Rocky Mountain capshell
population still exists within the Park and there is the likelihood a second population (N. Manners, Jasper National
Park, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). A few specimens were also found under a bridge in another area outside the Park in 1991 (Paul and Clifford, 1991).
Thus, Alberta appears to harbor at least two, and possibly three, Rocky Mountain capshell populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A previously unreported Rocky Mountain capshell population appears to occur at Purden Lake, British Columbia (Clarke
1992b). However, the Service has been unable to obtain any information on its population status. The three populations
previously reported to occur in Quebec and the two in Ontario apparently still exist, but the status of each population
is not known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the discovery of 4 new populations in Colorado, 1 in Alberta, and 1 in British Columbia, and the possibility of
1 or 2 populations still existing in Jasper National Park, the number of reported Rocky Mountain capshell populations
has increased from 7 to at least 14 in less than 1 year.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following information is a summary and discussion of the five factors or listing criteria as set forth in section
4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act and
their applicability to the current status of the Rocky Mountain capshell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Peterson Lake, Colorado, population may be nearly extirpated and a survey in June found only three live specimens
and one empty shell after 12 hours of intensive searching (Clarke 1992a). Subsequent surveys found a few more individuals,
some were at deeper depths than found previously (Pioneer Environmental Services 1993; G. Hopkins, Pioneer Environmental
Services, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities which might have caused the decline of the population in Peterson Lake include road maintenance (salting/sanding
and grading), ski resort activities (water depletion and treated waste water discharge into the lake), landscaping,
mining, lake drawdowns, and dam raising which resulted in the subsequent flooding of the enlarged lake basin. Since
the present management of Eldora Mountain Resort took over operation of the ski area in 1991, the water quality of the
lake has improved. Present information indicates that the species may again be increasing due to an improvement in
the water quality of the lake. Future surveys will be necessary to verify this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aside from the population at Peterson Lake, none of the other 13 remaining populations are thought to be significantly
impacted by the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the lakes inhabited by the Rocky Mountain capshell receive fishing, camping, and swimming activities, but
this factor is not thought to be a threat to the continued existence of the Rocky Mountain capshell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Disease or Predation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The introduction of trout may have been one of the factors that contributed to the decline of the Rocky Mountain capshell
in Peterson Lake. Aside from this population, disease or predation is presently not a threat to any of the other 13 Rocky
Mountain capshell populations.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service believes that the four newly discovered populations in Colorado are safe from human impacts since they
occur on National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The population in Glacier National Park is protected by Park Service regulations. With the exception of the one or
two populations within Jasper National Park, the Canadian populations apparently do not have any regulatory protection.
The lack of regulatory mechanisms is not known to be a threat at this time, but could change at some point in the future.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At Peterson Lake, severe drought coupled with the winter water drawdown form the lake by Eldora Ski Resort, has on occasion
lowered the water level dramatically. These events have exposed the Rocky Mountain capshell to dehydration and freezing
conditions. In 1979, the existing access road adjacent to Peterson Lake was paved. This expedited runoff, thus increased
the natural sedimentation process plus adding an influx of possible salt and sand contaminants into the lake.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the 90-day finding was made, the Service believed that the two populations in Jasper National Park had been extirpated
due to the lakes they inhabited being poisoned. However, new information has shown that neither lake was poisoned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rocky Mountain capshell population in Peterson Lake may be threatened by natural or manmade factors, but none
of the other 13 known populations are thought to be threatened by any of these factors.

Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Emergency listing is allowed under the Act whenever immediate protection is needed to prevent extirpation of a species.
For an invertebrate species, endangerment must be considered throughout the range of the species rather than for
a single population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering information previously discussed in this notice, only the Peterson Lake population of the 14 known Rocky
Mountain capshell populations is thought to be subject to possible endangerment or extinction in the foreseeable
future. Also, in less than one year's time, the number of reported populations increased from 7 to 14. Since little
is known about the biology, ecology, and distribution of the Rocky Mountain capshell, and since recently discovered
populations in Colorado, Alberta, and British Columbia point to a wider geographical distribution than previously
thought, the Service believes that additional populations exist in suitable habitat in the United States and in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the petition, accompanying documentation, references cited therein, and research findings, the
Service concludes that the petition requesting that the Rocky Mountain capshell be listed as an endangered species
on an emergency basis throughout its range is not warranted. The petitioners also requested that critical habitat
be designated. In the future, if a warranted finding is made for the species, then designation of critical habitat
would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule. After arriving at the not warranted finding, the Service changed
the species' candidate status from category 2 to category 3C.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter the Service) is proposing to establish the 1994&hyph;95 early-season
hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds. The Service annually prescribes frameworks, or outer limits,
for dates and times when hunting may occur and the maximum number of birds that may be taken and possessed in early seasons.
These frameworks are necessary to allow State selections of final seasons and limits and to allow recreational harvest
at levels compatible with population status and habitat conditions.

 to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these
species and for other early seasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document is the third in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for migratory bird
hunting regulations and deals specifically with proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. It will lead
to final frameworks from which States may select season dates, shooting hours, and daily bag and possession limits
for the 1994&hyph;95 season. All pertinent comments received through June 23, 1994, have been considered in developing
this document. In addition, new proposals for certain early-season regulations are provided for public comment.
Comment periods are specified above under

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four Service employees presented reports on the status of various migratory bird species for which early hunting
seasons are being proposed. These reports are briefly reviewed as a matter of public information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. John Bruggink, Woodcock Specialist, reported on the 1994 status of American woodcock. Age-ratio information
from harvested woodcock indicated that the 1993 recruitment index (ratio of immatures to adult females) was 23.5
percent below the long-term average in the Eastern Region and 11.8 percent lower than the long-term average in the
Central Region. Daily hunting success in the Eastern Region decreased from 2.0 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1992
to 1.9 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1993 (&hyph;5 percent). The seasonal-hunting-success index decreased from
9.7 to 7.0 woodcock per hunter (&hyph;27.8 percent). In the Central Region, the daily-success index decreased from
2.4 birds per hunter in 1992 to 2.3 birds per hunter in 1993 (&hyph;4.2 percent), and the seasonal success index decreased
from 11.7 to 11.0 woodcock bagged per hunter (&hyph;6 percent). Analysis of data from the Singing-ground Survey indicated
that the number of woodcock declined between 1993 and 1994 in the Eastern and Central Regions. Ten-year (1985&hyph;94)
trends from the Singing-ground Survey also indicated declining populations. Since 1968, breeding population indices
declined 1.9 percent per year in the Eastern Region and 1.1 percent per year in the Central Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. David Dolton, Dove Specialist, presented the status of mourning doves in 1994. The report summarized call-count
information gathered over the past 29 years. Trends were calculated for the most recent 10&hyph;year interval and
for the entire 29&hyph;year period. Between 1993 and 1994, the average number of doves heard per route did not significantly
change in any of the 3 management units. No significant trend was found in doves heard in the Eastern or Central Units
for either the 10&hyph; or 29&hyph;year time frames. In the Western Unit, no trend was evident over the most recent
10 years, but there has been a significant decline over the past 29 years. Trends for doves seen at the unit level over
the 10&hyph; and 29&hyph;year periods agreed with trends for doves heard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Dolton also presented the status of western white-winged doves in Arizona. Whitewing populations declined rapidly
in the 1970's, and have since remained relatively stable at a reduced level. In 1993, the Arizona whitewing harvest
of 91,000 birds declined 3.7 percent from the harvest in 1992 and was 30 percent below the 1980&hyph;89 mean. The 1994
whitewing call-count survey indicated an 18 percent decrease from 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Dolton then reported on the status of eastern white-winged doves and white-tipped doves in Texas. Results of the
1994 whitewing call-count survey indicated that 615,000 birds were nesting in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Starr,
Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy Counties. This estimate represents a 40 percent increase from 1993 and is 22 percent
above the 33-year average of 501,000. In upper south Texas, more than 577,000 whitewings were nesting throughout
a 19&hyph;county area. This is a 20 percent increase over last year's population and marks the sixth year of a population
expansion in this portion of the State. West Texas supports a small population of whitewings. The 1994 estimate of
17,000 birds was 10 percent below the 1993 estimate. For white-tipped doves, an average of 0.78 birds were heard per
stop in both brush and citrus locations in 1994. This is 30 percent below the 1993 level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Mr. Dolton presented population and harvest information for band-tailed pigeons. This species is managed
as two separate populations: the Coastal Population (California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) and the Four-Corners
or Interior Population (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah). For the Coastal Population, the Breeding Bird Survey
(BBS) indicated a significant decline between 1968 and 1993. However, the population apparently has stabilized
in the 9 years from 1985 to 1993. Mineral-spring counts conducted in Oregon suggest that bandtails experienced a precipitous
decline in 1973 and again in 1985. Since 1985, these counts indicate that the population has been increasing gradually,
but it remains at a lower level than during the 1970's. The 1993 count decreased 1.6 percent from 1992. Washington's
call-count survey yielded a 1993 index 44 percent above that of 1992, although this change was not statistically significant.
Two indirect population estimates in 1992 suggested that the population ranged between 2.4 and 3.1 million birds.
The estimated harvest in 1993 was 6,000 birds in California and 3,200 in Oregon. Washington did not have a bandtail
season in 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Four-Corners area, BBS data indicated a stable population between 1968 and 1993. The combined harvest for all
four States in 1993 was 828 birds. This was a decrease of 60 percent from more than 2,000 bandtails harvested in 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Jim Dubovsky, Waterfowl Specialist, presented information on 1994 habitat conditions for waterfowl and preliminary
estimates of blue-winged teal abundance and harvests. A video was shown depicting wetland and upland conditions
in the Dakotas and the Prairie Provinces of Canada. Generally, nesting conditions were favorable throughout most
of the survey area, with abundant wetlands and improved upland cover. Biologists in several regions stated that conditions
were the best they have observed since the 1970's. There were approximately 6 million ponds in Prairie Canada and the
northcentral U.S. This estimate is significantly greater than the estimate for 1993 and the long-term average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 May breeding population survey yielded an estimate of 4.6 million blue-winged teal, 45 percent higher than
the 1993 estimate of 3.2 million. The 1994 estimate was also 14 percent above the long-term average. The estimated
harvest of blue-winged teal during the 1993 September teal season was approximately 134,000 birds, 30 percent below
the outcome of the 1992 teal season. The combined September and regular-season harvest of all teal was approximately
1.03 million, 42 percent below the 1985&hyph;87 average. Harvest rates of blue-winged teal remained low during 1993&hyph;94
and were not different from those of last year or the 1985&hyph;87 period.

Mr. David Sharp, Central Flyway Representative, reported on the status and harvests of sandhill cranes. The Mid-Continent
Population appears to have stabilized following dramatic increases in the early 1980's. The preliminary 1994 spring
index for the Central Platte River Valley, uncorrected for visibility, was about 384,850. This index is 52 percent
larger than the 1993 index of 253,800. The photo-corrected 3&hyph;year average for the 1991&hyph;93 period was 375,300,
which is within the established population-objective range of 343,000&hyph;465,000 cranes. All Central Flyway
States, except Nebraska, elected to allow crane hunting in portions of their respective States in 1993&hyph;94;
about 19,000 permits were issued and approximately 7,200 permittees hunted one or more times. Compared to the previous
year's seasons, the number of permittees increased about 10 percent and active hunters increased 35 percent. About
19,000 cranes were harvested in 1993&hyph;94, a 53 percent increase from the 12,433 harvested in 1992&hyph;93. In
Canada, the retrieved harvest fell (51%) from 5,600 in the 1992&hyph;93 seasons to 2,800 in the 1993&hyph;94 seasons.
Also, Mid-Continent cranes are hunted in Alaska and Mexico. Data for these areas are not yet available, but the combined
harvest should not exceed 3,500 during the 1993&hyph;94 seasons. The total North American sport harvest was estimated
to be about 30,200 cranes, which is near (&hyph;5%) the record high reported in the 1990&hyph;91 seasons (31,700),
and only the second time the total has exceeded the 30,000 level.

Annual surveys of the Rocky Mountain Population, which migrates through the San Luis Valley of Colorado in March,
suggest that the population has been relatively stable since 1984. The 1994 index of 17,214 cranes (uncorrected for
visibility bias) was near the established objective range of 18,000&hyph;22,000. Limited special seasons were
held during 1993 in portions of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, and resulted in an estimated harvest
of 704 cranes.

Mr. Charles D. Kelley, representing the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, reiterated the
request made by a majority of States in the Southeast to prohibit dove hunting over top-sown wheat and urged the Service
to include this prohibition in its final revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR). He also expressed opposition
to the proposed inclusion of wounded birds in the daily bag limit.

Mr. Ron Stromstad, representing the Central Flyway Council and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, stated
that he appreciated the work of the Service Regulations Committee in developing this year's annual hunting-season
proposals. He indicated that the Central Flyway Council looked forward to working with the recently established
Mid-Continent Population Sandhill Crane Working Group to revise the harvest strategy for this population. He supported
the Central Flyway Council's recommendations regarding the conduct of September teal seasons and emphasized that
evaluation of any proposed changes to these seasons should be undertaken on a flyway basis. He supported the Texas
request for dove hunting during 3 time periods in the Central and Southern Zones. He appreciated the proposed change
in the aggregate bag limit for white-winged doves from 2 to 6 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. He noted that over the past
3 years, whitewings have expanded their range and populations have grown significantly. In the Rio Grande Valley,
numbers are now well above average. With regard to the proposed revision of 50 CFR, he encouraged the Service to proceed
slowly in the development of the proposed rule and suggested that the Service continue to work closely with the States.
He supported the recommendations from the other Flyway Councils, with the exception of the proposed changes in the
woodcock season in Tennessee. He emphasized that the record should clearly indicate that the Conservation Reserve
Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is providing secure nesting habitats for grassland-nesting
migratory birds. Improved water conditions on the prairies, coupled with the millions of acres of secure nesting
cover, will undoubtedly have a significant beneficial effect on this year's recruitment of nesting birds in the northcentral
States.

 (58 FR 37830), the Service reiterated that, consistent with the strategy for the use of shooting hours developed by
the Service in 1990, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise
shooting hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. States will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours
during their September seasons under the condition that they conduct studies or provide information that demonstrates
a negligible impact on nontarget duck species during the one-half hour period prior to sunrise. Three States in the
Mississippi Flyway (Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) and five in the Central Flyway (Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas,
Kansas, and New Mexico) conducted hunter observations during the 1993 September teal season that demonstrated that
the attempted harvest of non-target species was no different between pre- and post-sunrise periods.

A cooperative Wood Duck Initiative undertaken by the Service and the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils in
1991 is designed to improve banding programs and evaluate techniques for obtaining estimates of breeding population
size and production. The Service does not propose to discontinue the September wood duck/teal seasons in Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Florida or expand seasons elsewhere until this initiative has been completed. Furthermore, the Service
requests an updated report on these seasons for Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida, by February 1, 1995. These reports
should contain wood duck recovery and survival rates, harvest, and the derivation of banded birds harvested during
these seasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has published a strategy concerning shooting hours which indicates that during species-specific duck
seasons, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise shooting
hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. The Service received information from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida
regarding the effect of presunrise shooting hours. This information was deemed sufficient to demonstrate a negligible
impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species during seasons directed at both teal and wood ducks.
Therefore, Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours during their
September seasons without further evaluation.

the Service reiterates its request that the Flyway Councils continue to review the status of sea ducks and complete
management plans. States are asked to participate in improving population surveys, harvest estimates, and production
indices.

 The Michigan Department of Natural Resources believes that regular goose seasons should be allowed to open as early
as September 24 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving
in the Upper Peninsula during September 20&hyph;24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would
remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region
are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24
opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region
by early November.

In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent
Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during
the 1982&hyph;92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service
believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically
discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of data collection efforts at the subspecies
level. In the April 9, 1993,

of Mid-Continent Sandhill Cranes and especially the greater sandhill crane component. They noted that the Central
Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons and asked for clarification of
the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that
the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore,
the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies
level. Biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level. They indicated
that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended removal of restrictive bag limits for white-fronted geese in Units 1&hyph;9
and 14&hyph;18 in Alaska. The goose limit will be 6 daily and 12 in possession, of which no more than 4 daily and 8 in possession
could be any combination of Canada or white-fronted geese.

Public Comment Invited

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress and having due consideration for any data or views
submitted by interested parties, the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemaking will specify
open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits for designated migratory game birds in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service intends that adopted final rules be as responsive as possible to all concerned interests, and therefore
solicits the comments and suggestions of the public, other concerned governmental agencies, and private interests
on these proposals. Such comments, and any additional information received, may lead to final regulations that differ
from these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulations which limit the amount of time that
the Service can allow for public comment. Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemaking
process must operate: (1) the need to establish final rules at a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State
agencies to appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms; and (2) the unavailability before
mid-June of specific, reliable data on this year's status of some waterfowl and migratory shore and upland game bird
populations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow comment periods past the dates specified is contrary
to the public interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written comments to the
Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 634, Arlington Square, Washington,
DC 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Service's
office in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. All relevant comments
received during the comment period will be considered. The Service will attempt to acknowledge comments received,
but substantive responses to individual comments may not be provided.

The Division of Endangered Species is completing a biological opinion on the proposed action. As in the past, hunting
regulations this year will be designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons
for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species. The Service's
biological opinions resulting from consultations under Section 7 are considered public documents and are available
for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species (room 432) and the Office of Migratory Bird Management (room
634), Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete regulations which govern the terms and conditions under
which forest products produced by Indian tribal forest enterprises from the forests of Indian Reservations may be
sold. The BIA is proposing to delete these regulations because the ``General Forest Regulations,'' prescribe a similar
policy for sales of Indian forest products in the section, ``Indian Tribal Forest Enterprise Operations.'' Therefore,
the proposed deletion is necessary to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion in forestry program regulations.

 This action, deleting 25 CFR part 164, results from the BIA's need to eliminate the redundancy and potential confusion
arising from having two regulations governing the same operation in the 25 CFR Indian forestry program regulations.
The BIA recognizes that provisions in &sect;163.13 of the revision of 25 CFR part 163, ``General Forest Regulations,''
are adequate to govern the sale of Indian forest products and, as a result, that 25 CFR part 164 is no longer needed.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete regulations which govern the terms and conditions under
which forest products produced by the Red Lake Indian Mills may be sold. The BIA is proposing to delete these regulations
because the Red Lake Indian Mills no longer exists and the revision of the ``General Forest Regulations,'' prescribes
policy for the sale of forest products produced by other Indian forest product enterprises on the Red Lake Indian Reservation.
Therefore, this proposed deletion is necessary to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion in forestry program
regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The bald eagle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act) in the lower 48 States, except Washington,
Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where it is listed as threatened. The bald eagle also occurs in Alaska
and Canada, where it is not at risk and is not protected under the Act, and exists in small numbers in northern Mexico.
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the
lower 48 States except in certain portions of the American Southwest and to classify those eagles in adjacent Mexico
as endangered. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five States where it is currently listed as threatened.
The special rule for threatened bald eagles would be revised. This action would not alter those conservation measures
already in force to protect the species and its habitats. The Service seeks comments from the public on this proposed
reclassification.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Literally translated, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means white-headed sea eagle. This large, powerful brown bird with a white head and tail is well known as our Nation's
symbol. Young bald eagles are mostly dark brown until they reach 4 to 6 years in age and may be confused with the golden
eagle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aquila chrysaetos
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The bald eagle is the only sea eagle regularly occurring on the North American continent (American Ornithologists'
Union 1983). Its range extends from central Alaska and Canada to northern Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bald eagle is a bird of aquatic ecosystems (Marshall and Nickerson 1976). It frequents estuaries, large lakes,
reservoirs, major rivers, and some seacoast habitats. However, such areas must have an adequate food base, perching
areas, and nesting sites meeting certain requirements to support bald eagles. In winter, bald eagles often congregate
at specific wintering sites that are generally close to open water and that offer good perch trees and night roosts.
Bald eagle habitats encompass both public and private lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bald eagle was first described in 1766 as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Falco leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by Linnaeus. This South Carolina bird was later renamed as the southern bald eagle, subspecies 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Linnaeus), when, in 1897, Townsend identified the northern bald eagle as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus alascanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (American Ornithologists' Union 1957). These two subspecific names were in use when the southern bald eagle (arbitrarily
declared to occur south of the 40th parallel) was listed (March 11, 1967; 32 FR 4001) as endangered under the Endangered
Species Protection Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668aa&hyph;668cc). By the time the bald eagle was listed (February 14, 1978;
43 FR 6233) for the entire lower 48 States, the subspecies were no longer recognized by ornithologists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bald eagle historically ranged throughout North America except extreme northern Alaska and Canada and central
and southern Mexico. Bald eagles nest on both coasts from Florida to Baja California, in the south, and from Labrador
to the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, in the north (formerly to the Commander Islands, western Bering Sea). In
many of these areas they were abundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gerrard and Bortolotti (1988) describe early population trends. When Europeans first arrived on the North American
continent, there were an estimated quarter- to a half-million bald eagles. The first major decline in the bald eagle
population probably began in the mid to late 1800's. It coincided with declines in numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds
and other major prey species. Direct eagle killing was also prevalent, and, coupled with loss of nesting habitat,
these factors reduced bald eagle numbers until the 1940's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1940, the Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668) was passed. This law prohibits the take, possession, sale, purchase,
barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald eagle, alive or dead, including
any part, nest, or egg, unless allowed by permit; ``take'' includes pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill,
capture, trap, collect, or molest or disturb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bald Eagle Protection Act and increased public awareness of the bald eagle resulted in a partial recovery or a slower
decline of the species in most areas of the country. However, persecution continued, notably in Alaska, which was
exempted from the Bald Eagle Protection Act and maintained a bounty on bald eagles. In 1952, after lengthy studies
demonstrated that bald eagles were not affecting salmon numbers, Alaska was no longer exempted.

Shortly after World War II, the use of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and other organochlorine compounds
became widespread. Initially, DDT was sprayed extensively along coastal and other wetland areas to control mosquitos
(Carson 1962). Later it was used as a general insecticide. As DDT accumulated in individual bald eagles from ingesting
contaminated food, the species' reproduction plummeted. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was determined that
dichlorophenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE), the principal metabolite of DDT, accumulated in the fatty tissues of the
adult females and impaired calcium release for egg shell formation, thus inducing thin shells and reproductive failure.

In response to the decline following World War II, on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001), the Secretary of the Interior listed
bald eagles south of the 40th parallel as endangered under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. The northern
bald eagle was not included in that action primarily because the Alaskan and Canadian populations were not considered
endangered in 1967. On December 31, 1972, DDT was banned from use in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1973, the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was passed. Among other provisions, it allowed the listing of distinct populations of animal species and the addition
of a new category, ``threatened.'' The Act defines an endangered species as a species that is in danger of extinction
throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is defined as any species that is likely
to become an endangered species (but is not in danger of extinction) throughout all or a significant portion of its
range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A nationwide bald eagle survey by the Service and a number of other agencies and conservation groups in 1974 revealed
that, in parts of the northern half of the lower 48 States, bald eagle populations and reproductive success were lower
than in certain southern areas. Thus, in 1978, the Service listed the bald eagle, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (no subspecies referenced) throughout the lower 48 States as endangered except in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Washington, and Oregon, where it was designated as threatened (February 14, 1978; 43 FR 6233). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restoring endangered and threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again viable, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is the main goal of the Endangered Species Act. Thus, the Act contains recovery as well
as listing and protection provisions. To effect recovery, section 4(f) of the Act provides for the development and
implementation of recovery plans for listed species. According to the Act, a recovery plan is a plan for the conservation
and survival of the species. It identifies, describes, and schedules the actions necessary to restore endangered
and threatened species to a more secure biological condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing a recovery program for the species in the mid-1970s, the Service divided the bald eagles of the lower
48 States into five recovery populations, based on geographic location, termed Recovery Regions. A recovery plan
was prepared for each population by separate recovery teams composed of species experts in each geographic area.
The teams set forth goals for recovery and identified tasks to achieve those goals. Coordination meetings were held
regularly among the five teams to exchange data and other information. The five recovery regions and the dates of their
approved recovery plans are as follows: Chesapeake Bay (1982, revised 1990); Pacific (1986); Southeastern (1984,
revised 1989); Northern States (1983); and Southwestern (1982). The last two plans are under active revision and
expected to be available for public review within the next 12 months. Many of the tasks described within these recovery
plans have been funded and carried out by the Service and other Federal, State, and private organizations. Annual
expenditures for the recovery and protection of the bald eagle by public and private agencies have exceeded $1 million
each year for the past decade (Service files). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 16 years since it was listed throughout the conterminous 48 States, the bald eagle population has clearly improved.
The improvement is a direct result of the banning of DDT and other persistent organochlorines and from recovery efforts.
In 1963, a National Audubon Society survey reported only 417 active nests in the lower 48 States, with an average of
0.59 young produced per active nest. In 1993, about 4,000 occupied breeding areas were reported by the States with
an estimated average young per occupied territory of 0.93. Compared to 1974, for example, the number of occupied breeding
areas in the lower 48 States has increased by 408 percent, and since 1990, there has been a 32 percent increase. The species
is doubling its breeding population every 6&hyph;7 years since the late 1970s.

The Act requires periodic review of the status of listed species. The Service has reviewed the status of the bald eagle
and is proposing reclassification in all or portions of four Recovery Regions. The review recognized the achievement
of specific recovery plan reclassification goals. The biological basis for the recovery goals is described in each
recovery plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recovery plans were first approved in the early 1980's. The five Recovery Regions are illustrated on the following

A summary follows of each Recovery Region's reclassification and delisting goals, an estimation of progress to date
in achieving those goals, and proposed Service action. The terms ``occupied breeding areas'' and ``occupied territories''
are used interchangeably. Either term indicates that a pair of bald eagles has established a breeding territory and
a nest site but was not necessarily successful in producing young. All numbers are based upon known eagle nests and
not estimates; surveys, particularly those before the late 1970s, miss some pairs, so all counts are considered minimums.

Threatened Goals: Sustaining 175&hyph;250 breeding pairs with a productivity level of 1.1 young per active nest,
concurrent with sustained progress in habitat protection measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delisting Goals: Sustaining 300&hyph;400 pairs with an average productivity of 1.1 young per active nest over 5 years
with permanent protection of sufficient habitat to support this nesting population and enough roosting and foraging
habitat to support population levels commensurate with increases throughout the Atlantic coastal area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Progress to Date: 329 reported occupied breeding areas and 1.12 young per occupied area in 1993. Progress in habitat
protection has been sustained and additional habitat is being protected. There have been in excess of 175 known occupied
breeding areas since 1988; 1992 was the first year in which there were more than 300. Threatened goals have been met,
delisting goals have not.

Threatened Goals: No goal for reclassification to threatened status in present plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delisting Goals: 1,200 occupied breeding areas over a minimum of 16 States with an average annual productivity of
at least 1.0 young per occupied nest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Progress to Date: In 1993, there were 1602 known occupied breeding areas distributed over 21 States with 0.95 young
per occupied breeding area. Productivity was 1.00 in 1990, 0.97 in 1991, and 1.01 in 1992. (Productivity estimates
exclude nest data from Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1992, and from Wisconsin in 1990 and 1991, because there were no productivity
surveys done in these States during those years.) Delisting goals have been met for occupied breeding areas and are
close to being met for productivity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened; the species would remain threatened where it now has that status. The
recovery plan describes the delisting goals as initial and tentative. The Northern States Bald Eagle Recovery Team
has reconvened for the purpose of reviewing the plan and revising the goals, if necessary.

Threatened Goals: Nesting populations continue to increase annually for the 5 years beginning with 1986 nesting
season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delisting Goals: A minimum of 800 nesting pairs with an average reproductive rate of 1.0 fledged young per pair with
an average success rate per occupied site of not less than 65% over a 5-year period. Attainment of breeding population
goals should be met in at least 80% of management zones. Wintering populations should be stable or increasing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Progress to Date: In 1993, 1066 occupied breeding areas were reported with 0.86 young per occupied breeding area.
The number of occupied breeding areas has consistently increased since 1986 and exceeded 800 for 4 of the 5 years beginning
in 1990 when 861 were reported. Productivity has averaged about 1.0 since 1990. Threatened goals have been met. Should
this trend continue, the delisting goals for number of nesting pairs and productivity may be met in the near future.
At present, less than 80 percent of the 37 specified management zones have met their delisting goals. In 1993, 20 of
those zones had met or exceeded their recovery goals, and four other zones in addition to the original 37 had nesting
eagles that are not part of the recovery goals for this region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Threatened goals have been met. Delisting goals are close to being met for all criteria except attainment of breeding
population goals for 80 percent of the management zones. About 10 more zones need to meet their goals to fulfill this
criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened in California (except the 10-mile strip along the Colorado River), Idaho,

Threatened Goals: 600 occupied breeding areas distributed over at least 75 percent of the historic range contingent
upon greater than 0.9 young per occupied nest, greater than 1.5 young per successful nest, and at least 50 percent of
the nests successful in raising at least one young; based on a 3-year average and documentation of population vigor
and adequate support habitat. Individual State goals are given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delisting Goals: Delisting may be considered if the recovery trend continues for 5 years after reclassification
goals are met. The criteria for delisting will be developed when the species is reclassified from endangered to threatened.

Progress to Date: 982 occupied breeding areas were reported with an average of 1.02 young per occupied territory in
1993. Nesting is distributed over all 11 Southeastern States. The number of occupied breeding areas reached 601 in
1991 and has exceeded 600 for three successive years. Reproductive success for the years 1990&hyph;1993 averaged
1.53 young per successful nest (or 1.04 young per occupied territory), and 68 percent of the nests were successful
in raising at least one young. Seven of eleven individual State goals have been met but these are considered guidelines
rather than requirements. Existing habitat is deemed to be adequate to support and exceed overall recovery plan goals.
Threatened goals have been met and delisting goals will be met in 5 years if the trend continues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Threatened Goals: 10&hyph;12 young per year over a 5-year period; population range has to expand to include one or
more river drainages in addition to the Salt and Verde Systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delisting Goals: None given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Progress to Date: 29 occupied breeding areas were reported for 1993 with 27 young produced. Since 1988, the number
of occupied breeding areas has increased by about 26 percent (six occupied territories) in the Southwestern Region.
Nationwide, occupied breeding areas have increased by 62 percent (1540 occupied territories) in the same time period.
Some of the increase in the Southwestern Region is due to finding previously unrecorded nest sites. Ten or more young
have been produced every year since 1981. Productivity has increased 10&hyph;20 percent through the assistance
of the Arizona Nest Watch program (Hunt et al. 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information to date indicates that breeding has expanded beyond the Salt and Verde River systems. Eagles are now nesting
in the Gila and Bill Williams river systems in Arizona and the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Thus, the threatened criteria
have been fully met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The population remains small, localized, with variable productivity, and low adult survival. This population faces
numerous and increasing impacts from a rapidly growing human population. These impacts include continued loss and
modification of riparian habitat, disturbance at nest sites, entanglement of nestlings in fish line, and other human-caused
influences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Southwestern Recovery Plan is undergoing revision to incorporate new information gained from recent investigations
by Hunt et al. (1992). This research indicates that birds dispersing into west Texas and Oklahoma are more likely to
be bald eagles of the Southeastern Region population than those of the Southwestern Region. Thus, the revised recovery
plan may propose the elimination of west Texas and the western panhandle of Oklahoma from the Southwestern Recovery
Region. The plan revision will also consider the addition of southern Utah and Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this reclassification proposal, however, the boundaries for the Southwestern Recovery Region
will remain as stated in the recovery plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1982). That is, the Southwestern Region
includes Arizona, New Mexico, and those portions of Texas and Oklahoma west of the 100th meridian, and southeast California
within 10 miles of the Colorado River or its mainstem reservoirs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service Action: Retain as endangered. Despite attaining all recovery plan goals, current information indicates
that the population is at risk and remains in danger of extinction due to excessively low survival rates and the need
for intensive management, particularly at nest sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Mexico
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are a small number of eagles nesting in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico. In January 1994, a minimum of eight
active pairs were known with additional adults reported that may represent more active pairs with undetected nests
(Henny et al. 1993, Service files). Productivity has been relatively high with more than 1.0 young per nest for those
years that data have been collected (Henny et al. 1993, Service files). Although this population appears to be relatively
stable, such low numbers are clearly not sufficient to prevent any sudden adverse environmental change to cause the
extirpation of these few pairs. These birds are presumed to be associated with the Southwestern population and are
considered in danger of extinction. Threats to these birds include loss of habitat and disturbance from human encroachment
with the increasing population (particularly tourists and recreational housing development) and potential for
inbreeding from such low numbers of breeding birds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Service is proposing to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the Chesapeake
and Southeastern Recovery Regions and those portions of the Northern States and Pacific Recovery Regions where it
is currently classified as endangered. No changes are proposed for the Southwestern Recovery Region, where the bald
eagle will remain classified as endangered. The Service is not proposing to delist the bald eagle anywhere in the lower
48 States at this time. The Service is also proposing to list those bald eagles in Mexico as endangered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 7, 1990, the Service published (55 FR 4209) an Advance Notice of a Proposed Rule (ANPR) to announce that
consideration was being given to the possible reclassification or delisting of the bald eagle in all or part of its
range in the lower 48 States.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations Resulting From Advance Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The responses received to the ANPR generally reflected the Service's announcement that delisting, as well as reclassification,
was under consideration for the entire lower 48-State area. Not all responses specifically addressed delisting
or reclassification. Nevertheless, the responses were useful in the formulation of the present reclassification
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many responses reflected the writers' strong personal feelings and concerns for bald eagles. Many respondents related
the importance and value of their personal bald eagle experiences. Further, they expressed their desire that bald
eagles be properly cared for and that the opportunity to view wild eagles not be lost. The bald eagle's position as our
national bird was frequently mentioned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the ANPR, the Service received 4 responses from other Federal government offices, 22 responses from
State conservation agencies, 23 responses from citizen groups, and 140 responses from individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on reclassification goals contained in the five regional Bald Eagle Recovery Plans, one Federal agency favored
reclassification to threatened only in Florida and the development of State-by-State recovery plans/criteria,
with subsequent State-by-State reclassification and delisting decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another Federal agency recommended reclassification to threatened in selected areas based on circumstances in
the individual recovery regions, rather than for the nation as a whole, and recommended against delisting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third Federal agency recommended reclassification of the bald eagle to threatened in Arizona based on achievement
of the Southwestern Recovery Plan reclassification goals and on protection and management measures presently in
place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last Federal agency favored reclassification to threatened in those recovery regions where the recovery plans'
reclassification goals have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service received responses to the 1990 ANPR from 22 State natural resource agencies. Seven State agencies concurred
with reclassification to or retention as threatened, including Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, the three Northern
Region States where the bald eagle is presently designated as threatened. The remaining 15 responding States recommended
against delisting and/or reclassification in their States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the 140 individual responses (some signed by more than one individual), 135 opposed reclassification or delisting
in some or all areas of the lower 48 States; of the 23 citizen group responses, 19 opposed reclassification or delisting
in some or all areas of the lower 48 States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals and citizen groups suggested that it would be inappropriate to delist or reclassify the bald eagle to
threatened while direct and indirect impacts such as contaminants and development on non-Federal lands remain a
threat. The Service recognizes that habitat loss is a major challenge to the recovery of the bald eagle. The Service
also recognizes that non-Federal, as well as Federal, habitat must be protected from contaminants, disturbance,
and development or the secure population size will be diminished. However, reclassification to threatened would
not reduce present Federal legal protection on non-Federal land nor would it allow habitat loss that could not otherwise
occur.

A concern expressed by 62 individuals and 11 citizen groups was that bald eagle populations were below the higher levels
of America's pre-settlement days or other former era, or that populations did not meet the abundance, distribution,
or productivity goals for delisting or reclassification contained in the bald eagle recovery plans. The Act's designations
of endangered and threatened are based on the present or foreseeable threat of extinction of the species, not historical
levels. Recovery plan goals for reclassification have been met at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual suggested that the Service conduct a population viability analysis (PVA) of the bald eagle, including
a determination of the minimum viable population (MVP). The Service recognizes PVA and MVP as analytical tools and
has funded and participated in the production of PVA's for several endangered species. For the present reclassification
decision, however, it is unnecessary because the bald eagles of the Chesapeake, Northern, Southeastern, and Pacific
Recovery Regions have reached the recovery plans' reclassification goals. Those goals are conservative and meet
the Act's definition of threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appearance of a lowered level of Federal legal protection was a concern in 26 individual responses and in one citizen
group response. The prohibitions of section 9 of the Act are the same for threatened and endangered species, with the
exception that with reclassification to threatened, the Service could issue permits for limited exhibition and
educational purposes, for selected research work not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for
other special purposes consistent with the Act (50 CFR 17.32, 17.41). All requirements of the Act under section 7 still
apply. No changes in other protective provisions of the Act would result, nor would any other Federal law protecting
bald eagles be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirteen of the 135 individuals and 2 of the 19 citizen groups recommending against reclassification or delisting
were concerned that the Service's own efforts for bald eagle recovery, habitat management, habitat protection,
and law enforcement might be diminished. The Service's obligations to protect bald eagles under the Endangered Species
Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald Eagle Protection Act, and all other applicable laws will remain undiminished
by the proposed reclassification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven individuals and one citizen group recommending against reclassification or delisting suggested that the
Service might be either collaborating with or yielding to economic interests who want development restrictions
relaxed in areas presently used by bald eagles. The proposed reclassification eases no restrictions on the development
of bald eagle habitat because the Act and regulations adopted under it make no distinction in the protection given
to habitats of threatened and endangered species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven individual and two citizen group respondents suggested that the Service might be delisting or reclassifying
the bald eagle to enhance its reputation or for other self-serving purposes. This proposal to reclassify the bald
eagle from endangered to threatened is undertaken in fulfillment of section 4(c) of the Act, which requires the Service
to periodically review each listed species and to change classifications when appropriate, to maintain the integrity
of the Act's endangered and threatened categories. Since the bald eagle has met its recovery plan goals, the Service
is now taking this action.

One individual and two citizen groups, in addition to the Maine and New Hampshire State conservation agencies, suggested
that the northeastern part of the Northern States Recovery Region be separated and considered distinct. The Northern

recommend separating the northeastern States from the present Northern States Recovery Region. The Service concurs

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for reclassifying species on the Federal lists. A species may be listed or reclassified as threatened or endangered
due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These five factors and their application to the
bald eagle are as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bald eagle is associated with aquatic ecosystems throughout most of its range. Nesting almost never occurs farther
than 3 km (2 miles) from water (Gerrard and Bortolotti 1988). Fish predominate in the typical diet of eagles. Many other
types of prey are also taken, including waterfowl and small mammals depending on location, time of year, and population
cycles of prey species. Dead animals or carrion, especially in the wintering areas, are also taken when readily available
(Lincer et al. 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nest sites are usually in large trees along shorelines in relatively remote areas. The trees must be sturdy and open
to support a nest that is often 2&hyph;3 m (6&hyph;9 ft) across and more than a meter (3 ft) thick (Bent 1938). Bald eagles
also select cliffs or rock outcrops for nest sites where large trees are not available. This dependence upon very large
trees associated with water makes the eagle vulnerable to water-associated development pressures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the two major threats to the bald eagle at present and for the foreseeable future is destruction and degradation
of its habitat (the other major threat is environmental contaminants_see Factor E below). This occurs through direct
cutting of trees for shoreline development, human disturbance associated with recreational use of shorelines and
waterways, and contamination of waterways from point and non-point sources of pollution. Contamination enters
bald eagles through the food chain and may impair individual birds' reproductive success and health. It may also reduce
the abundance of preferred prey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steps to reduce these threats are underway at all levels of government and public organizations nationwide. Increased
protection of nesting habitat and winter roost sites have occurred in many areas throughout the country. Guidelines
to minimize human disturbance around nesting and winter roost sites have been developed in all parts of the country.
Areas of contamination continue to be identified and reduced. Rehabilitation, captive propagation reintroduction,
and transplanting programs have all worked toward increasing the viability of the U.S. bald eagle population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current threats to the bald eagle's habitat and range in the United States by Recovery Region are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chesapeake Bay Region: Buehler et al. (1991) reported that the bald eagle feeding and resting use of Chesapeake Bay
shoreline was directly related to the distance of development from the shoreline. Eagles tended to avoid shorelines
with nearby pedestrian or boat traffic. With human activity and development increasing, preferred bald eagle habitat
is diminishing. Associated land clearing reduces bald eagle nesting and perching sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To offset these impacts, the Service has expanded its National Wildlife Refuge System around the Chesapeake Bay area
to protect bald eagle habitat. For example, the Service acquired 3,500 acres of nesting and roosting habitat in the
James River area of Chesapeake Bay in 1991 to be protected and managed for bald eagles. Acquisition of an additional
600 acres is planned. The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which provides important eagle habitat on Chesapeake
Bay, is also proposing to acquire more land. Nickerson (1989) estimates that enough suitable unoccupied nesting
habitat remains that, if unaltered, it could sustain continued growth of the bald eagle population through the remainder
of the 20th century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northern States Recovery Region: Development, particularly near urban areas, remain as a primary threat. In spite
of these localized problems, bald eagle nesting activity in the Northern States Recovery Region has more than doubled
in the past 10 years from fewer than 700 to over 1600 territories known to be occupied. There also is ample unoccupied
habitat still available throughout this region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Great Plains States, loss of wintering habitat is a major concern. Wintering areas have been lost through development
of riparian areas for recreational, agricultural, and urban uses. Loss of wintering habitat also occurs due to lack
of cottonwood regeneration. This results from changes in floodplain hydrology from construction of reservoirs
and dam operations. Grazing also inhibits regeneration. A threat to some wintering populations of eagles in the Great
Plains States is the destruction of prairie dog colonies and other important foraging areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, management measures, reforestation, improved water quality, and a reduction in pesticide contamination
(see factor E below) have enabled the Northern States populations to increase substantially overall. Much eagle
nesting and wintering habitat is on publicly owned lands. Many of these lands are protected by habitat management
plans and strict eagle nest protection and management guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific Recovery Region: Development-related habitat loss continues to be the single greatest factor limiting
the abundance and distribution of the species in the Pacific Recovery Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1986).
Habitat conservation efforts, including laws and management practices by Federal and State agencies and efforts
by private organizations, have helped to facilitate bald eagle population increases in the Pacific Recovery Region
since the 1960's. For example, interagency working teams in six of the seven Pacific Recovery Region States have developed
implementation plans to address local issues more specifically than the recovery plan. Bald eagle habitat guidelines
have also been incorporated into development covenants and land use. California and Washington have rules relating
to bald eagles on private lands to encourage landowners to maintain nesting territory habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southeastern Recovery Region: The accelerated pace of development activities within eagle habitat and the extensive
area involved are the most significant limiting factors in the Southeastern Region. The cumulative effects of many
water development projects impinge on the ability to maintain current nesting populations and ultimately may limit
the extent to which recovery may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce these threats, habitat management guidelines are used to minimize development disturbance in and around
nests. Several counties and municipalities have adopted the guidelines in their land use and zoning policies. In
addition, a significant amount of new habitat has been created in the form of manmade reservoirs. Reservoirs primarily
provide wintering and non-nesting habitat, but are used by nesting eagles as well (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
1984, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, many of the States have or have had active hacking/reintroduction programs. Rehabilitation and release
of injured eagles occurs throughout the Southeastern Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1984, 1989). As a result
of these and other efforts, the bald eagle nesting population in the Southeastern Region has more than doubled in the
past 10 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southwestern Recovery Region: In addition to threats common with other Recovery Regions, such as human disturbance
and availability of adequate nesting and feeding habitat, the bald eagles of the Southwestern Recovery Region are
subjected to a high adult rate of mortality, isolation, heat stress, and nest parasites. The Arizona Bald Eagle Nestwatch
Program has significantly increased survival of young by minimizing human disturbance during important incubation
periods, and by removing harmful material such as parasites and fishing line debris from nests. However, the high
death rate of adults and nestlings and the lack of gene exchange with any adjacent nesting populations, which may cause
inbreeding to adversely affect the population's long-term survival, remain limiting; this population continues
to require intensive management, particularly around each nest site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hunt et al. (1992) estimate a minimum annual mortality rate of 16 to 22 percent of adult breeding birds and believe it
to be much higher. Bald eagles commonly live 20 years in the wild and up to 50 years in captivity (Stalmaster 1987). In
the Southwestern Region, adult life expectancy may not exceed 10&hyph;12 years (Hunt et al. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, the bald eagle in Arizona was more widely distributed but probably was never abundant (Hunt et al. 1992).
Prior to 1970, records can be found for 19 pairs of nesting bald eagles in Arizona (Hunt et al. 1992). In 1993, 27 occupied
territories were reported for Arizona and 2 for New Mexico totalling 29 for the Southwestern Recovery Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research to date indicates there has been no immigration to this population of bald eagles. According to Hunt et al.,
this small population is isolated and thus is subject to the genetic, demographic, and environmental threats known
to be associated with small populations. For these reasons, the population is in continued need of strict protection
and intensive management.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no legal commercial or recreational use of bald eagles. The Service considers present legal and enforcement
measures sufficient to prevent bald eagle extinction or a need to reclassify as endangered. The Service exercises
very strict control over scientific, educational, and Native American religious activities involving bald eagles
or their parts. With reclassification to threatened, the Service could issue permits for limited exhibition and
educational purposes, for selected research work not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for
other special purposes consistent with the Act (50 CFR 17.32 and 17.41(a)).

C. Disease or Predation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Predation is not a significant problem for bald eagle populations. Incidents of mortality due to territory disputes
between bald eagles have been reported. Diseases such as avian cholera, avian pox, aspergillosis, tuberculosis,
and botulism may affect individual eagles, but are not considered to be a significant threat to the population. In
the Southwestern population, the Mexican chicken bug, when abundant, is known to occasionally kill young. According
to the National Wildlife Health Research Center, National Biological Survey, Wisconsin, only 2.7 percent of bald
eagles submitted to the Center between 1985 and 1990 died from infectious disease.

The bald eagle is protected by the following Federal wildlife laws in the U.S.: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;Sections 7 and 9 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531

) protect individual bald eagles (threatened or endangered) and their active nests on public and private land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;The Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668) prohibits without specific authorization the possession,
transport, or take of any bald or golden eagle, their parts, nests or eggs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703) prohibits without specific authorization the possession,
transport, or take of any migratory bird (including bald eagles), their parts, nests or eggs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;The Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3372 and 18 U.S.C. 42&hyph;44) among other provisions, makes it unlawful to export,
import, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase any bald eagle, (1) taken or possessed in violation of any
law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or in violation of any Indian tribal law or (2) to be taken, sold, or transported
in interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of any law or regulation of any state or in violation of any foreign
law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contaminants may affect the survival as well as the reproductive success and health of the bald eagle. The abundance,
and potentially more important, the quality of prey may be seriously affected by environmental contamination. Although
many of the compounds implicated in reduced reproductive rates and direct mortality are no longer used, contaminants
continue to be a major problem. Pesticides in recent times have not impacted the bald eagle on a population level; however,
individual poisonings still occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carcasses baited with poison may attract bald eagles as well as target animals such as coyotes. Poisonings may occur
secondarily when predatory animals are poisoned and subsequently eaten by eagles. Crop insecticides may be taken
up by prey animals and may also result in eagle mortality. Organophosphates and carbamates are sometimes used illegally
for animal poison. The National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed over 100 cases of pesticide poisonings
in bald eagles in the past 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The western plains and Rocky Mountain States are reported to have 300&hyph;600 bald eagle deaths each year in the past
decade on western rangelands due, in part, to illegal use of pesticides such as famphur, phorate, and carbofuran,
and highly restricted chemicals, such as strychnine, Compound 1080 and others (Tom Jackson, Fish and Wildlife Service,
Denver, pers. comm.). This mortality on western rangelands corresponds with the primary wintering areas for most
western bald eagles (other than Pacific coast birds). Some illegal uses of pesticides are targeted at bald and golden
eagles. Cases of suspected intentional mortality through baiting of carcasses with pesticides has occurred in all
western States and may occur in other States. Reducing this level of illegal mortality is important for the complete
recovery of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chronic long-term exposure to contaminants is a much more extensive problem than direct mortality. Lifetime exposure
to contaminants may limit the eagles' reproductive capabilities, alter their behavior and foraging abilities,
and increase their susceptibility to diseases. (Organochlorines, such as DDT, are no longer legally used in the United
States. Their presence in bald eagles is generally a consequence of their long persistence in the environment. Consequently,
residues of such compounds from historic uses can still contaminate prey animals and be passed to eagles). Exposure
to these compounds is also occurring at an early age. For example, approximately 90% of the eaglets sampled in Maine
in 1992 had detectable levels of DDE in their blood.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Chesapeake Bay Region, Delaware Bay and the James River below Richmond continue to be a source of organochlorine
and heavy metal contaminants that may impact eagle reproduction (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). However,
DDE concentrations in addled bald eagle eggs in Chesapeake Bay have declined significantly from 1969&hyph;84 (Wiemeyer
et al. 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In parts of the Northern States Region, contamination is depressing bald eagle productivity. This occurs notably
in the coastal areas of the Great Lakes, those rivers accessible by anadromous fishes of the Great Lakes, and in parts
of Maine. Research on bald eagle productivity in the vicinity of Great Lakes shorelines indicates significantly
lower productivity than for inland breeding birds. The reduced productivity is correlated with concentrations
of PCB's, DDE, dieldrin, and other organochlorine compounds in addled eggs (Best et al. in press). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bald eagles of the Pacific Recovery Region nesting near the Columbia River estuary and Hood Canal, which is adjacent
to Puget Sound, repeatedly have low reproductive success. DDE and PCB's have had a deleterious effect on the reproduction
of bald eagles in the Columbia River estuary (Anthony et al. 1993). Wiemeyer et al. (1993) found addled bald eagle eggs
collected from Oregon ranked second (behind Maine) in DDE concentrations among the fifteen States sampled. However,
concentrations of other contaminants in the Oregon eggs were low. In spite of localized reproductive impairment,
the Pacific Recovery Region population has increased by about 68 percent in the past 10 years. Contaminants are not
known to be a significant problem for eagles in the Southwestern Recovery Region or Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead poisoning has also contributed to bald eagle mortality. The National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed
lead poisoning in more than 225 bald eagles during the last 15 years. Lead can poison bald eagles when they ingest prey
items that contain lead shot or lead fragments or where the prey has assimilated lead into its own tissues. In winter,
eagles frequently feed on waterfowl that are dead or dying from lead poisoning or upon waterfowl crippled in the hunting
season. Lead poisoning of eagles was a primary reason the Service required the nationwide use of non-toxic shot for
waterfowl hunting. The requirement for use of non-toxic shot was phased in over a period of 5 years, and its use became
mandatory for all waterfowl hunting in 1991. Use of lead shot is still permitted in many parts of Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of particular concern for bald eagles in the Southeastern Region and in Maine are the toxic effects of mercury (Wiemeyer
et al. 1993, C. Facmire, pers. comm.). High levels of mercury affect eagles with a variety of neurological problems,
where flight and other motor skills can be significantly altered, and with reduced hatching rates of eggs. Mercury
has entered the waterways as air emissions from solid waste incineration sites and other point and non-point sources.
Impacts from mercury to bald eagles are currently under investigation in the Southeastern Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illegal shooting still poses threats to individual birds. Improved law enforcement and public awareness has reduced
shooting impacts from a cause of large scale mortality in the first half of this century to the deaths of occasional
individuals at present. From 1985 to 1990, the National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed over 150 bald
eagle deaths due to gunshot. Hunter education courses routinely include bald eagle identification material to educate
hunters about bald eagles and the protections that the species is afforded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electrocutions occur on power poles and lines that are not yet configured for the protection of raptors. Much research
has been done in this area, and generally new poles and lines are configured to reduce raptor electrocutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Human disturbance also remains a long-term threat. Significant declines in eagle use of the Skagit River, Washington,
were noted in response to recreational activity (Stalmaster 1989). Human disturbance can be harmful during egg incubation
and young brooding periods because disturbance can flush adults from nests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land management practices can reduce or eliminate these disturbance problems. Management of bald eagle nesting
sites has progressed in some areas to include zones of protection extending up to 2.5 miles (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1986). In the Bear Valley National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, for example, public access is restricted from
November 1 through March 30 to prevent human disturbance to wintering bald eagles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these various threats to the bald eagle in the area proposed for reclassification, none are of sufficient
magnitude, individually or collectively, to place the species at risk of extinction. Over most of the 48 States, the
population is doubling every 6 or 7 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the lower 48 States except the southwestern
population in Arizona, New Mexico, the southeast corner of California within 10 miles of the Colorado River or the
river's mainstem reservoirs, and those portions of Texas and the panhandle of Oklahoma that are west of the 100th meridian.
The latter population appears to be isolated, to suffer from lower survival rates, and to require intensive management
to ensure nesting success. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five States where it is currently listed as
threatened and be listed as endangered in Mexico under this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recognition of Distinct Population of the Southwestern Recovery Region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1978, the Service recognized distinct population segments of this species on the basis of State boundaries, with
bald eagles in five northern States listed as threatened, and those in the remainder of the lower 48 States listed as
endangered. The distinctness of these population segments is questionable, given the dispersal capabilities of
the species across State lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposal, the recognition of the southwest bald eagle population as distinct from eagles elsewhere in the
lower 48 States is based on evidence that it appears to be reproductively isolated. Thus, for purposes of this proposed
rule, the Service still recognizes two populations of bald eagles in the lower 48 States. Should this proposed rule
become final, the southwest population segment would remain endangered, the adjacent Mexico population segment
would be included in the Southwestern population as endangered, and the remaining population segment in the lower
48 States would be reclassified to threatened.

Special Rule

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act allows special rules to be adopted for threatened species as needed for the species' conservation; such special
rules are typically provided to reduce those protections afforded to endangered species under the Act. Section 17.41(a)
is a special rule adopted at the time of the 1978 reclassification of the bald eagle. The original intent was to reduce
the number of permits required for researchers working on threatened eagles (i.e., Oregon, Washington, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan) under both &sect;17.32 and 50 CFR parts 21 and 22 (bird banding and eagle permits). The present
special rule at &sect;17.41(a) reads as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Bald eagles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Haliaeetus leucocephalus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) found in Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicable provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of &sect;&sect;17.31 and 17.32 shall apply to bald eagles specified in paragraph (a) of this section
to the extent such provisions are consistent with the Bald Eagle Act (16 U.S.C. 668&hyph;668d), the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;711), and the regulations issued thereunder.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service proposes to clarify the language of this special rule for threatened bald eagles. If the proposed special
rule is adopted, only a permit issued under the authority of 50 CFR 21.22 or 50 CFR part 22 (subpart C) would be needed
for such purposes as banding (&sect;21.22); scientific study or exhibition (&sect;22.21), which includes taking,
possession, rehabilitation, and transport; native American religious (&sect;22.22); and depredation (&sect;22.23).
A permit under &sect;17.32 would only be required when a permit under parts 21 and 22 do not provide for an otherwise
lawful activity. The issuance of all such permits would remain subject to section 7 of the Act and part 402 of this title.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effects of This Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the proposed reclassification, prohibitions outlined under 50 CFR 17.41(a) would apply to bald eagles
of the population reclassified as threatened. Prohibitions under &sect;&sect;17.21 and 17.22 would continue to
apply to the endangered population. The Service could issue permits for exhibition and educational purposes, for
selected research work (including banding and marking) not directly related to the conservation of the species,
and for other special purposes. In allowing for a single permit, the Service seeks to foster further research and other
uses of bald eagles consistent with the Act and the purposes of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald Eagle Act (50
CFR 17.32, 17.41(a), 21.22, 22.21&hyph;22.23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements of the Act under section 7 still apply to all Federal agencies. There are no distinctions made in the Act
or supporting regulations (part 402) between endangered and threatened species. The consultation and other requirements
under section 7 apply equally to species with either classification.

Public Comments Solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends that the proposed reclassification correctly reflect the bald eagle's status according to the
Act's definition of endangered and threatened and based upon the reclassification guidelines for each bald eagle
recovery region. Therefore, information from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific
community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments
are sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the location of any additional nests or roosting sites of this species, especially in the Southwestern Recovery
Region; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the appropriateness of the proposed limits and status of the endangered population in the American Southwest
and Mexico; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) additional information concerning the past and present range, distribution, and population size of this species;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) current or planned activities within the lower 48 States and Mexico that might have possible long-term impacts
on this species. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Final promulgation of the regulation(s) on this species will take into consideration the comments and any additional
information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this
proposal, including the possible complete reclassification to threatened for all eagles south of Canada.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this
determination was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requests comments on proposed amendments of right-of-way regulations containing
procedures for setting fair market rent for communication uses located on public lands. The proposed rule would establish
rental schedules and procedures for 11 categories of communication service for which fair market value is required
for the use of public lands. The proposed schedule has been developed in cooperation with the Forest Service (FS).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed schedule is an attempt to improve the processing of right-of-way authorizations for communications
use of public lands and reduce agency appraisal costs associated with setting and updating rental payments on approximately
1,500 authorized communications uses for which rent is currently required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rental schedule is applicable to commercial and private communication uses authorized by a BLM right-of-way
authorization. The uses include television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, rebroadcast devices, cable television,
commercial mobile radio service, private mobile communication, cellular telephone, common carrier microwave,
private microwave, facility manager, and miscellaneous uses. The proposed rule also would require payment of a percentage
of the sublease rent collected by the holder from its tenants. Rental payments are waived for applicants or holders
who provide public telecommunication services and are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
as a noncommercial, educational radio or television station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following objectives have been adopted to guide development of the rental schedule and implementation of procedures
to balance carefully the public's interest in obtaining fair market rent: (1) Allow the continued growth of communication
markets and services, especially in rural areas; (2) design a process that is cost effective, sets rental payments
that are predictable and can be easily updated; (3) provide incentive for improved management of communication sites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule takes into consideration recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory
Committee, information provided by users, industry groups, private appraisers, and comments received by the FS
in response to their proposed policy published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 13, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comparative information provided by BLM and private appraisers was screened carefully only to include examples
of land rent. The rent paid does not include any payment for services such as power, access, building and/or tower space,
or maintenance. Information used was provided by the principals in those transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed procedures will provide a consistent approach for the administration and assessment of rental payments
for communication uses on public lands. The schedule provides incentives for co-locating single users within existing
facilities under a multiple use right-of-way authorization. The rule also outlines a process for setting and updating
rental payments and phasing in substantial increases in rental payments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BLM's process for setting fair market rent for communication uses has been directly influenced by FS efforts to
set a rental payment schedule. In a 1983 administrative appeal decision, the FS determined that the formula used to
determine fair market rental for communication site use was not in compliance with the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The formula used at that time was two-tenths (0.2) of 1 percent of the permittee's investment plus 5 percent of the
rental fees received by the FS permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula has remained unchanged for about 40 years, as have FS rental payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1985, the FS adopted a new policy for setting rental payments. Under that policy, communication use rental fees
were to be based on (1) a fee schedule, (2) individual site appraisals, or (3) competitive bidding. In 1989, the FS implemented
regional schedules under that policy. Proposed rentals generated opposition from industry groups_primarily television
and radio broadcasters_and complaints to Congress. At the same time, efforts by certain BLM State Offices to increase
rental payments caused similar complaints to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To forestall significant increases in rental payments, Congress enacted a moratorium prohibiting any increases
in rental fees above those in effect on January 1, 1989. This affected both agencies. The FS was also asked to review
the schedules, with particular emphasis on their impact on rural communities in the Western United States, and to
report their findings to the congressional Appropriations Committees. The report was submitted to Congress in 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM and FS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in April 1991. The MOU provides for cooperation to develop
and implement similar methods for determining rental fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1991, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act limited increases in communication
site fees in Fiscal Year 1992 to 15 percent over the levels in effect on January 1, 1989. The conference report also directed
both the FS and BLM jointly to establish a broad-based advisory group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to that direction, an advisory group, the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee, was
established, which included BLM, FS, and representatives from the broadcast industry (users of both public and private
communication sites). The advisory committee prepared and submitted a report to the Secretaries of the Interior
and Agriculture in December 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advisory committee report made several recommendations. These included use of rental schedules instead of individual
appraisals for setting rental payments, acceptance of industry-recognized market ranking systems, a phase-in
period for rent increases greater than $1,000, a provision for charging 25 percent of the gross sublease income, and
annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index (Urban Consumer, U.S. City Average). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advisory committee also recommended a specific rental schedule. The schedule included a discount of 30 percent
from estimated rental value to account for perceived difficulties in obtaining use authorizations on Federal lands.
The advisory committee report indicated that the rental schedule did not reflect fair market value, and it was required
to be amended by BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1993, the FS published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of proposed policy (``Fee Schedule for Communication Uses'') and invited comments. The FS proposed to adopt
a revised rental schedule for television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, commercial mobile radio, and cellular telephone
uses on National Forest System lands. The proposed schedule would supplement individual FS regional schedules adopted
in 1989 and modified in 1992. The regional schedules of the FS recognize 13 types of communication uses. They include
(1) radio broadcast, (2) television broadcast, (3) broadcast translator, (4) cable and subscription television,
(5) mobile radio-commercial communications, (6) cellular telephone, (7) common carrier microwave relay, (8) industrial
microwave relay, (9) mobile radio-internal communications, (10) natural resource/environmental monitoring,
(11) passive reflector, (12) amateur radio, and (13) personal/private receive only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Act) was signed into law. The Act directed the BLM and FS to assess
and collect in 1994 an annual rental payment 10 percent above the rent paid in 1993. For most right-of-way holders required
to pay rent, this was the first increase since 1989.

Summary of Comments Received by the Forest Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FS received 84 letters providing suggestions and comments regarding the proposed schedule. In general, the comments
reflected confusion over the definition of uses covered, how geographic areas would be determined, and rents calculated.
Comments also suggested that the proposed rents were excessive, that the information relied upon was not representative,
and that provisions regarding indexing and revenue sharing (25 percent of the gross sublease income) were not commonplace
in the private rental market. Many comments expressed concern that adoption of the schedule would have an adverse
impact on small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments provided several suggestions. Several suggested that additional price levels be added to improve fairness
and reduce impact on permit holders in rural areas. Several comments suggested that commercial mobile radio users
should not be subject to paying 25 percent of the gross sublease income when their primary business, or only use of the
facility, is to rent space to other customers. With respect to television and FM radio, most of the comments suggested
that the advisory committee report be the basis for setting rental payments. Several comments provided information
on rents currently being paid and suggested what are considered to be reasonable rental payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM proposed schedule has been developed considering comments received by the FS, and the comments have been adopted
or incorporated as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(9) states that it is the policy of the United States to receive the fair market value of the use of the
public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
43 U.S.C. 1761(a) gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way for communication
uses, including systems for transmission or reception of radio, television, telephone, telegraph, and other electronic
signals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
43 U.S.C. 1764(g) requires the payment of a rental. The holder is required to pay in advance the fair market value as
determined by the Secretary granting, issuing, or renewing such right-of-way. The Secretary may waive part or all
of the payment when it is found to be equitable and in the public interest. Rights-of-way issued at less than fair market
value are not assignable except with the approval of the Secretary issuing the right-of-way. The regulations implementing
right-of-way provisions of FLPMA are found in 43 CFR part 2800. Provisions regarding rental payments are found in
43 CFR subpart 2803, and state in part that the holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit is required to
pay annually, in advance, with certain exceptions, the fair market value rental. This is determined by the authorized
officer, applying sound business management principles and, so far as practicable and feasible, using comparable
commercial practices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Factors Considered in Developing the Proposed Rental Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed schedule takes into consideration a variety of factors. These factors include (1) recommendations
of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee, (2) market information provided by users, industry
groups, private and Government appraisers, and (3) practical considerations associated with developing a cost-effective
method for setting and collecting fair market value for communication site use of public lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM has incorporated many of the recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee
regarding use of a schedule instead of individual appraisals to set rental payments, a phase-in period, use of an index
to update annual rental payments, and a provision for charging 25 percent of the gross sublease rent. However, the
BLM amended the recommended rental schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The television schedule recommended by the advisory committee was based on a market ranking system that is no longer
published, and the rental payments did not represent fair market value. The advisory committee schedules were based
on setting the highest rent for the largest market and for each smaller market dividing the rent in half. The rent suggested
by the advisory committee was further reduced by 30 percent to reflect what a majority of members of the advisory committee
believed to be the difference between a private lease and BLM or FS authorization. The advisory committee schedule
would have resulted in a reduction in current revenues from radio and television use on public lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rental schedule for television and radio is higher for certain markets, and lower for others, than the
schedule recommended by the advisory committee. This reflects comparable market information, elimination of the
suggested 30 percent discount, and an effort to develop a reasonable schedule that covers markets ranging from small
rural ones in Montana and Wyoming to larger ones serving Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Reno. To increase fairness, the proposed
schedule includes 9 rent levels instead of 6 as recommended by the advisory committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Market information was obtained from industry groups, individual users, appraisers, and other persons responding
to the FS notice. Market information compiled by BLM and FS appraisers was carefully screened to exclude from the rents
reported any payment for services such as power, access, building and/or tower space, or maintenance. This information
has been compiled by each BLM State Office for purposes of preparing individual appraisals. Since very few appraisals
have been prepared over the last 5 years, some of the information is outdated. Therefore, BLM considered more than
market information. The public is requested to provide information as to communication site rentals on private land
established within the last 3 years. This information would be considered in adjusting the rental schedules proposed
in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A representative sampling of reliable market information to develop a national schedule for a variety of communication
uses is difficult to obtain. The information is not readily available, the number of recent transactions is relatively
small, and often the information is incomplete or conflicting. Generally, information provided by appraisers is
the most complete and has supplemented information provided by various industry groups. This variety of information
has been used to establish relative values for various communication uses, depending on population or location criteria.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comparable private leases reflect several factors relevant to market value. One, strategically located mountaintops
are valuable for communication purposes. Mountaintop sites allow users to send signals from point to point or deliver
a signal that covers a geographical area. Mountaintop communication sites often provide better coverage, and are
less expensive to develop, than other alternatives for reaching the same size population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two, rental payments for broadcast uses are related to the population served by the television or radio transmitter.
Strategically located mountaintops serving larger populated areas are generally more valuable than those serving
smaller markets. Locations within the same market that provide the best coverage will also rent for more than secondary
locations. It should be noted that not all mountaintops have value for broadcast use. The proposed schedule attempts
to reflect the rent for typical locations on BLM administered lands, rather than rentals set for specific authorizations
and established by appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three, there is competition for strategically located mountain sites. Private or public mountain locations close
to populated areas that have access and power are preferred by broadcast users. There are few places where there is
direct competition between private and public sites. The sites used are those that provide the best coverage. However,
in many areas rents charged on private lands are higher than rents charged for similarly located sites on public land.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four, mountaintops generally are intensively developed and often command premium rental payments when compared
to single use sites. The multiple user sites provide a mixture of high and low power communication uses, including
radio, television, and mobile radio and cellular. These sites often include large buildings, a variety of towers,
and well maintained public or private roads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five, various nonbroadcast uses are not dependent upon the population served. These uses include microwave, cellular,
and mobile radio facilities in rural areas. Rental payments for these uses are related to general real estate values
in the immediate area of the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six, there is little difference in the rental payment for single use sites in small rural markets. Often rent paid in
the private rural market does not vary significantly among the various communication uses. This is due to local economic
conditions and forces within the market to provide a basic level of communication service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the schedule, consideration was given to current assessed rent. Since current BLM rentals are based
on individual appraisals, rental payments established in the last 5 years were considered to reflect fair market
value. This information was used as a benchmark for assessing reasonableness and providing a measure of consistency
in areas where there was little direct market information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry groups have objected to use of market information for setting rental payments on public lands. They argue
that the rights authorized under terms of a BLM or FS grant are different than those provided under a private lease,
and that private landowners provide more service and do not require compliance with stringent environmental requirements.
They also argue that television and radio broadcasters provide a public service and, therefore, that rental payments
should be partially or totally waived. The few cases in which there has been competitive bidding for communication
uses on Federal or State lands do not support these contentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Practical considerations also contributed to development of a rental schedule. The FS has been engaged in a 10-year
effort, which BLM joined in 1990, to determine fair market rent for communication site uses. In addition, both the
BLM and the FS have supported the use of a regulatory schedule to reduce the costs and delays associated with obtaining
individual appraisals. It is estimated that the annual costs of updating and appraising BLM right-of-way grants
for communication use would be $3&hyph;4 million. This is approximately double the current annual revenues from
communication site rights-of-way. Use of a schedule would be more cost effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rents charged in the private market are not based upon schedules. Instead, rents are based upon negotiations between
the landowner and the prospective user. The rent is set on a individual basis, depending on the use and the terms and
conditions of the lease agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent practicable, the schedules proposed attempt to approximate a reasonable rent for the authorized use.
They do not attempt to replicate site-specific appraisal values. Instead, the schedule merely establishes a reasonable
amount of rent to be assessed for the type of authorized use based on location or population criteria. Therefore, the
BLM believes the proposed rental schedule reflects fair market value.

The BLM currently administers approximately 3,200 communication use authorizations. In accordance with agency
regulations, approximately 50 percent of the authorizations pay no rent. Right-of-way holders not required to pay
annual rent include Federal, State, and local government agencies. The remaining communication use right-of-way
holders pay an annual rental based upon agency-approved appraisals. Generally, communication use authorizations
are reappraised every 5 years and new rental payments are established. However, for a variety of reasons, most of the
communication use rental fees are currently out of date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2803.1&hyph;2(c)(3)(i) of 43 CFR states that the rental shall be based on either a market survey of comparable
rentals, or on a value determination for specific parcels or groups of parcels. Most communication use rental fees
are based upon individual appraisals prepared by agency staff appraisers. Some BLM State Offices have instituted
market surveys or administrative schedules for setting rental payments. Current regulations also allow use of competitive
bidding for purposes of determining rental for the use of public lands. Bids less than fair market rental value of the
lands are not considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would establish a rental payment schedule for various communication uses for which fair market
rental is required. However, with the concurrence of the BLM State Director, the authorized officer may reduce or
waive the rental when it is determined that the rental will cause undue hardship on the holder/applicant and that it
is in the public interest to waive the rental payment. Current right-of-way rental waiver policy is not affected by
this proposed schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed schedule reflects rental values for BLM-authorized communication uses. The BLM right-of-way authorization
is similar to a private lease for communication purposes. The authorization is for 30 years or the life of the project,
and contains provisions regarding renewal, termination, assignment, and liability. Other provisions may include
subleasing and bonding. New applicants for use of public lands are subject to application and processing fees associated
with complying with environmental requirements. New and existing users may be subject to reimbursement of reasonable
costs associated with agency monitoring of use. Therefore, the proposed schedule reflects a reasonable estimate
of the fair market rental value for communication uses on public lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impacts on industry and users paying rental vary. Television and radio broadcasters in large markets, or users whose
rent has not been adjusted for 5, 10, or more years, may experience a significant increase. However, there are several
situations where rental payments will decline. The best estimate is that total revenues from BLM-authorized communication
uses will be approximately the same. However, costs associated with individual billing and preparing and updating
appraisals will be significantly reduced. Although rental increases may be significant in some cases, they will
be phased in over a 5-year period. In addition, the current regulations include a provision (43 CFR 2803.1&hyph;2(b)(2)(iv))
allowing partial waiver or deferral of rental by the authorized officer based on a claim of hardship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the provision for rounding of right-of-way rental payments would be removed in the proposed rule. This would
simplify the calculation of rental payments by BLM and their payment by right-of-way holders. The rounding provision
has unnecessarily complicated the calculation of rental fees, and increased billing errors, with little or no benefit
to the customer. The rounding provision and its removal are revenue neutral. Revenues would be neither enhanced nor
diminished.

The proposed schedule is applicable to the communication uses described below. The proposed rental schedule is not
applicable to holders of facilities authorized under terms of a right-of-way grant to public telecommunications
service operators providing public television or radio broadcast service. However, such holders would be responsible
for paying a percentage of the gross sublease rent received from tenants in the facility that do not qualify as nonprofit
entities. The term ``primary use'' is the predominant use of the facility by the holder authorized under terms of the
right-of-way authorization. The term ``facility'' is defined as the building, tower, and other related incidental
improvements authorized under terms of the right-of-way authorization.

General Application of Proposed Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rental schedule applies to right-of-way holders who are authorized to operate and maintain communication
facilities on public lands. The proposed base rent charged is for the primary use of the building. The primary use is
defined as the predominant use of the facility by the holder and authorized under terms of the right-of-way authorization.
The use may be classified as television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, rebroadcast devices, cable television, cellular
telephone, commercial mobile radio, private mobile radio, private microwave, common carrier microwave, facility
manager, or be included under the miscellaneous category. Tenants occupying space in the facility under terms of
the authorization will not be required to have a separate BLM authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rental schedules will be applicable to new and existing communication use authorizations requiring
annual payment of fair market rental as of the date of publication of the final rule. However, the authorized officer
may use other methods including individual appraisals or competitive bidding for new sites, or existing sites where
it is shown that the rental schedule does not represent fair market value. Rental payments covering portions of calendar
years will be prorated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three major categories of use: broadcast, nonbroadcast, and other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Broadcast includes television, FM radio, rebroadcast devices, and cable television. The proposed rent for broadcast
categories will be based on the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The right-of-way holder will provide a 1-millivolt contour map or statement to BLM identifying the principal community
(city, cities, metro area, or county) served by the transmitter. Communities served do not include areas served by
translators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Rent for television, FM radio, and rebroadcast devices (translators and low power television) will be based on
the population of the principal community or communities the transmitter primarily serves. The population of the
principal community will be based on the most recent United States census information.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Rent for cable television will be based on total basic subscribers as reported by the holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Rent for rebroadcast devices will be based on the U.S. census population of the principal community identified
in the FCC license that is served by the transmitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following examples are provided to illustrate how the base rent for a broadcast use would be calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A television facility in Clark County, Nevada, principally serving the communities of Las Vegas (pop. 258,259),
North Las Vegas (pop. 47,707), Henderson (pop. 64,942), and Boulder City (pop. 12,567) would pay a proposed annual
rental of $16,000 per year. This is based on total population of the principal communities of 370,908. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An FM radio facility in Imperial County, California, principally serves El Centro (pop. 31,384), Yuma, Arizona (pop.
106,895), and San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico (pop. 76,684). The annual rent would be calculated based on the total population
of the communities. The proposed annual rent would be $4,000 per year, based on the population of its principal communities
of 214,983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rent for nonbroadcast uses_commercial mobile radio service, private mobile communication, cellular telephone,
common carrier microwave, private microwave, facility manager and miscellaneous uses_will be assessed on a different
basis. Rent will be based on county population where the transmitter is located or the population of an adjacent or
nearby county served by the transmitter, whichever is greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following examples are provided to illustrate how the base rent for nonbroadcast uses would be calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rent for a right-of-way holder owning a facility in Pershing County, Nevada, (pop. 4,436) primarily
used for common carrier microwave would be assessed $1,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commercial mobile radio service facility in Madison County, Idaho (23,674), serving the Idaho Falls community
in Bonneville County, Idaho (72,207), would be assessed a proposed rent of $1,500. Since the transmitter serves a
trade area that is predominately in the adjacent county, the Bonneville County population would be used to determine
the rental payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holder owning a commercial mobile radio service facility used primarily to provide mobile radio service in the San
Diego County (pop. 2,498,016) market would pay a proposed rent of $12,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third major category is miscellaneous communication uses. These uses include amateur radio, personal/private
receive-only, passive reflectors, and natural resource and environmental monitoring equipment. These uses may
be permanent or temporary and the rent is either a flat rent of $75 for a full year or a prorated rent if the term is less
than a year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fair market rent depends on the type of communication use and the demand for it in a local market. Therefore, the
market value may change if there is a significant change from a single use to a multiple use facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Authorized holders may allow other users in their building under terms of their right-of-way authorization. Additional
users will not be required to have a separate right-of-way authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that all categories of use be subject to a provision regarding the payment of a percentage of gross rent
received from the sublease rent of space in the facility. The facility owner will be responsible for paying the base
rent for the authorized primary use of the facility, plus a percent of gross sublease rent for tenants within the facility.
Gross sublease rent is defined as the rent received by the holder of the communication use right-of-way grant from
tenants for space in the building or on the tower. Gross sublease rent does not include road or building maintenance
or service fees for power and backup generators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM proposes to assess all users holding a right-of-way authorization a base rent plus 15 percent, for the first
5 years, of the annual gross receipts received from renting space in the facility. In the sixth year after the effective
date of this rule, the percentage would be increased to 25 percent. This provision would apply to any use co-located
in the facility for which the owner is receiving a sublease rental payment. The following procedures will be used to
calculate the rent: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. BLM will initiate a billing for the annual base rent calculated from the proposed schedule; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. When making the assessed annual base rent payment, the holder will submit a certified statement to the BLM regarding
rent collected from tenants during the previous year, and include the required precentage of gross rental with the
total payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rental payment required for the category of facility manager is also based on a base rent plus 15 percent
of gross receipts from rental of space in the facility. In the sixth year after the effective date of this rule, the percentage
would be increased to 25 percent. The percentage applies to all population strata for that category.

Annual Fee Updating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current procedures rental payments are updated every 5 years. During the 1980's, the increases were often fairly
substantial and resulted in complaints and increased appeals. In many cases rental payments had not been updated
for 10 to 15 years. Limitations on the agency's authority to increase rent over the last 4 years have exacerbated the
problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The base rent proposed in the schedule will be updated annually based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U), U.S. City Average, published in July of each year. Calculating the amount
of the annual adjustment involves changing the previous year's rental by the change in the level of the CPI&hyph;U
for the current year. The following example illustrates the computation of percent change:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Market information regarding use of an index was mixed. However, more recent transactions indicate that increases
in annual rent are linked to changes in the Consumer Price Index instead of increases in land value. This reflects the
desire of property owners to maintain the relative value of the annual payments in terms of annual inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received by the FS expressed concern that the Consumer Price Index may dramatically increase rents beyond
the ability of right-of-way holders to pass on the increases to their customers. These correspondents also were concerned
that the increases over time would be higher than normal increases in land rents in the private market. The BLM agrees
with the comments and proposes to limit annual increases based on the CPI&hyph;U to no more than 5 percent.

Phase In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce potential impact of large increases in rent, BLM proposes to phase in substantial increases in the base rent
and percentage of gross rental receipts. Additional rent based upon a percentage of gross rent for space rental in
the facility will not be phased in. Initial increases in the base rental payments in excess of $1,000 or 20 percent of
the current rent, whichever is greater, will be phased in over a 5-year period. Subsequent increases in rent above
the first year will be based on an equal annual installment, plus the inflation adjusted increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, if the current base rent is $700 and the new rent based on the schedule is $2,700, the first year's rent
would be $1,700 plus the inflation-adjusted increase, and the rent for years 2 through 5 would be increased $250 per
year. Assuming a 2 percent increase in the CPI&hyph;U during the 5 year phase-in period, the base rents would be calculated
as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional rent based on a percentage of gross rent received from tenants covered by the right-of-way authorization
would also be phased in. The percentage would be set at 15 percent during the first 5 years after the effective date of
this rule, and 25 percent thereafter.

Exceptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rental payments only apply to those communication users that are required to pay a fair market rental.
Current regulations exempt Federal, State, or local government agencies or instrumentalities thereof, except
municipal utilities and cooperatives whose principal source of revenue is customer charges. Also exempt are rights-of-way
authorized under a statute that explicitly does not require payment of a rental, and facilities constructed under
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM proposes to close a loophole through which ``exempt'' agencies derive revenue from the rental of space within
their facility or the area authorized. Section 2803.1&hyph;2(b)(1)(i) would be amended to require ``exempt'' agencies
to pay fair market rent for those uses from which they derive revenue from the rental of space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is BLM's intent to use the rental fee schedule for all existing communication uses covered by the proposed rule.
However, when it is determined by the authorized officer that the rental payment schedule does not reasonably reflect
fair market rent, other reasonable means will be used to estimate the rental payment. The BLM reserves the right to
use individual appraisals or other valuation procedures to calculate rental payments for communication uses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The communication use rental schedule will be re-evaluated, and if necessary, revised periodically to ensure that
rentals are fair. Schedules based on county population will be re-evaluated after completion of the next census in
2000. The updated county population information will be substituted for 1990 county population figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Partial Waiver of Rent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
43 U.S.C. 1764(g) provides authority to charge less than fair market value if the holder provides at reduced or no charge
a valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary concerned. Actions taken by the holder at no cost
or reduced costs to the public may be considered in granting a temporary, partial, or full waiver. Any requirement
placed on the applicant or holder as a condition of granting or renewing the authorization is required to be legal and
not result in additional costs unrelated to the use authorized. Therefore, requirements that the building owner
set aside 10 percent of its space for Government use or that Federal agencies be granted free use in the building should
be considered in setting fair market rent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Basis for Rental Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the schedule, the BLM has considered information from a variety of sources. This includes information
provided by industry groups, existing BLM rents that are believed to reflect fair market value, data and information
provided by BLM appraisers, and information gathered by the FS in preparing their schedule. The BLM has also taken
into consideration the recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee. The rental
schedules are included in the proposed regulatory text.

Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BLM is requesting public comment on all aspects of this proposed rule as well as comments on specific questions.
Specific comments are requested regarding the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is the proposed schedule reasonable? If not, what information can you provide that would help in setting a fair and
reasonable schedule? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are the proposed phase-in methods for base rents and percentage of gross rental receipts reasonable? If not, please
suggest a method that can be easily implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Are the categories clearly defined? Would there be any potential problems in determining the category of use? Please
provide suggestions to improve the description of each category of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Are there any potential problems in setting the base rent for commercial mobile radio services based on the population
of the county in which the transmitter is located or the nearby or adjacent county predominantly served by the transmitter,
whichever is greater? Please suggest alternative methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conform with the format requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Note at the beginning of Group 2800
is being removed, and the information provided there is being included in new sections 2800.0&hyph;9, 2810.0&hyph;9,
and 2880.0&hyph;9. There is no substantive change involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal author of this final rule is David Cavanaugh of the Division of Lands, BLM, assisted by the staff of the
Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Bureau of Land Management has determined
that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual
(DM), Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions
listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental
policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions
which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found
to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment
nor an environmental impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule will bring annual rental fees charged holders of authorizations for communications sites on public lands,
which have been held to artificially low levels for many years, to fair market value as required by statute and administrative
direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees that would be placed in effect by this proposed rule would bring existing rental charges for communications
sites authorization holders on the public lands more into line with those who lease land from private landowners.
The increased revenues resulting from this fee schedule will result in increased payments to States and counties
in which the public lands containing the authorized facilities are located under current statutory authorities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed
rule, with its fee schedule, affects only that segment of the communications industry operating on the public lands.
There are 57 FM radio broadcast sites, 26 television broadcasting facilities, and approximately 3,200 other permits
in effect on these lands. Available records do not indicate how many of these permits are held by small entities. The
phase-in of annual fees proposed in this rule will allow any small entities that may be affected to adjust to the new
fees over a period of time and thereby minimize the risk of adverse impact due to the magnitude of some fee increases
under the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule will result in no taking of private property and no impairment of property rights, the Department
certifies that this rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally
protected property rights, as required by Executive Order 12630. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards
provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501

(e) The annual rental payment for communication uses listed below shall be based on rental payment schedules. The
rental schedules apply to right-of-way holders authorized to operate and maintain communication facilities on
public lands, and state the base rent charged for the primary use of the building. They do not apply to rights-of-way
granted to public telecommunications service operators providing public television or radio broadcast services.
The schedules do not include the percentage of the gross rent required by paragraph (e)(6) to be paid by the holder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The schedules are applicable to communication uses providing the following services: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Television broadcast includes facilities primarily used to broadcast UHF and VHF audio and video signals for
general public reception. This category does not include stations licensed by the FCC as a Low Power Television (LPTV)
or rebroadcast devices such as translators, or transmitting devices such as microwave relays serving broadcast
translators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) FM radio broadcast includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC-licensed facilities primarily used to broadcast
frequency modulation (FM) audio signals for general public reception. This category is not applicable to stations
licensed by the FCC as a low power FM radio. This category does not include rebroadcast devices such as translators,
boosters or AM synchronous transmitters or microwave relays serving broadcast translators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Rebroadcast devices include FCC-licensed facilities primarily used to rebroadcast a signal from its point
of origin. This category includes translators and low power television, low power FM radio, and microwave relays.
Microwave facilities used in conjunction with LPTV and broadcast translators are included in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Cable television includes FCC-licensed facilities that primarily transmit video programming to multiple
subscribers in a community over a wired network. This category does not include rebroadcast devices that retransmit
television signals of one or more television broadcast stations, personal or internal antenna systems such as private
systems serving hotels or residences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Commercial mobile radio service includes FCC-licensed commercial mobile radio facilities primarily providing
mobile communication service to individual customers. Such services generally include two-way voice and paging
services such as community repeaters, trunked radio (specialized mobile radio), two-way radio dispatch, and public
switched network (telephone/data) interconnect service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Cellular telephone includes FCC-licensed systems primarily used for mobile communications using a blend of
radio and telephone switching technology, and providing public switched network services to fixed and mobile users
within a tightly defined geographic area. This category includes Personal Communication Systems, a digital mobile
telephone service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Common carrier microwave includes FCC-licensed facilities primarily used for long-line intrastate and interstate
public telephone, television, information, and data transmissions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(viii) Private microwave includes FCC-licensed facilities primarily used by pipeline and power companies, railroads,
and land resource management companies. Communication services associated with this category may include private
mobile service, private two-way dispatch service, private paging, supervisory remote control/sensing, and microwave
voice/video/data services. This use is solely in support of the holder's primary business activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Facility manager includes holders who may or may not have FCC licenses, but do not operate telecommunications
equipment. The primary purpose of their facilities is to lease or sublease space for a variety of tenants who engage
in telecommunication activities. The building owner generally provides space in the building and/or tower, and
utilities, access, security, and backup generator services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Other communication uses include FCC-licensed private communication uses such as amateur radio, personal/private
receive-only antennas, passive reflectors, and natural resource and environmental monitoring equipment.

(2) The rental schedules will be updated annually based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U, U.S. City Average, published in July of each year). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Increases in base rental payments over 1994 levels in excess of $1,000, or 20 percent of the 1994 rent, whichever
is greater, will be phased in over a 5-year period. In 1995, the rental payment will be the 1994 rental, plus $1,000 or
20 percent of the 1994 rental, whichever is greater, plus the annual adjustment under paragraph (e)(2). The amount
exceeding the above $1,000 or 20 percent threshold will be divided into 4 equal installments, and beginning in 1996
the installment, plus the annual adjustment in the total rent, will be added to the previous year's rent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

reflect fair market rent for the individual authorized use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Annual rental payments shall be calculated and submitted based on the following schedules:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) has amended its finding of no significant
impact (FONSI) dated February 3, 1993, with respect to the potential environmental impact resulting from a proposal
by Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (AEPCO), to construct and operate a new ash and scrubber waste disposal
facility adjacent to its Apache Generating Station.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Apache Generating Station is located approximately 11 miles southeast of the Town of Willcox in Cochise County,
Arizona. The proposed project consists of constructing a 285-acre disposal facility that will include two ash pond
cells, an evaporation pond, and a scrubber sludge disposal pond. Due to site topography, the above ground height of
the disposal facility's exterior dikes will range from 5 feet along the western border to 30 feet along the eastern
border. The dike side slopes and pond bottoms will be lined with high density synthetic polyethylene flexible membrane
liners. Above ground pipelines will be used to sluice the ash and scrubber wastes from the plant to the disposal facility.
The facility is designed as a no discharge system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives considered to the proposed project included reconstruction of the existing ash and sludge ponds (no
action), total conversion of the Station to burn natural gas, sale of the ash and scrubber sludge, dry disposal of ash
and scrubber sludge, and construction of new disposal facilities at a different location. REA considered these alternatives
and concluded in a FONSI published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 12, 1993 that constructing new ash and scrubber waste disposal facilities at the AEPCO's proposed site
was the preferred alternative to ensure continued operation of the Apache Station's coal-fired units and compliance
with recent aquifer protection legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to REA's previous action, an earth fissure was identified within the boundaries of AEPCO's preferred
site. This issue was considered significant enough for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to
require an onsite investigation. REA decided to reevaluate the proposed project based on the results of that investigation.
The amended FONSI is based on a review of the following information: (1) Combustion Waste Disposal Facility Fissure
Investigation; (2) Public Hearing Transcript on the draft Aquifer Protection Permit (APP); (3) Responsiveness
Summary prepared by the ADEQ in response to public comments on the draft APP; (4) Final APP issued on April 22, 1994;
and (5) other permits and approvals issued for the proposed facility and referenced in the FONSI. REA independently
evaluated the above listed documents and other available information and believes that modified design and additional
monitoring requirements included in the APP will ensure that future expansion or movement of the fissure and associated
seepage from the ponds is detected. These measures should preclude the potential for adverse impacts to groundwater
quality in the vicinity of the proposed facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with REA Environmental Policies and Procedures for Electric and Telephone Borrowers, 7 CFR Part 1794,
AEPCO published notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Willcox Range News 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on May 5 and 12, 1994. The notices announced REA's decision to reassess its FONSI determination of February 12, 1993,
described the documentation upon which the reassessment would be based, and identified locations within Cochise
County at which these materials could be reviewed. The comments received did not identify any issues or concerns relating
to the project that: (1) had not been addressed by the appropriate regulatory authority; or (2) had not been previously
brought to REA's attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the amended finding of no significant impact is available for review at, or can be obtained from, REA at the

 Improved Oscillating Tube Densimeter
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The oscillating tube densimeter provides a unique measurement of fluid density. The invention consists of an electrically
conducting tube, through which the fluid is passed, surrounded by a magnet. A current passed through the tube thus
generates electromagnetic forces. These forces, in turn, generate a resonant frequency in the tube which can be accurately
determined through a measurement of the induced voltage. Since the resonant frequency is dependent on the density
of the fluid, it can thus be correlated to this induced voltage.

 Optical Technique for Monitoring Electrochemical Interfaces

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 This invention allows real time measurement of the progress of a chemical reaction at an electrochemical interface.
This is done by utilizing a coherent light source, without removing the solid interface from the sample and without
stopping the chemical reaction. The light sources used in the invention, which can include a helium neon laser or a
solid state laser, monitor the progress of a reaction by detecting changes in reactionary surface roughness and polarizability.
A wide range of chemical reactions may be measured, including, for example, metal finishing, electrochemical machining,
corrosion protection, metal deposition, electrochemical production, waste water treatment, or electrowining.

 The Secretary gives notice of the closing date for receipt of State applications for fiscal year 1994 funds

Secretary under which a State Postsecondary Review Entity (SPRE) designated by the State conducts or coordinates
reviews of certain institutions of higher education that are either referred to the SPRE by the Secretary or selected
by the State. To the extent of available appropriations, and a State's allotment from those appropriations, the Secretary
reimburses a State for the costs incurred in carrying out its agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary is authorized to accept applications from the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Northwest Expansion
II Projects </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
July 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 10, 1993 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent To Prepare
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Northwest Expansion II Projects in the above dockets and related
projects proposed by Paiute Pipeline Company (Paiute) in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;751&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;29&hyph;000
(Paiute Expansion II Projects). The purpose of the notice was to request comments on environmental issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 14 and June 15, 1994 Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) filed amendments to its two original applications
that represent a change in the scope of the Northwest Expansion II Projects. Based on the changes in the amended filings,
we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an EIS is the more appropriate document for
analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with Northwest's projects. The cooperating Federal
agencies agree with this strategy. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis the important changes are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The deletion of 8 pipeline loops from the projects, which reduces the total miles of pipeline construction
from 177.2 miles to 54.9 miles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The deletion of 11 compressor station modifications, which reduces the required compression from 88,235
horsepower (hp) to 14,820 hp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The addition of 5.8 miles of 20-inch-diameter loop in Marion County, Oregon (the Salem Loop) and 1,070 hp at
the existing Pegram Compressor Station in Bear Lake County, Idaho that were not part of the original proposals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The deletion of 26 of the 37 originally proposed meter station modifications; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The change in pipeline routing of both the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The termination of service agreements by all shippers that had proposed to have Northwest deliver gas to Paiute
for ultimate delivery to customers in Nevada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of facilities proposed in the amended filings are in appendix 1 and maps showing the location of the Salem Loop,
the Pegram Compressor Station, and the amended routing for the Gresham Loop and Weyerhaeuser Lateral are attached
as appendix 2.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of the environmental analysis Northwest's two applications will be considered together because
the construction of the Gresham Loop is common to both applications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facilities proposed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001 include the increase in compression at the Washougal
Compressor Station; the construction of the Gresham Loop, 1.3 miles of the Salem Loop (milepost 64.1 to 65.3), and
the Johnson Creek Meter Station; and the upgrading of six existing meter stations. The remaining facilities are part
of Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;000.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The length and location of the Gresham Loop is the same in both applications; however, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;613&hyph;001
Northwest proposes using 20-inch-diameter pipeline, while Docket No. CP93&hyph;673&hyph;00 proposes using 30-inch-diameter
pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The termination of all contracts that called for Northwest to deliver gas to Paiute effectively severs the connection
between Northwest's and Paiute's proposals; therefore, only Northwest's proposed facilities will be included
in the EA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The EA Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity. Our EA will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concludes that the projects
would result in significant environmental impacts, we will prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise
we will prepare a Finding of No Significant Impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to
separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Local scoping meetings have
already been held for the original projects. Additional scoping meetings are not planned. We are asking for comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on those portions of the projects where the routing has been changed or the facilities were 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 part of the original proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will discuss impacts that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Soils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the projects, or portions of the projects, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state,
and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries,
and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings.

Take notice that on July 1, 1994 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL) tendered for filing as part of its
FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, Ninth Revised Sheet No. 60, which tariff sheet is proposed to be effective
on August 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that the instant filing is submitted pursuant to Section 39 of the General Terms and Conditions of TGPL's
FERC Gas Tariff which provides that TGPL will file to adjust its Great Plains Volumetric Surcharge (GPS) 30 days prior
to each GPS Annual Period beginning August 1. The GPS Surcharge is designed to recover: (i) The cost of gas purchased
from Great Plains Gasification Associates (or its successor) which exceeds the Spot Index (as defined in Section
39 of the General Terms), and (ii) the related cost of transporting such gas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised GPS Surcharge included therein consists of two components_the Current GPS Surcharge calculated for
the period August 1, 1994 through July 31, 1995 plus the Great Plains Deferred Account Surcharge (Deferred Surcharge).
The determination of the Deferred Surcharge is based on the balance in the current GPS subaccount plus accumulated
interest at April 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL states that included in Appendix A attached to the filing are workpapers supporting the calculation of the revised
GPS Surcharge of $0.0287 per dt reflected on the tariff sheet included therein.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Western Area Power Administration (Western) is proposing a methodology to determine annual charges to accompany
the independent marketing of Provo River Project (PRP) resources. A previous proposal to integrate this project
and its resources with Western's Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated Projects) was not supported
by customers. To date, PRP's resources have been sold to the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) at a rate to cover
project costs. Western proposes that capacity and energy produced by the PRP be marketed to those members of two Western
customers, Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah Municipal Power Agency (UMPA), located in
the area of the Provo River drainage, in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. Power will be allocated to these two customers
proportional to the electrical sales of their members who meet the criteria for receiving it. These customers will
pay all of the annual expenses of the PRP, including an amount to be used to assist the Provo River Water Users Association's
(Water Users) timely repayment of the original Federal investment in the PRP. In return, these customers will receive
all of the total marketable output of the PRP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rate methodology constitutes a minor rate adjustment as defined by the procedures for public participation
in general rate adjustments covered in 10 CFR 903.2(f). The PRP annual sales are less than 100 million kilowatthours
and installed capacity is less than 20,000 kilowatts. A 30-day comment period will begin with the publication of this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and end 30 days thereafter. After review of public comments, Western will recommend a proposed rate methodology
for establishing the annual charge to be approved on an interim basis by the Deputy Secretary of DOE. The proposed rate
methodology will be sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval on a final basis. The proposed rate
methodology for marketing capacity and energy is expected to become effective November 1, 1994, and it will remain
in effect until October 31, 1999, unless superseded by another rate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present there is no existing PRP rate. Energy has been sold to the CRSP at an amount that meets the PRP's annual revenue
requirements for expenses and repayment obligations.

Background Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction of the PRP was begun in May 1938, with the powerplant completed in 1958. It has a present generating capacity
of 5 megawatts of power. The Water Users, a corporation of stockholders owning prorated water entitlements, executed
contract No. Ilr&hyph;874 in 1936, with the Federal Government to construct and repay project facilities. Contract
No. Ilr&hyph;1082, dated December 20, 1938, established a contract among several entities to compensate the Utah
Power and Light Company with PRP power in exchange for power foregone at its powerplant. Only energy excess to project
purposes has been available for Federal marketing. Since 1963, CRSP has needed additional energy and has purchased
the available PRP energy at an amount established annually for the PRP to cover its costs, including operation, maintenance,
and replacement costs and repayment expenses. These expenses have included $1.623 million of irrigation assistance
to the Water Users. PRP's original power investment has been repaid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1993, Western proposed to change the way it marketed power and energy produced by PRP in response to customer
interest in its available resources. The part of the proposal that suggested inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated
Projects was not supported by customers for various reasons, thereby requiring Western to modify its original proposal
to one which will market PRP's power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Two Western customers, ICPA
and UMPA, pursued acquiring the available PRP capacity and energy. The members of these customers are located in the
PRP drainage area in Utah and Wasatch Counties. Western proposes that these customers receive all of the total marketable
output, with the power allocated proportionally to their eligible members' energy sales. ICPA and UMPA would pay
all of the annual expenses of the project. An amount to meet the repayment assistance to the Water Users would be recovered
under separate agreement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Methodology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If Western adopts the proposal, Western will prepare a power repayment study (PRS) annually for PRP to establish the
revenue needed to meet annual costs, including operation, maintenance, and replacement repayment costs and interest.
Budgeted estimates of these future costs will be used in the PRS. The power assistance to the Water Users will not be
included in the PRS but will, instead, be paid under a separate arrangement among the Bureau of Reclamation, Western,
ICPA, UMPA, and the Water Users which will provide for equal annual installments of $102,285.71 over 14 years.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the proposed methodology is adopted and PRP energy is no longer sold to the CRSP, it will be necessary to collect the
PRP's share of transmission costs in Utah under contract No. 2436 with PacifiCorp. Assigning proportional shares
of Western's Tier 1 and Tier 2 costs will result in an annual transmission expense of approximately $30,348. This amount
also will be included as an annual expense of the PRP. The annual revenue requirement of the PRP, as determined by the
PRS, will then be prorated between ICPA and UMPA and divided by 12 for monthly billing to the customers. The rate methodology
used to determine the annual revenue requirement will be recalculated each year during the 5-year period that the
methodology is proposed to be in effect.

By Amendment No. 3 to Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;108, published November 10, 1993 (58 FR 58716), the Secretary
of Energy delegated (1) The authority to develop long-term power and transmission rates on a nonexclusive basis to
the Administrator of Western; (2) the authority to confirm, approve, and place such rates into effect on an interim
basis to the Deputy Secretary; and (3) the authority to confirm, approve, and place into effect on a final basis, to
remand, or to disapprove such rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Existing DOE procedures for public
participation in power rate adjustments (10 CFR Part 903) became effective on September 18, 1985 (50 FR 37835).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All brochures, studies, comments, letters, memorandums, and other documents made or kept by Western for the purpose
of developing the proposed rate methodology for capacity and energy are and will be made available for inspection
and copying at the Salt Lake City Area Office located at 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), each agency, when required by 5 U.S.C. 553 to publish a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available
for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the proposed rule on small
entities. In this instance, the initiation of the PRP rate proposal is related to nonregulatory services provided
by Western at a particular rate. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), rules of particular applicability relating to rates or services
are not considered rules within the meaning of the act. Since the PRP capacity and energy rate methodology is of limited
applicability, no flexibility analysis is required.

Determination Under Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive
Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866;
accordingly, no clearance of this notice by Office of Management and Budget is required.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1987 and 1989 the Board authorized bank holding companies to establish separate nonbank subsidiaries (``section
20 subsidiaries'') to underwrite and deal in securities that a bank may not underwrite and deal in directly (``ineligible
securities''). In order to ensure compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), the Board
required that the amount of revenue a section 20 subsidiary derives from ineligible securities underwriting and
dealing activities may not exceed 10 percent of the total revenue of the subsidiary. Section 20 prohibits a member
bank of the Federal Reserve System from being affiliated with a company that is ``engaged principally'' in underwriting
and dealing in securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In January 1993, after notice and the opportunity for public comment, the Board authorized section 20 subsidiaries
to use an alternative indexed method to compute compliance with the 10 percent revenue limitation to account for unusual
changes in the level and structure of interest rates since 1989, when the 10 percent limit was adopted. When the Board
adopted the indexed revenue test, the Board deferred adoption of another alternative test for the 10 percent limit
that would be based on assets, rather than revenue. Inasmuch as the Board has had increased experience in reviewing
and monitoring the operations and activities of the section 20 subsidiaries, and in order to allow these subsidiaries
additional flexibility in the conduct of their securities operations, the Board now proposes to modify its orders
approving the establishment of the section 20 subsidiaries to allow such subsidiaries the option of using an alternative
measure to the revenue-based tests for assessing compliance with the 10 percent limit. The Board requests comment
on whether asset values, sales volume data, or both measures should be used as a new alternative to the revenue test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Ten Percent Limit on Ineligible Securities Activities of Section 20 Subsidiaries
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Beginning with orders issued in 1987, the Board has authorized bank holding companies to establish nonbank subsidiaries
(``section 20 subsidiaries'') to underwrite and deal in securities that a bank may not underwrite and deal in directly
(``ineligible securities'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to assure compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Board limited the amount of ineligible
securities that these section 20 subsidiaries could underwrite and deal in. Section 20 provides that a member bank
may not be affiliated with a company that is ``engaged principally'' in underwriting and dealing in securities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In particular, the Board determined that a bank affiliate would not be ``engaged principally'' in ineligible securities
activities for purposes of section 20 if those activities were not substantial relative to the other activities of
the subsidiary. The Board ruled that ineligible securities activities are not a substantial part of a subsidiary's
business if the gross revenue derived from those activities does not exceed 10 percent of the total gross revenues
of the subsidiary, when revenue is averaged over a rolling 8-quarter period. Subject to this limitation, the Board
has approved the establishment of over 30 section 20 subsidiaries, several of which are authorized to underwrite
and deal in debt and equity securities generally.

B. Adoption of Alternative Indexed Revenue Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In July 1992, the Board proposed to establish two alternative methods that a section 20 subsidiary could elect to use
to determine compliance with the 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities in place of the gross revenue
test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In proposing these alternative tests, the Board noted that historically unusual changes in the level and structure
of interest rates have distorted the revenue test as a measure of the relative importance of ineligible securities
activities in a manner that was not anticipated when the 10 percent limit was adopted in 1989.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To address this problem, the Board first proposed an alternative revenue test indexed to interest rate changes that
would allow for adjustment of the current revenue of a section 20 subsidiary to account for the unanticipated interest
rate conditions. In January 1993, the Board adopted an optional alternative indexed revenue test.

The Board pointed out that, in contrast to conditions in 1989, there was an unusually wide difference between short-
and long-term rates. Since eligible securities tend to be shorter term than ineligible securities, the unusually
sharp increase in the steepness of the yield curve had the effect of making it appear, based on revenue data, that the
eligible securities activities of at least some section 20 subsidiaries had been reduced, even though the relative
proportion of eligible and ineligible securities activities being conducted by those subsidiaries remained essentially
the same.

79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 226 (1993). Under the indexed revenue test, current interest and dividend revenues from
eligible and ineligible activities for each quarter are increased or decreased by an adjustment factor provided
by the Board based on the average duration of a section 20 subsidiary's eligible and ineligible securities portfolio.
The adjustment factors, which vary according to specific time periods of average duration, represent the ratio of
interest rates on Treasury securities in the most recent quarter to those in September 1989.

C. Proposed Asset-Based Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time that the indexed revenue test was proposed, the Board also proposed an alternative asset-based test.
Specifically, the Board proposed that the 10 percent limit would be computed by using average daily assets held in
connection with ineligible securities activities and with other activities. The Board recognized that in 1987,
when it initially decided to use revenue as the appropriate measure of the section 20 limit on ineligible securities
activities, the Board had expressed two concerns about a test based on average assets. One concern was that an asset-based
test might be manipulated, for example, through ``matched book'' repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
for government securities. The second concern was that an average asset test, even if computed on a daily basis, would
not include securities that were underwritten by the section 20 subsidiary but that were held only for a few hours,
which is typical in many underwriting transactions. Accordingly, when the Board proposed an alternative asset-based
test in 1992, the Board requested comment on possible modifications to address these concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of banking organizations commenting on the Board's proposal supported adoption of an asset-based alternative
measure for computing the 10 percent limit. These comments stated that, like the indexed revenue proposal, a limit
based on assets would be less susceptible than the unadjusted revenue test to unusual changes in interest rate conditions.
Those supporting the asset-based test also stated that this test would be easier and less costly to apply than a measure
that required adjustments to revenue data and would allow for greater predictability in the management of the operations
of the subsidiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters also opposed establishing any specific restrictions to address the potential for manipulative
transactions. These commenters believed that the capital and funding requirements needed to support such transactions,
as well as earnings considerations and market-imposed credit risk constraints, would effectively curtail the excessive
use of asset transactions conducted solely to increase the level of eligible assets. Commenters also observed that
implementation of such separate limits would be difficult in practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the question of the treatment of intra-day holdings of securities that are being underwritten, while there was
some support for including the value of such securities for purposes of applying an asset-based test, other comments
opposed counting the value of such holdings on the grounds that the 10 percent limit should measure only assets that
pose a risk to the section 20 subsidiary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments, the Board decided to defer adoption of an alternative asset-based test, noting
that the Board was not then able to assess the potential practical effect of the test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Proposed Alternative Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Need for an Improved Alternative to the Gross Revenue Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the decision to defer consideration of the asset-based test, the Board has had a greater opportunity to review
and analyze the operations of section 20 subsidiaries. At the outset, the Board notes that, during this time period
and in the entire seven year period since the Board first approved the creation of section 20 subsidiaries, the Board
has not uncovered evidence of unsafe or unsound practices, conflicts of interest, or other conduct related to the
operations of these subsidiaries that has impaired the condition of the affiliated depository institutions or the
banking organizations as a whole. The available evidence further suggests that these subsidiaries have exerted
a beneficial procompetitive influence on the securities markets in which they compete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the section 20 subsidiaries were first authorized, the Board selected revenue, rather than asset values or sales
volume, as the best overall measure of ineligible securities activities because the Board believed that such a test
would pose the fewest operational difficulties and provide the most accurate indication of the relative importance
of specific activities. The Board also noted that although the applicants had argued that a variety of factors could
be used to judge ``engaged principally'' status, a single uniform standard was desirable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, subsequent events have shown that the susceptibility of results from the gross revenue measure to distortion
caused by changes in interest rate conditions casts doubt on the appropriateness of that test. Although the indexed
revenue test addresses these concerns, it necessarily involves increased operational difficulties. For some section
20 subsidiaries, the costs and resources needed to implement the indexed revenue test, with the need for complicated
duration models and the calculation of the duration of all securities in a section 20 subsidiary's portfolio on a regular
basis, may provide a disincentive for using that test.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, and in order to provide additional flexibility to section 20 subsidiaries in the conduct of authorized
activities, the Board now believes it is desirable to consider adoption of another optional measure in addition to
revenue for applying 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities. The Board believes that either asset
values or sales volume, or a combination of both measures, should be considered as a new alternative measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Asset-Based Test as an Alternative Measure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any asset-based test would limit a section 20 subsidiary's average daily assets held in connection with underwriting
and dealing in ineligible securities to 10 percent of its total average daily assets, computed on a rolling 8-quarter
basis. Because, as the Board observed when an asset-based test was previously proposed, a measure relying on asset
values would be less sensitive to unanticipated changes in interest rate conditions than a test based on revenues,
such a test would address these distortions. Also, it appears that for at least some section 20 subsidiaries a test
relying on asset values may be easier in practice to apply than the indexed revenue test. Moreover, as explained below,
in light of its greater experience with the operations of the section 20 subsidiaries, the Board is now of the view that
the concerns previously expressed about the operation of an asset-based test can be appropriately mitigated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the use of assets acquired in connection with particular types of securities activities may
represent a permissible measure of compliance with the statutory limitation in section 20 on ineligible securities
activities. Asset values do provide a rough approximation of risk to the section 20 subsidiary, and risk to banking
organizations was one of the concerns behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Board notes that the New York State
Banking Department, in applying a state law restriction on the level of ineligible securities activities of affiliates
of state-chartered banks, allows the use of either assets or revenue as a measure of compliance with the law.

Underwriting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that, if an asset-based test is adopted as an alternative measure, the value of any securities underwritten
by a subsidiary would have to be accounted for in computing average daily assets, even where the securities are disposed
of prior to the end of the day. The literal language of section 20 covers any underwriting activity. Thus, under the
proposed asset-based test, if securities underwritten by a section 20 subsidiary are recorded as assets of the subsidiary,
but are disposed of before the end of the day on which underwriting activity takes place, then the securities would
be treated as if they were carried as assets on the books of the subsidiary as of the end of that day. If securities are
underwritten by the section 20 subsidiary on a ``best efforts'' or agency basis the securities would be treated as
assets of the subsidiary for each day that underwriting activity occurs with respect to that particular security.

Under an asset-based alternative measure, similar treatment would be accorded an entire issue of privately-placed
securities when any portion of the issue is taken into inventory pursuant to SEC Rule 144A.

Anti-Manipulation Limits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Should an asset-based test be adopted as an alternative measure, the Board does not propose that any specific limits
be incorporated to address the potential for manipulative transactions carried out solely to inflate artificially
a section 20 subsidiary's base of eligible assets. Many of the comments on the previously proposed asset-based test
stated that there are sufficient financial and market constraints on the holding of excessive eligible securities
solely to support increased ineligible securities activities. Even in the case of matched book-type transactions,
counterparties typically impose limits on the amount of transactions they will engage in with any particular section
20 subsidiary, in order to control credit risk. The Board's minimum consolidated leverage ratio and the SEC's net
capital rule, which is applicable to a section 20 subsidiary, would impose additional constraints. In addition,
the acquisition of significant amounts of eligible securities by a section 20 subsidiary in matched book or similar
transactions would also tend to have an overall negative impact on the earnings performance of the consolidated bank
holding company organization, given the small profit margins typical in such transactions. Finally, the Board believes
that it has the authority to take appropriate corrective action where manipulative transactions are detected.

C. Sales Volume Test as Alternative Measure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is also requesting comment on adoption of sales volume as an alternative measure. If sales volume data is
used as the measure of an alternative test for applying the 10 percent limit, then the dollar volume of a section 20 subsidiary's
sales of ineligible securities as a result of underwriting and dealing in such securities could not be allowed to exceed
10 percent of its total sales volume over a rolling 8-quarter period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the value of various types of securities and other assets sold by a section 20 subsidiary bears
a relationship to the subsidiary's level of activity with respect to each type of security or other asset. Use of such
data is thus consistent with the statutory requirements. Under a sales volume test, intra-day transactions like
underwriting and dealing sales would be automatically covered, even if the assets involved were not recorded on the
subsidiary's books at the end of the day. In addition, like an asset-based test, a sales volume test would be less sensitive
to changes in interest rate relationships. Such a test may also be easier to comply with than the current alternative
of indexed revenues.

Repurchase Transactions and Other Sales Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One question raised by the use of sales volume as a test of the 10 percent limit is whether securities repurchase agreements
(``repo transactions'') should be treated as ``sales'' and therefore covered under such a test. Repo transactions
are hybrids, having some characteristics of collateralized lending and some characteristics of an outright sale
of securities. The Federal Reserve, for purposes of open market operations, has taken the position that repo transactions
are sales rather than loans. The Board requests comment on how repo transactions should be treated for purposes of
a sales volume test, if such a test were adopted as an appropriate alternative measure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Board invites comments concerning reporting and other administrative issues associated with implementing
a sales volume test. The Board specifically requests comment on how sales volume should be computed for various types
of transactions involving the same kinds of underlying securities in different market places. For example, Treasury
bonds may be sold in the cash market, on a ``When Issued'' basis, on a forward contract basis, or indirectly, by purchasing
a put option or selling a futures contract. Although each type of transaction may be reported differently for balance
sheet purposes, all of the various kinds of transactions may have an identical impact on the section 20 subsidiary's
risk profile.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is considering adopting instructions similar to those contained in the current Federal Reserve Report
Series Form FR 2004, Schedule B ``Weekly Report of Cumulative Dealer Transactions'' for collection of sales volume
information. Accordingly, comments are requested concerning whether the instructions and definitions for reporting
sales volume data in the FR 2004 would provide an adequate basis for developing sales volume reporting for section
20 subsidiaries. Comments are also requested concerning the definition and reporting of various types of transactions
that are not addressed in the existing FR 2004 report instructions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Manipulative Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Board first approved the establishment of the section 20 subsidiaries, it considered and rejected using
a sales volume test, on the ground that the eligible securities sales volume of a section 20 subsidiary, like asset
values, could be easily inflated by repeated matched book transactions intended for no other purpose than to inflate
the subsidiary's eligible sales volume base.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, many of the comments on the previously proposed asset-based test pointed out the credit risk and market
limitations on the extent to which a section 20 subsidiary may engage in matched book or similar transactions. While
these limits may be less effective where a section 20 subsidiary engages in unusual sales of securities with its own
affiliate, rather than with a third party, solely for the purpose of increasing the volume of eligible securities
sales, these matters can be addressed during the examination process and, as noted above, corrective action can be
taken where manipulative transactions are found.

D. Compliance With Both Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A possible means for addressing the disadvantages of asset values and sales volume alone as appropriate measures
is to require a section 20 subsidiary electing an alternative test to comply with both measures. The Board seeks comment
on this possible requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Implementation of Any Alternative Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board notes that comments received on the asset-based test previously proposed suggested that, if such a test
were adopted, some section 20 subsidiaries may not have access to sufficiently detailed asset data for earlier quarters
to allow computation of such a test on a rolling 8-quarter basis and may not be able to obtain this information easily.
Therefore, the Board proposes that, if an alternative measure is adopted using either asset values or sales volume,
or a combination of both measures, a section 20 subsidiary would be allowed, at its election, initially to comply with
such a test on a prospective basis only for the first two-year period. The Board followed this approach when the indexed
revenue test was adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was also the case with respect to adoption of the indexed revenue test, the Board proposes that, regardless of which
test may be adopted as an alternative measure, any section 20 subsidiary electing to use a new test would be required
to continue using that test for a period of at least two years, in order to prevent frequent switching between tests
that would impair an accurate assessment of the relative importance of the subsidiary's ineligible securities activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Proposed Elimination of Indexed Revenue Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also seeks comment as to why, if a new alternative measure is adopted, the indexed revenue test should not
be eliminated because there would no longer be a need for that alternative measure. However, a section 20 subsidiary
would be allowed to continue to elect to use the unadjusted revenue test, if the subsidiary wishes to avoid the costs
associated with converting to any new test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Proposed Modification of Board Orders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes that its orders approving the establishment of section 20 subsidiaries be modified to provide
that a section 20 subsidiary may elect, as an alternative to the existing revenue tests, to apply an asset-based test
to assess compliance with the 10 percent limit on ineligible securities activities. Under such a test, a section 20
subsidiary would be viewed as in compliance with that section for any quarter if the average daily assets held in connection
with underwriting and dealing in ineligible securities for that quarter, when added to the average daily assets held
in connection with ineligible securities activities for the previous seven quarters, does not exceed 10 percent
of the average daily total assets of the subsidiary for that quarter and for the seven previous quarters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Securities underwritten by the subsidiary, including securities taken into inventory in a private placement pursuant
to SEC Rule 144A, would be treated as assets of the subsidiary for each day underwriting activity takes place with respect
to such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the alternative, the Board proposes that section 20 subsidiaries be authorized to elect to apply, as an alternative
to the existing revenue test, a sales volume test to assess compliance with the 10 percent limit. Under such a test,
a section 20 subsidiary would be viewed as in compliance with that section for any quarter if the total dollar volume
of sales of ineligible securities from underwriting and dealing activities for that quarter, when added to the total
dollar volume of such sales for the previous seven quarters, does not exceed 10 percent of the total dollar volume of
sales of all securities and other assets by the subsidiary for that quarter and for the seven previous quarters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as a third alternative, the Board proposes that section 20 subsidiaries be authorized to apply an alternative
test measured by both asset values and sales volume. Under such a test, a section 20 subsidiary would be viewed as in
compliance with section 20 for any quarter if the subsidiary simultaneously satisfied both the asset-based and sales
volume measures described above.

Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these awards is to assist State and local health departments in: (1) Determining the sensitivity, timeliness,
and validity of the AIDS surveillance system; (2) Improving the efficiency of AIDS surveillance by evaluating a variety
of case ascertainment methods; and (3) Identifying the information collected as part of AIDS surveillance that is
most useful for planning and evaluating HIV-related treatment and preventive services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All activities should be implemented under various reporting alternatives (provider-based vs. lab-initiated
reporting) through a population-based retrospective study.

A. Recipient Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Conduct a retrospective evaluation of medical and laboratory records to obtain histories of CD4+ and HIV testing,
the occurrence of opportunistic infections (OIs) among persons reported to AIDS surveillance, and the number and
type of sites that provide care for HIV-infected persons to determine the sensitivity, validity, and timeliness
of AIDS surveillance and the ability to effectively monitor the epidemic using the 1993 AIDS surveillance definition
and reporting system. As needed, conduct personal interviews with all, or a sample of, persons who are reported with
AIDS to retrospectively collect data on dates and results of all prior CD4+ and HIV tests, OIs, receipt of treatment
and prophylaxis, and degree of access to the health care system. If the cases being investigated received treatment
in multiple health facilities, as many records as possible should be pursued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Propose alternative surveillance methods to increase the cost effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of case-finding.
For example, areas with provider-based surveillance can pilot a laboratory-initiated reporting system and compare
this activity to existing surveillance methods. For areas with both provider and laboratory-initiated case-finding
methods, evaluative methods may include comparing data from these sources to alternative data bases. The alternative
data bases used for evaluation should not currently be linked to case-finding activities, and may vary by State (e.g.,
death certificates are used for case-finding in most areas, and are therefore not useful for evaluation activities).
Other methods to increase efficiency may be explored in comparison to existing case-finding methods, including:
sampling for risk information; reporting only from laboratory and alternative data bases, such as death registries;
and conducting active surveillance for preventable opportunistic infections only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Collect data in the treatment and services referral section of the adult HIV/AIDS confidential case report form
on all or a representative sample of persons reported to AIDS surveillance, describe the data sources, the collection
methods, and determine resources needed to obtain these data. Develop measures to assess the usefulness of these
data for the planning of prevention activities by the local health department and community planning bodies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Participate in meetings to plan and develop standardized evaluation protocols and to discuss progress and methodologic
issues. If travel is needed it will be supported through specific funds awarded in this cooperative agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Ensure confidentiality of information collected from persons with AIDS and persons with confirmed or suspected
HIV infection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Maintain responsibility for analysis and presentation of data collected for local purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Demonstrate coordination with existing HIV/AIDS surveillance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Identify and select appropriate staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

Applications are subject to Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.)
12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications.
Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point
of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions
on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC
for each State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any State process recommendations
on applications submitted to CDC, they should send them to Edwin L. Dixon, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management
Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road,
NE., Room 314, Mailstop E&hyph;18, Atlanta, GA 30305. The due date for State process recommendations is 30 days after
the application deadline date for new and competing continuation awards. (A waiver for the 60 day requirement has
been requested.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process recommendations
it receives after that date. Indian tribes are strongly encouraged to request tribal government review of the proposed
application. If tribal governments have any tribal process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they
should forward them to Edwin L. Dixon, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants
Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Room 314, Mailstop E&hyph;18,
Atlanta, GA 30305. This should be done no later than 30 days after the application deadline date for new and competing

<DOCTITLE>Cooperative Agreement To Establish a Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Initiative Program for African-Americans</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement program to develop a health promotion and disease prevention initiative to reduce preventable
death, sickness, and disability; to reduce disparities in health; and to enhance the quality of life among African-Americans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to all the priority areas of Healthy People 2000 as well as the 1985 Secretary's
Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000'' or the ``Report of the
Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health,'' see the section

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is authorized under Sections 301 (42 U.S.C. 241) and 317(k)(2) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)) of the Public Health
Service Act, as amended, and the President's Executive Order 12876 of 1993.

Smoke-Free Workplace
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible applicants are National Minority Organizations (NMOs) and/or Regional Minority Organizations (RMOs)
which principally serve African-American populations. The African-American population is very diverse and more
targeted strategies and activities are needed to reduce the growing health gap among this group. Consistent with
the 1985 Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health, excess mortality, morbidity and disability
continues to disproportionately affect African-Americans. A more current update of that report documents continuing
excess deaths specifically for African-Americans. Eligible applicants must submit documentation to demonstrate
that they comply with the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are an established tax-exempt organization (a nongovernmental, tax-exempt corporation or association whose
net earnings in no part lawfully accrue to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals). The following is acceptable
evidence of tax-exempt status: (i) A reference to the applicant's organization in the Internal Revenue Service's
(IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code; or (ii) a copy of
a currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Have a governing body or board that is composed of more than 50% racial or ethnic minority group members who are representative
of the population to be served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Have a minimum of 12 months documented experience in operating and centrally administering a coordinated public
health or related program serving racial or ethnic minority populations within a major portion or region (multistate
or multiterritory) of the United States through its own offices, organizational affiliates, or the participation
of other minority organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Have a specific charge from the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or a resolution from its governing body or board
to operate nationally or regionally (multistate or multiterritory) within the United States and its Territories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Organizations participating in the program must have agreements with their affiliates, chapters, or other minority
organizations that each organization must have a governing body or board whose membership is composed of more than
50% racial or ethnic minority group members who are representative of the population to be served.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A minimum of $100,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund one award. Additional funds are expected. It is expected that the
award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years.
Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on
the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal purpose of the cooperative agreement is to assist an NMO or RMO to establish the following three components:
a Health Program Unit, a Speakers Bureau, and a National Health Network. This will allow the awardee to use these components
for the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Health Program Unit:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The awardee will implement preventive strategies to improve the health of African-Americans by targeting the seven
leading causes of excess deaths in this population. The Health Program Unit will also develop and implement strategies
to improve the utilization of community health resources by African-Americans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speakers Bureau:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The awardee will organize a National Speakers Bureau of health professionals and other professionals to provide
oral presentations on salient health promotion and disease prevention topics relating to African-Americans at
national, State, and local meetings. Other organizations will have ready access to the Speakers Bureau to assist
in improving disease prevention and health promotion activities in their areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Health Network:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The awardee will assist minority organizations to: (1) Expand their internal and external organizational networks,
and (2) facilitate the dissemination of health promotion and disease prevention information to African-Americans.
This network will use the communication systems that already exist in the community to assist in reaching the target
audience.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations
of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation
or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public
health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and
public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites
that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies,
health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research,
emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental
dose reconstruction for DOE's Savannah River Site near Augusta, Georgia, as well as a worker study at the same site,
the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of South Carolina and Georgia citizens to
provide consensus advice to CDC and ATSDR regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking
steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research
at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft charter for this proposed committee states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each
DOE site, operational guidelines at each site must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and
the responsibilities of the committee members and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public
meetings to begin developing operational guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of this meeting will be to
update the public on the status of CDC's and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice and
recommendations from interested parties concerning selection criteria and operating procedures.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 20, 1994, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received a Notice of Staking (NOS) for a proposed well in the
Blackleaf Unit. The proposed well is located in northwestern Teton County about 25 miles northwest of Choteau, Montana.
The NOS is the first step in the process and allows an operator to survey a location and access route to a proposed well.
An Application for Permit to Drill (APD) including the subsurface plan (which details the drilling program) and the
surface use plan (which describes any surface disturbances) will be submitted to BLM following an onsite inspection.
Upon receipt of the APD, the BLM will analyze the proposal.

Patrick D. Broe, The Broe Companies, The Great Western Railway Company, Railco Inc., Chicago West Pullman Transportation
Corp., et al._Corporate Family Reorganization Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 9, 1994, Patrick D. Broe (Mr. Broe), The Broe Companies, Inc. (BCI), The Great Western Railway Company (GWR),
Railco Inc. (Railco), Chicago West Pullman Transportation Corp. (CWPT), OmniTRAX, Inc. (OmniTRAX), and their carrier
subsidiaries jointly filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3) to reorganize the carrier subsidiaries
and for OmniTRAX, a noncarrier holding company, to control the carrier subsidiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Broe is a noncarrier individual who directly controls Panhandle Northern Railroad Company (PNR) and Central
Kansas Railway Limited Liability Company (CKR) and who also owns and controls BCI and OmniTRAX. BCI is a noncarrier
holding company that directly controls the noncarriers GWR and Railco. GWR directly controls the carriers Great
Western Railway of Colorado, Inc. (GWRC), Great Western Railway Company of Iowa, Inc. (GWRI), and Great Western Railway
of Oregon, Inc. (GWRO). Railco controls the noncarrier CWPT, which in turn controls six class III railroads: the Chicago,
West Pullman &amp; Southern Railroad Company (CWP&amp;S); the Georgia Woodlands Railroad Company (GWRR); The Newburgh
&amp; South Shore Railroad Company (NSR); Chicago Rail Link (CRL); Manufacturers' Junction Railway Company (MJR);
and Kansas Southwestern Railway Company (KSW). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the reorganization, MJR, CWP&amp;S, GWRR, KSW, CRL, GWRI, PNR and GWRC will be reformed as limited liability
companies. GWRO will remain a corporation. NSR will be reformed as a limited liability partnership. BCI will convey
its interest in GWR, Railco and CWPT to OmniTRAX and the GWR, Railco and CWPT holding companies will be dissolved. Mr.
Broe will transfer his direct controlling interests in PNR and CKR to OmniTRAX. As a result of these transactions,
OmniTRAX will control all 11 rail carriers (MJR, CWP&amp;S, GWRR, KSW, CRL, GWRI, PNR, GWRC, NSR, CKR and GWRO). Mr
Broe will continue to control OmniTRAX. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parties intend to consummate the transactions on or after June 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These transactions are within a corporate family of the type specifically exempted from prior review and approval
under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). The parties say that the transactions will not result in adverse changes in service levels,
significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family.
The stated purpose of the reorganization is to obtain better tax treatment, to facilitate estate planning, and to
simplify the corporate structure, which should allow a more efficient operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the transactions will be protected by
the conditions set forth in

will not automatically stay the transactions. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Karl Morell,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 5, 1992, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause
to Steven E. Warren, M.D. (Respondent), of Salt Lake City, Utah, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration,
AW1662609, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged
that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21
U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), in that the Respondent was personally abusing narcotic controlled substances and obscured
this use from others; that Respondent misused his registration privilege to obtain Schedule II controlled substances
for other than legitimate medical purposes; that Respondent failed to maintain complete and accurate controlled
substance records; that Respondent failed to account for 40 to 50 multi-dose vials of Demerol; that Respondent added
saline solution to a commercial vial of Demerol in an effort to mislead investigators; and that Respondent distributed
controlled substance samples without a legitimate medical purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, citing his preliminary finding that Respondent's continued registration posed an imminent danger
to the public health and safety, the Administrator ordered the immediate suspension of DEA Certificate of Registration,
AW1662609, during the pendency of these proceedings. 21 U.S.C. 824(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent, by counsel, responded to the Order to Show Cause and requested a hearing. The matter was docketed before
Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. A hearing was held in Salt Lake City, Utah on July 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 6, 1993, the administrative law judge issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended
ruling in which he recommended, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
iner alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the Respondent's DEA registration be revoked and that any pending applications be denied. The administrative
law judge also recommended that the Administrator grant the Respondent alternative relief in the form of a waiver
of DEA regulations to permit the San Juan County Hospital to employ Respondent and permit him to order controlled substances
for hospital patients. The Government filed exceptions to this recommendation, and the Respondent filed a response
to the Government's exceptions. The administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Acting Administrator
on November 8, 1993. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,
enters his final order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent graduated from medical school with the assistance of a National
Service Corps scholarship, and was subsequently assigned to a remote county in Utah to complete his four year obligation
to the Federal Government. After completion of his obligation, Respondent continued to practice in the area. For
a period of approximately two years, Respondent was the only physician in the county.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991 and 1992, Utah State licensing authorities initiated an investigation into the Respondent's prescribing
practices by conducting audits of two local pharmacies. No violations were found. However, in June 1992, after anonymous
complaints that the Respondent was receiving injections during his medical practice, the state initiated a new investigation
and determined that the Respondent was unable to account for quantities of Demerol, a Schedule II narcotic controlled
substance. Additionally, investigators determined that improper transfers of Demerol from the local hospital
to the Respondent's medical office had been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the DEA administrative hearing, Respondent testified that he had started self-administering Demerol for shoulder
pain and migraine headaches after a fall off the roof of his home. Subsequently, the Respondent was exposed to a contaminated
needle in the course of his practice, became ill, and was admitted to a hospital for several days. There, he discussed
his addiction with physicians, who arranged his admission to a five-week rehabilitative program. The Respondent
surrendered his state controlled substance license in October 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent used Demerol, without a legitimate medical purpose, and became
addicted during the summer of 1992. To obscure his use of the drug from hospital and clinic personnel, the Respondent
used Demerol from the hospital inventory, wrote false prescriptions, and, at least once, injected saline solution
into a Demerol vial. Additionally, the Respondent failed to keep complete and accurate records of his acquisition,
disposition, and inventory of controlled substances. The administrative law judge found that the Respondent's
demanding work schedule, his spouse's health problems, and a shoulder injury predisposed the Respondent to Demerol
addiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Respondent was charged, under Utah State law, with possessing and distributing a counterfeit substance, possession
of a controlled substance without a valid prescription, possession of a false prescription and failure to make a record
for prescribing and administering controlled substances. On May 3, 1993, before the Seventh Judicial District Court
for San Juan County, Utah, the Respondent pled guilty to five felony counts. The Respondent's sentence included a
fine, imprisonment not to exceed five years, and a one-year suspension of his medical license. The Court's Judgment
and Order stayed the sentence for a period of five years and the Respondent was placed on probation with conditions,
which included a two year prohibition from reapplying for a state controlled substance license. On May 5, 1993, the
State of Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issued a Stipulation and Order with terms similar
to that of the Judgment and Order, including a provision that the Respondent complete a rehabilitation program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent participated in an aftercare recovery program, attending
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; agreed to random drug screening all of which were negative; and was complying with
or working on the conditions imposed in his probation agreement and in his licensing board stipulations. The administrative
law judge concluded that the Respondent had made substantial efforts at rehabilitation, is presently in recovery,
and that his prognosis for a full recovery is good.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration may revoke the registration
of a practitioner ``*&blank;*&blank;*upon a finding that the registrant_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of
this chapter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United
States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no
longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances
or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of his registration recommended by competent State authority;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) has committed such acts as would render his registration under Section 823 of this title inconsistent with the
public interest as determined under such section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to section 1320a&hyph;7(a)
of Title 42.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge determined that subsections (2), (3), and (4) provide a basis for revocation based on
Respondent's conviction of five felony counts relating to controlled substances, his surrender of his state controlled
substance license, and the public interest factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following
factors shall be considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate.

 54 FR 16422 (1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that all of the factors listed in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) are relevant. Respondent surrendered
his state controlled substance license and the State of Utah has recommended that he not apply for reinstatement for
a period of time. Respondent admitted to wrongfully obtaining Demerol for his own use, and he pled guilty to five felony
counts relating to controlled substances. As to factor (5), the administrative law judge found that the public health
and safety are not at risk, since the Respondent has made progress in his rehabilitation and both the criminal plea
agreement and medical board agreement require that the Respondent comply with numerous conditions to ensure that
he will not suffer a relapse in his recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEA has consistently held that it does not have statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to register
a practitioner unless that practitioner is authorized by the state to dispense controlled substances. DEA has consistently
held that termination of a registrant's state authority to handle controlled substances requires that DEA revoke
the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration.

Bobby Watts, M.D.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 53 FR 11919 (1987). Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the Respondent's registration
must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a) (2), (3) and (4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional issue, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent presented evidence that the local
community has suffered by the lack of Respondent's ability to practice in the hospital emergency room. The Respondent
and the San Juan County Hospital entered into a protocol in which the Respondent would be able to write hospital patient
prescriptions for controlled substances under the hospital's DEA number. This agreement is contingent on the successful
application to the Deputy Administrator of the DEA by the hospital for a waiver of the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.76(a),
which precludes the hospital from employing an individual with access to controlled substances if that individual
has been convicted of a controlled substance related felony. The San Juan County Hospital requested that the Deputy
Administrator grant a waiver to allow the employment of the Respondent. The administrative law judge recommended
that such a waiver be granted by the Deputy Administrator pursuant to his authority under 21 CFR 1307.03.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government filed an exception to the recommendation of the administrative law judge that a waiver of 21 CFR 1301.76(a)
be granted contending that since the Respondent has no underlying state controlled substance license nor a DEA registration,
he should not be permitted to handle controlled substances under any circumstance. The Respondent, in response to
the Government exception, presented a letter from the Utah Attorney General's office permitting the Respondent,
with the appropriate DEA exemption, to order controlled substances for hospital patients, until such time as the
Utah State Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing arrived at a formal opinion on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator disagrees with the administrative law judge's recommendation with regard to a waiver or
exemption from regulations and agrees with the Government's contention that such a waiver should not be granted.
In fact, on December 7, 1993, DEA previously denied the request of San Juan Hospital that it be granted an exemption
from the regulations to allow the Respondent's employment with access to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling of Administrative
Law Judge Tenney, except as otherwise noted herein. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR
23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AW1662609, previously issued to Steven E. Warren, M.D.,
be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied.
This order is effective July 12, 1994.

I
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;44, which
authorizes operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Unit 2. The license provides, among other
things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the
Commission) now and hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBAPS, Unit 2 facility consists of a boiling water reactor located in York County, Pennsylvania.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its letter dated April 18, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the Commission's regulations. The subject
exemption is from a requirement in Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 that Type B and C containment penetration leak rate tests
be performed at intervals no greater than 2 years. The exemption would allow a one-time 60-day extension of the 2-year
requirement. Hence, this one-time exemption would allow the licensee to perform the testing in Sections III.D.2.(a)
and III.D.3 during Unit 2's Cycle 10 refueling outage scheduled to begin no later than September 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is utilizing a new core design at PBAPS, Unit 2, which allows the intervals between reactor shutdowns
for refueling to extend beyond the maximum allowable 2-year interval. Accordingly, the licensee is unable to comply
with the testing intervals specified in Appendix J of 10 CFR Part 50. Prior to the current operating cycle, local leak
rate tests were performed in conjunction with an operating cycle of 18 months. The 18-month operating cycle was more
conducive to the 2-year testing interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of extended cycle core designs has been recognized as a growing trend in the industry as discussed in the staff's
Generic Letter 91&hyph;04, ``Changes in Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month
Fuel Cycle,'' dated April 2, 1991. The staff previously granted the licensee two license amendments to allow PBAPS,
Unit 2 to perform selected surveillances on a 24-month interval (see Amendment 169 dated August 19, 1992, and Amendment
179 dated August 2, 1993). However, the regulations cited by the licensee in the exemption request have not yet been
revised to reflect the use of a 24-month operating cycle by some licensees. Therefore, the licensee has requested
an exemption in order to avoid a premature shutdown, which would be needed to accomplish the testing, and also to properly
schedule the testing during the refueling outage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type B and Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not
to exceed 2 years, is to ensure that any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified
within a time span that prevents significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow
the tests to be conducted during scheduled refueling outages. This interval was originally published in Appendix
J when refueling cycles were conducted at approximately annual intervals and has not been changed to reflect 18-month
or 2-year operating cycles. It is not the intent of the regulation to require a plant shutdown solely for the purpose
of conducting the periodic leak rate tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information presented in the licensee's application, the proposed extended test interval would not
result in a non-detectable leakage rate in excess of the value established by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, or in any changes
to the containment structure or plant systems. Therefore, the containment integrity would be maintained. As a result,
the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose
of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). Since the licensee has justified the leaktight integrity of the containment based on previous
leakage test results, the staff concludes that a one-time extension of no more than 60 days beyond the 2-year permitted
interval will not have a significant safety impact. Therefore, the staff also finds that extending the interval between
tests will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, an exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and that there are special circumstances present,
as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3
are not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose of this regulation; and hereby grants the following exemption
with respect to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit 2, the testing intervals specified in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections
III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 are extended to allow the testing to be performed during the Unit 2 cycle 10 refueling outage.
This one-time extension is granted for a maximum of 60 days from the 2 year interval required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J, Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 33312).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 831.2205(a) of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes the method for computing the reduction in
the beginning rate of annuity payable to a retiree who elects an alternative form of annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8343a. That
reduction is required in order to produce an annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the annuity of a retiree who
does not elect an alternative form of annuity. The present value factors currently used to compute the reduction were
published by OPM (56 FR 7424) on February 22, 1991.

On September 20, 1993, OPM published (58 FR 49066) a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to revise the normal cost percentage under the FERS Act of 1988, Pub. L. 99&hyph;335, based on changed economic assumptions
approved by the Board of Actuaries. Those changed economic assumptions require corresponding changes in the present
value factors used to compute an alternative form of annuity. The changed factors will also be used, in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 8334(d)(2), to compute the annuity of an employee whose annuity commences on or after October 1, 1994,
and who retires while owing a redeposit of a refund for service that ended before October 1, 1990. OPM is, therefore,
revising the table of present value factors to read as follows:

the Exchange's other index options also will be used to monitor trading in regular Index options and in full-value
and reduced-value LEAPS on the Index; and (2) advised that the REIT Index will be calculated and disseminated to the
Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') every 15 seconds by the CBOE, based on the last-sale prices of the component
stocks, and that OPRA in turn will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate,
and Quotron.

The CBOE proposes to list and trade options on the REIT Index, a new securities index developed by the CBOE and based
on REITs that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
The CBOE also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index and LEAPS on a reduced-value Index that will be computed
at one-tenth of the value of the REIT Index. REIT Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular REIT
Index options traded on the Exchange;
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated.

According to the CBOE, the REIT Index represents a segment of the U.S. equity market that is not currently represented
in the derivative markets and, as such, the CBOE concludes, should offer investors a low-cost means of achieving diversification
or to tilt their portfolios toward, or away from, real estate investments. The CBOE believes that the Index will provide
retail and institutional investors with a means of benefitting from their forecasts about the financial performance
of REITS and their underlying real estate assets. Options on the Index also may be utilized by portfolio managers and
investors to provide a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively and actively managed REITS, as well
as a means of hedging the risks of investing in real estate generally, the REIT stocks in particular.

B. Composition of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is based on securities representing 25 REIT stocks that the Exchange believes are representative of the
REIT markets. The CBOE represents that the 25 REIT stocks have invested a preponderance of their assets in real property
(typically at least 75 percent), and the property portfolios owned by these REITs constitute a diverse pool of income-earning
real estate investments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-three of the REIT stocks currently trade on the NYSE, and two trade on the Amex. All component stocks are ``reported
securities,'' as that term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices.

security or Nasdaq security for which transaction reports are required to be made on a real-time basis pursuant to
an effective transaction reporting plan.'' A ``transaction reporting plan'' is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this
rule as ``any plan for collecting, processing, making available or disseminating transaction reports with respect
to transactions in reported securities filed with the Commission pursuant to, and meeting the requirements of, this
section.''

As of the close of trading on June 10, 1994, the Index was valued at 212.55.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 As of the close of trading on February 14, 1994, the market capitalizations of the individual securities in the Index
ranged from a high of $1.1 billion (New Plan Reality) to a low of $220.2 million (Western Investment Real Estate Trust),
with a mean and median of $541.9 million and $518.7 million, respectively. The total market capitalization of the
securities in the Index was $13.5 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the REITs in the Index ranged
from a high of 49.1 million shares (New Plan Realty) to a low of 10.9 million shares (BRE Properties). The average price
per share of the securities in the Index, for the six-month period preceding February 14, 1994,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 ranged from a high of $39.90 (Weingarten Realty Investors) to a low of $6.99 (Rockefeller Center Properties). In addition,
the average daily trading volume of the REITs in the Index ranged from a high of 560,210 shares per day (Simon Property
Group)
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 to a low of 15,330 shares per day (BRE Properties), with the mean and median being 94,900 and 49,100 shares, respectively.
Lastly, no one REIT accounted for more than 6.5 percent of the Index's total value (Weingarten Realty Investors and
Nationwide Health Properties), and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for
30.2 percent of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted component was 1.1 percent of the
Index (Rockefeller Center Properties) and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues accounted for 10.2
percent of the Index's value.

C. Maintenance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index will be maintained by the CBOE. The CBOE may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance
with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect conditions in REIT markets. If it becomes necessary to
replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will make every effort to add new REITs that are representative
of REIT markets as a whole and will take into account the capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition
of the proposed replacement security. Further, securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events,
such as takeovers or mergers, that change the nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase
the number of Index component securities to greater than 33 or reduce the number of Index component securities to fewer
than 17, the CBOE will seek and obtain Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new
strike price or expiration month series of REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. In addition, in choosing replacement
securities for the Index, the CBOE will be required to ensure that at least 90 percent of the weight of the Index continues
to be comprised of REITs that are eligible for standardized options trading.

shares; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 shareholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million shares
over the preceding 12 months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days
during the preceding three calendar months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules in Chapter XXIV of the CBOE Rules will be applicable to REIT Index options and full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable position and exercise limits, policies regarding
trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based index options.

E. Calculation of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The REIT Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities relative
to the Index's base date of January 3, 1994. Specifically, the Index value is calculated by adding the prices of the
component REITs and then dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the number of components of the Index
to get the average price. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect non-market
changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition of the Index. Changes that may
result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, removal and replacement of a component REIT stock,
component stock splits, and the financial restructuring of a component stock.

The Index will be calculated continuously and will be disseminated to OPRA every 15 seconds by the CBOE, based on the
last-sale prices of the component REITs.

The proposed options on the Index will be cash-settled, European-style options.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Standard options trading hours (8:30 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. Central Standard Time) will apply to the contracts. The Index
multiplier will be 100. The strike price interval will be $5.00 for full-value Index options with a duration of one
year or less to expiration.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.9, there may be up to six expiration months outstanding at any given time. Specifically,
there may be up to three expiration months from the March, June, September, and December cycle, plus up to three additional
near-term months so that the two nearest-term months will always be available. As described in more detail below,
the Exchange also intends to list several Index LEAPS series that expire from 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance.

G. Settlement of Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration
Friday''), and the last trading day for an expiring Index option series will normally be the second to last business
day before Expiration Friday (normally a Thursday). The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular
Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale
prices for each of the Index's component securities in their primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Expiration Friday). Once all of the component REITs have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that
value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts. If any of the component REITs
do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior trading day's (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 normally a Thursday) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use Thursday's
closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the CBOE will
wait until the end of the trading day on Expiration Friday.

H. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value REIT Index 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange's proposal provides that the Exchange may list LEAPS that expire from 12 to 36 months from the listing
based on the full-value REIT Index or a reduced-value REIT Index that will be computed at one-tenth the value of the
full-value Index, subject to existing Exchange requirements applicable to full-value and reduced-value LEAPS.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The current and closing Index value for reduced-value REIT Index LEAPS will be computed by dividing the value of the
full-value Index by ten and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, an Index value
of 212.55 would be 21.26 for the reduced-value Index LEAPS, and 212.54 would become 21.25. The reduced-value Index
LEAPS will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all of the
Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures.
Pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.9, the strike price interval for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50,
instead of $5.00.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Index is classified as an ``industry index'' under CBOE rules,
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on narrow-based indexes will apply to the trading of REIT
Index options and LEAPS. Specifically, Exchange rules governing margin requirements,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 position and exercise limits,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 and trading halt procedures
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 that are applicable to the trading of narrow-based index options will apply to options traded on the Index. For purposes
of determining whether a given position in reduced-value Index LEAPS complies with applicable position and exercise
limits, positions in reduced-value Index LEAPS will be aggregated with positions in the full-value Index options.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 For these purposes, ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract.

III. Commission Findings and Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of REIT Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
REIT Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities
market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with REIT securities.

Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding
that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult
for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be
derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public
confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed
index options and full-value index LEAPS on the REIT Index will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should
reflect the overall movement of REIT securities in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also believes that
these Index options will provide investors with a means by which to make investment decisions in the REIT sector of
the U.S. securities markets, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in such markets
in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, the Commission believes that the reduced-value Index LEAPS, which will be
traded on an index computed at one-tenth the value of the REIT index, will serve the needs of retail investors by providing
them with the opportunity to use a long-term option to hedge their portfolios from long-term market moves at a reduced
cost.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the trading of options on the REIT Index, including full-value and reduced-value LEAPS on the Index, raises
several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact.
The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE has adequately addressed these concerns.

A. Index Design and Structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the REIT Index is a narrow-based index. The REIT Index is composed of only 25 securities,
all of which are REIT stocks.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the CBOE to apply its rules governing narrow-based
index options to trading in the Index options.

The reduced-value REIT Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index, is identical to the
REIT Index, except that it is calculated by dividing the Index value by ten.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the majority of
the components that comprise the Index are actively-traded, with a mean and median average daily trading volume of
94,900 and 49,100 shares, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $1.1 billion
to a low of $220.2 million, as of February 14, 1994, with the mean and median being $541.9 million and $518.7 million,
respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of 25 component securities, no one particular security
or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no individual REIT stock comprises more than 6.5 percent
of the Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 30.2 percent
of the Index's value.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Fourth all of the securities in the Index are eligible for standardized options trading (four of which currently underlie
exchange-listed options).
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed CBOE maintenance requirement that at least 90 percent of the weighting of the Index be comprised of securities
that are eligible for options trading will ensure that the Index is always substantially comprised of options eligible
securities. Fifth, if the CBOE increases the number of component securities to more than 33 or decreases that number
to less than 17, the CBOE will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before
listing new strike price or expiration month series of REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against
material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the CBOE's obligations to
protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the CBOE will
be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting requirements in the United
States. This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission
believes that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the REIT Index in any significant way through trading
in component REITs, coupled with existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, as discussed
below, will help deter such illegal activity.

In addition, for the six month period prior to February 14, 1994, no component of the Index had an average daily trading
volume of less than 15,300 shares per day.

For an index with a significantly greater number of securities than 25 issues, the Commission might come to a different
conclusion if only a few securities accounted for a significant portion of the index's weighting. Further, if an index
contained only a few stocks, the Commission might question whether it could be traded as an index product.

B. Customer Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as REIT Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized,
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) the special
risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks
of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts.
Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized
options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the
protection of investors in REIT Index options and full-value and reduced-value REIT Index LEAPS.

C. Surveillance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index
derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the NYSE and the Amex, which currently are the primary markets for the REITs comprising the Index, are
both members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information.

D. Market Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of options on the REIT Index, including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 First, as described above, for the most part no one security or group of securities dominates the Index. Second, because
at least 90 percent of the numerical value of the Index must be accounted for by securities that meet the Exchange's
options listing standards, the component securities generally will be actively-traded, highly-capitalized securities.
Third, the 10,500 contract position and exercise limits applicable to Index options and Index LEAPS will serve to
minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Fourth, the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance
will be minimized because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be issued and guaranteed by The Options Clearing Corporation
just like any other standardized option traded in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the CBOE has represented that the CBOE and OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support those new
series of index options that would result from the introduction of options and LEAPS on the REIT Index. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring REIT Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is consistent with the Act. As noted in other contexts,
valuing options for exercise settlement on expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices may help
reduce adverse effects on markets for securities underlying options on the Index.

E. Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies the proposed rule change by making specific representations with respect to surveillance
and Index value dissemination. These representations are identical in all material respects to those made by the
Exchange in connection with similar proposals to list options on stock indexes.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 1. Accordingly, the Commission
believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's
proposal on an accelerated basis.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that the proposed rule change would increase the efficiency of both the implementation and operation
of Board rules involving the submission of information to the Board. The ``procedures'' contemplated by the proposed
rule change would concern only matters of a technical nature. The proposed rule change further provides that any procedures,
or amendment thereto, may be approved by the Board without the necessity of a formal Board meeting, pursuant to existing
rule A&hyph;4(d). Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides a mechanism by which action, ``other than action on proposed rules or
proposed amendment to rules of the Board,'' may be taken by written consent of the Board or by telephone poll of all Board
members.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, the Board will continue to file any matters with the Commission, as required, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
of the Act, and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.

Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides that: Action by the Board, other than action on proposed rules or proposed amendments to
rules of the Board, may be taken without a meeting by written consent of the Board setting forth the action so taken or
by telephone poll of all members of the Board, provided that, in the case of action taken by telephone, the Board, at
a meeting, or the Chairman of the Board authorizes the action to be taken by such means. The Executive Director shall
transmit to each Board member, as soon as practicable after a telephone poll is taken, a written statement setting
forth the questions or questions with respect to which the telephone poll was taken and the results of the telephone
poll. Such statements shall also be entered in the minutes of the next Board meeting. In the case of action taken without
a meeting by written consent or telephone poll, an affirmative vote of a majority of the whole Board is required.

The Commission notes that the present proposal is intended to expedite Board consideration of matters that are technical
in nature, and is not intended to affect the types of proposals that the Board files with the Commission pursuant to
Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19(b)(4) thereunder. Telephone conversation,

On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37, concerning political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 This rule, among other things, requires dealers to submit certain information ``to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in
accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly with due dates determined by the Board. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In its filing with the Commission, the Board noted that it ``is in the process of developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37
filing procedures to allow for public access to the information to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37, as well as indexing,
record storage, etc. *&blank;*&blank;*''
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In the present filing, the Board discussed these rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures as an example of the types of procedures
to which the instant proposed rule change would apply. The Board will submit to the Commission another proposed rule
change relating to rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures.

approval of File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;04). In addition, in order to assist dealer compliance with the
filing requirements of rule G&hyph;37, the Board intends to develop an informal ``Procedures Manual'' for the relevant
forms and procedures, and periodically to update or to amend the manual. The manual also would include forms and other
filing information regarding rule G&hyph;36 on delivery of official statements and advance refunding documents
to the Board. In the future, the Board also may adopt procedures regarding technical matters relating to the Board's
Continuing Disclosure Information system, as well as any transaction reporting system the Board may develop.

 notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') filed with the Securities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSRB has filed an interpretation regarding Rule G&hyph;15(a). The new interpretation of the rule allows dealers
under certain circumstances to satisfy the Rule G&hyph;15(a)'s requirement that municipal securities customers
be provided a ``written'' confirmation by using the Thomson Financial Services, Inc. (``TFS'') OASYS Global System.

In its filing with the Commission, MSRB included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The texts of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV, below. MSRB has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSRB's rule change allows the requirement of Rule G&hyph;15(a), that customers be provided ``written'' confirmation
at or before the completion of a transaction in municipal securities, to be satisfied by a contract confirmation message
(``CCM'') sent through the TFS OASYS Global System. The following conditions must be met before the OASYS Global System
may be used: (i) The customer and dealer have both agreed to use the OASYS Global system for purposes of confirmation
delivery; (ii) the CCM includes all information required by Rule G&hyph;15(a); and (iii) all other applicable requirements
and conditions concerning the OASYS Global system expressed in the Commission's October 8, 1993, no-action letter
concerning Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b&hyph;10 must continue to be met.

The no-action letter of October 8, 1993, stated that the Commission staff will not recommend enforcement action to
the Commission if broker-dealers rely on the OASYS Global system's CCMs to satisfy the requirements of a confirmation
of Rule 10b&hyph;10 of the Act provided (i) The CCMs can be printed or downloaded by the participants, (ii) the recipient
of a CCM must respond through the system affirming or rejecting the trade, (iii), the CCMs will not be automatically
deleted by the system, and (iv) the use of the system by the participants ensures that both parties to the transaction
have the capacity to receive the CCMs. Letter from Catherine McGuire, Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation,
SEC, to MariAnne Pisarri, Esq., Pickard and Djinis (October 8, 1993).

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSRB understands that TFS's OASYS Global system is not a registered securities clearing agency and is not linked with
other registered securities clearing agencies for purposes of automated confirmation/acknowledgment required
under Rule G&hyph;15(d). Therefore, under these circumstances, use of the OASYS system will not constitute compliance
with Rule G&hyph;15(d) regarding automated confirmation/acknowledgement.

MSRB Rule 15(d)(ii) states, among other things, that no broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer who is or whose
clearing agent is a participant in a clearing agency registered with the Commission shall effect a transaction in
any municipal security to which a CUSIP number has been assigned on a delivery-versus-payment basis or on a receipt-versus-payment
basis for the account of a customer whose clearing agent with respect to such transfer is a participant in such a clearing
agency or in a clearing agency interfaced or otherwise linked with such a clearing agency unless the facilities of
such clearing agency or the facilities of a clearing agency interfaced or otherwise linked with such a clearing agency
are used for the confirmation and acknowledgment of such transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

MSRB does not believe that the rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers.
Moreover, the rule change only applies when dealers and customers agree between themselves to use TFS's OASYS Global
system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSRB has not solicited or received comments on the proposed rule change. MSRB's consideration of the proposed rule
change was prompted by an interpretive inquiry from TFS regarding the interpretation of Rule G&hyph;15(a).

The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(1)
of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder because it relates to the interpretation of the meaning of an existing rule. At any time
within sixty days of filing of the rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears
to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors,
or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on June 17, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;10)

The proposed rule change was originally filed on October 27, 1989 and was approved temporarily through December 31,
1990. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27664 (January 31, 1990), 55 FR 4297 (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;89&hyph;16).
Subsequently, the Commission granted a number of extensions to the temporary approval to allow the Commission and
NSCC sufficient time to review and assess the use of letters of credit as clearing fund collateral. Most recently temporary
approval was granted until June 30, 1994. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32551 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36727 (File

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NSCC is seeking permanent approval of a proposed rule change that modifies the amount of a member's required clearing
fund deposit that may be collateralized by letters of credit. Specifically, the proposed rule change increases the
minimum cash contribution for those members who use letters of credit from $50,000 to the greater of $50,000 or 10%
of their required clearing fund deposit up to a maximum of $1,000,000. In addition, the rule change provides that only
70% of a member's required clearing fund deposit may be collateralized with letters of credit. The rule change also
adds headings to the clearing fund formula section for purposes of clarity and includes other nonsubstantive drafting
changes. The effect of the proposed rule change is to increase the liquidity of the clearing fund and to limit NSCC's
exposure to unusual risks resulting from the reliance on letters of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since obtaining temporary approval of the original filing, NSCC has filed clearing fund composition reports with
the Commission. NSCC states that since December 31, 1989, as a result of the new requirements, it has observed the following
changes in the composition of the clearing fund:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Cash deposits have increased by approximately 225%;

In October of 1989 when the Commission initially granted temporary approval of NSCC's proposal, letters of credit
accounted for 76% of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits. By May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted
for less than 30%. During the period from June 1, 1992 to May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for an average of 30.49%
of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits, and for no month during that period did the portion of
letters of credit used for required clearing fund deposits rise above 34%. Letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Vice President/Director
of Legal &amp; Associate General Counsel, NSCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (June

Morgan Securities, Inc. opposed the NSCC's proposal because they believe it would increase the cost of posting collateral.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that a clearing agency's rules be designed, among other things, to ensure
the safeguarding of securities and funds in its possession or control or for which it is responsible and to protect
investors and the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 NSCC's proposal to limit the use of letters of credit to collateralize clearing fund obligations will make NSCC's
clearing fund more liquid. A liquid clearing fund is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of a clearing agency.
NSCC's proposal is therefore consistent with the requirements under the Act with regard to NSCC's obligation to safeguard
securities and funds and to protect the interests of investors and of the public.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although letters of credit are a useful means of funding clearing agency guarantee deposits, their unrestricted
use may present risks to clearing agencies. Because letters of credit reflect the issuer's promise to pay funds upon
presentation of stipulated documents by the holder, a clearing agency holding letters of credit will be exposed to
risk should the issuer refuse to honor its promise to pay. Furthermore, because under the Uniform Commercial Code
the issuer may defer honoring a payment request until the close of business on the third banking day following receipt
of the required documents, the clearing agency either may have to await payment or may have to seek alternative short-term
financing. This waiting period could reduce a clearing agency's liquidity and thereby could hinder its ability to
meet its payment obligations on a timely basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, since the proposal first received temporary approval, NSCC has experienced over a 200% increase
in the deposit of cash and securities deposited as clearing fund collateral. Because cash and securities are generally
more liquid than letters of credit, the enhanced level of such deposits helps to ensure the liquidity of the clearing
fund in the event of a major member insolvency, catastrophic loss, or major settlement loss. By reducing the risk associated
with the use of letters of credit, the proposal is consistent with NSCC's responsibilities under the Act to safeguard
securities or funds in its custody or control and to protect investors and the public in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because
accelerated approval of the proposal will keep effective NSCC's rules that help reduce the exposure of NSCC's clearing
fund to the potential liquidity risks associated with using letters of credit to collateralize members' clearing
fund obligations. Moreover, since it was first introduced in 1989, NSCC's proposal has been open for public comment
and has elicited only one opposing comment. Thus the Commission does not foresee that approval of the proposal will
elicit further opposition.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 7, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD is submitting this filing to effectuate The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.'s (``Nasdaq'') periodic reclassification
of Nasdaq National Market (``NNM'') securities into appropriate tier sizes for purposes of the maximum order size
tiers for Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') and the minimum quote size requirements for Nasdaq market
makers in NNM securities. Since the NASD's proposal is an interpretation of existing NASD rules, there are no language
changes.

The purpose of the rule change is to effectuate Nasdaq's periodic reclassification of NNM securities into appropriate
tier sizes for purposes of the maximum order size tiers for SOES and the minimum quote size requirements for Nasdaq
market makers in NNM securities. Nasdaq reviews the tier level applicable to each security periodically (approximately
every six months) to determine if the trading characteristics of the issue have changed so as to warrant a tier level
adjustment. Such a review was conducted as of February 28, 1994, using the following established criteria:

size for SOES is now 500 shares, Nasdaq has continued to classify NNM securities within the 1,000 share tier size because
Nasdaq market makers must continue to display a size of 1,000 shares in their quotations for these securities, and
remain firm for a minimum of 1,000 shares at their publicized quotations in these securities for orders outside of
SOES.

Pursuant to the application of this classification criteria, 500 NNM securities will be reclassified effective
July 11, 1994. These 500 NNM securities are set out in the NASD's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice To Members 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
94&hyph;48 (June 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In ranking NNM securities pursuant to the established classification criteria, Nasdaq followed the changes dictated
by the criteria with two exceptions. First, an issue was not moved more than one tier size level. For example, if an issue
was previously categorized in the 1,000-share tier size, it would not be permitted to move to the 200-share tier even
if the reclassification criteria showed that such a move was warranted. In adopting this policy, Nasdaq was attempting
to maintain adequate public investor access to the market for issues in which the tier size level decreased and minimize
market maker exposure in issues for which the tier size level increased. Second, for eight securities priced below
$1 where the reclassification called for a reduction in tier size, Nasdaq determined not to recommend a decline in
tier size given the low price of these securities and the negligible effect on market maker exposure. As a result, five
securities that would have been reduced to a tier size of 200 shares from 500 shares remained at 500 shares and three
securities that would have been reduced to a tier size of 500 shares from 1,000 shares remained at 1,000 shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. Section
15A(b)(11) applies to the form and content of quotations. Section 15A(b)(11) requires that rules relating to quotations
must be fair and informative so as to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations.
The NASD believes that the reassignment of NNM securities within SOES tier size levels and minimum quotation size
levels will further these ends by providing an efficient mechanism for small, retail investors to execute their orders
on Nasdaq and providing investors with the assurance that they can effect trades up to a certain size at the quotations
displayed on Nasdaq.

The proposed rule change has become effective immediately pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b&hyph;4 because the reranking of NNM securities into appropriate order size
tiers and quotation size requirements was done pursuant to the NASD's stated policy and practice with respect to the
administration and enforcement of two existing NASD rules. Further, in the SOES Tier Size Order,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission requested that the NASD provide this information as an interpretation of an existing NASD rule under
section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission
may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 24, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE is proposing to amend its fine schedule for violations of Equity Floor Procedure Advice 2&hyph;B, relating
to the dissemination of quotations in local issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``EFPA'') 2&hyph;B of the Rules of the Pacific Stock Exchange is designed to enforce
the requirement that PSE specialists disseminate quotations in their assigned local issues every day. Specifically,
the specialist must disseminate a quote prior to one-half (1/2) hour after the PSE opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to enforce this requirement, EFPA 2&hyph;B has a schedule that requires that all specialists be monitored
daily on a rotating quarterly basis. Failure to satisfy the requirement currently results in a $25 fine for each violation
beginning with the sixth violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, the PSE is proposing to amend this rule to provide that the fine be changed to $100 with an implementation
upon the third violation. It is the position of the Exchange that this will provide an effective deterrent and reflect
a more appropriate penalty for non-compliance with EFPA 2&hyph;B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, is general, and Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6),
in particular, in that it is designed to protect investors and the public interest, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to assure that Exchange members are appropriately disciplined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on April 21, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The filing requested:
(1) Permanent approval of the After-Hours Trading (``AHT'') Facility; and (2) approval on a pilot basis for specialists
in investment trust securities based on stock indexes to participate in the AHT Facility. The Commission approved
the portion of the filing that requested permanent approval of the AHT Facility in Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 33993.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 On August 3, 1993, the Exchange amended the filing to request that specialists in Portfolio Depository Receipts (``PDRs'')
also be permitted to participate in the AHT Facility.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 On July 5, 1994, the Exchange amended the proposed rule change to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and
investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT Facility.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on specialist participation
in the AHT Facility in Portfolio Depository Receipts and investment trust securities based on Stock Indexes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Exchange proposes to permit specialists in Portfolio Depositary Receipts and investment trust securities to

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange requests Commission approval for specialists in Portfolio Depositary Receipts (``PDRs'') and investment
trust securities listed pursuant to Section 118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 to participate in the AHT facility to ``clean-up'' order imbalances in the AHT facility by entering an order for the
specialist's account. For example, if there were single sided orders to buy 10,000 and sell 20,000 SPDRs immediately
prior to the 5:00 p.m. close of the AHT facility, the specialist would be permitted under the Exchange's proposed rule
amendments to enter an order for its account to buy up to 10,000 SPDRs in order to eliminate the sell side order imbalance.

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange currently lists one Portfolio Depositary Receipt, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
viz
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
., Standard and Poor's Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs''); and two investment trust securities pursuant to Section
118B of the Exchange's Listing Guidelines: LOR Index Trust SuperUnits and LOR Money Market SuperUnits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange also seeks Commission approval for specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate
in a coupled closing price order so long as the other side of the order is not for an account in which a member or member
organization has a direct or indirect interest. For example, under the Exchange's proposal, the specialist in SPDRs
would be permitted to agree prior to the 4:15 close of the regular trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 session for such securities to take the other side of a customer order to buy or sell SPDRs for execution in the AHT facility
as a closing price coupled order. Such a capability would conform the trading of PDRs and investment trust securities
to the practices of the ``basket'' market for equities where it is customary for a dealer to agree prior to the close
of the regular trading session to take the contra side of a customer basket order and the closing index value. Specialists
on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') currently are permitted to take the contra side of a customer order
to buy or sell a particular equity security and enter such order into the NYSE's Off-Hours Trading facility as a closing
price coupled order. The Exchange seeks a similar capability for specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities
to conform the trading of these listed instruments to the practices of the basket market.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in the
AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing price coupled orders would benefit investors
by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative securities based upon well known market
indexes, such as those described above. The market price of these securities is based upon transactions largely effected
in markets other than the Amex. The specialist in such securities has no unique access to market sensitive information
regarding the market for the underlying securities or closing index values. The Exchange, therefore, believes that
specialist participation in the AHT facility in PDRs and investment trust securities in the manner described above
does not raise any market integrity issues. In addition, should a customer not care for an execution at the closing
price, the rules of the Exchange's AHT facility permit cancellation of an order up to the close of the AHT session at
5:00 p.m. (orders in the AHT facility are not executed until the 5:00 p.m. close of the after-hours session.) A customer,
therefore, will have approximately 40 minutes to determine if an execution at the closing price suits its needs, and
may cancel its order if it believes that the closing price does not suit its objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange also proposes to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from
the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility to eliminate any concern with the handling of such orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange proposes that the Commission approve the Exchange's application to permit specialist participation
in the AHT facility for PDRs and investment trust securities on a pilot basis, during which time the Exchange will study
the operation of the facility to determine if there are any additional issues that need to be addressed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just
and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange's Plan provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $2,500, on any member, member organization,

violation of certain specified Exchange rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The BSE's Plan for enforcing and reporting minor disciplinary rule violations was approved by the Commission in Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438&hyph;I (April 24, 1989) (File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;88&hyph;2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Plan is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a sanction is appropriate but when initiation
of a full disciplinary proceeding is not suitable because such proceeding would be more costly and onerous than would
be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. The Plan provides for an appropriate response to minor violations
of certain Exchange rules while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Exchange's initial filing which set forth the provisions and procedures of the Plan, the Exchange indicated
that it periodically would amend the list of rules subject to the Plan as the Exchange deemed appropriate. The Exchange
now seeks to add the aforementioned rules and policy to the List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(6) of the Act, in that its members and persons associated
with its members will be appropriately disciplined for violation of rules and policies where the Exchange has determined
that such violation is minor in nature. In accordance with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act, the Plan provides
for a fair disciplinary procedure for the imposition of sanctions.

The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to list and trade options on the Semiconductor Index (``Index''),

The current price of each component issue is multiplied by 100 shares. The resulting market values are added to determine
the current aggregate market value of the issues in the Index. To compute the current Index value, the aggregate market
value is divided by the base divisor. The value of the Index was set to equal 200 on December 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjustments in the value of the Index which are necessitated by the addition and/or deletion of an issue from the Index
are made by adding and/or subtracting the market value (current stock price &times; 100 shares) of the relevant issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Index value will be updated dynamically at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day. The Phlx has retained
Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index values will be disseminated
and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association and over the facilities
of the Options Price Reporting Authority. The Index value will also be available on broker/dealer interrogation
devices to subscribers of the option information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Phlx Rule 1009A, if any change in the nature of any stock in the Index occurs as a result of delisting,
merger, acquisition or otherwise, the Exchange will take appropriate steps to delete this stock from the Index and
replace it with another stock which the Exchange believes would be compatible with the intended market character
of the Index. In making replacement determinations, the Exchange will also take into account the capitalization,
liquidity, and volatility of a particular stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Index options will be traded pursuant to the current Phlx rules governing the trading of index options, particularly
Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, and generally, Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The settlement value for Index options will be based on the opening values of the component securities on the date prior
to expiration. Index options will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month, and the
last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Phlx proposes to employ position and exercise limits pursuant to Phlx Rule 1001A(b) (i) and 1002A, respectively.
Exercise price intervals will be initially set at 5 point intervals and additional exercise prices will be added in
accordance with Phlx Rule 1101A(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Phlx will trade consecutive and cycle month series pursuant to Phlx Rule 1101A. Specifically, there will be three
expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months so that the
three nearest term months will always be available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5),

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements governing the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to make certain structural and technical changes to Chapter XV (``Dealer-Specialists'').
Primarily, the Exchange seeks to provide paragraph numbering for ease of reference. In addition, the Exchange seeks
to remove outdated and repetitive language, such as reference to the Business Conduct Committee which is now the Market
Performance Committee. Certain paragraphs have been relocated to sections which are more applicable, and clarifying
language has been added to certain sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is section 6(b)(5) in that the rule is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed
to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to amend pending new Rule 1069
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to provide for the ability to: (1) Trade European-term option contracts on any foreign currency on which the Phlx currently
trades foreign currency options (``FCOs''); (2) trade cross-rate FCOs on any two such approved currencies; and (3)
allow users to quote all customized FCOs in percentage terms. Proposed Rule 1069, as well as existing Rules 1000, 1009,
1014, 1033, and 1034, would be amended accordingly. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office
of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 4, 1994, the Phlx filed with the Commission a proposal (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 to allow FCO traders and their customers to have the ability, within specified limits, to designate their own option
exercise price parameters on a trade. In that filing, the Exchange proposed to allow its users to dictate the specific
strike price of an FCO contract that they would like to buy or sell without requiring the Exchange to continuously disseminate
quotes for these options. For example, if the Exchange has listed June .5450 and .5500 Deutsche mark calls and the customer
wants to trade June .5487 Deutsche mark calls, the customer could request a quote in this option and the trade could
occur. The Exchange, however, would not have to continuously disseminate quotes for this option until expiration
because this may be the only trade that ever occurs in this series.

The Exchange is now proposing to expand upon its proposed FCO customization contained in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11.
If File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 as well as the present proposal are approved, the Exchange would be able
to offer the ability for its participants to trade non-standardized strike prices on existing series of FCOs as well
as ``inverse'' or European-term contracts on those currencies presently listed on the Exchange, and cross-rate
contracts on any two of the existing eight currencies on which the Exchange presently lists FCOs (i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the British pound, Swiss franc, French franc, Deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar,
and European Currency Unit).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
European-Term FCOs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first addition to the array of previously proposed customized FCOs that the Exchange now proposes to offer is the
European-term contract. The Exchange presently lists options on eight foreign currencies. Each of these FCO contracts
is structured so that the trading currency is the U.S. dollar (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 French franc/U.S. dollar). The option is quoted in U.S. dollars per unit of the relevant foreign currency and the premium
is paid in U.S. dollars. Upon exercise of a call option, for example, the relevant foreign currency would be delivered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The European-term customized FCO contract would be the inverse of the FCO contracts just described (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 U.S. dollar/French franc). The option will be quoted in units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar and the premium
will be paid in the foreign currency. Because the underlying currency is the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollars will be delivered
upon exercise of a call option. The title of proposed Rule 1069
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 will be changed to ``Customized Options'' to reflect the fact that users will be able to customize FCO contracts in
more aspects than merely the strike price. Exchange Rule 1000(13), which provides the definition of ``foreign currency,''
will also be amended to include the U.S. dollar so that U.S. dollars may be considered an underlying foreign currency
under all applicable Exchange rules. Similarly, Rule 1009, which lists all of the approved underlying foreign currencies
would also be amended, as well as the definitions of ``spot sales price'' and ``forward sales price'' in Rules 1000(16)
and 1000(17).

Cross-Rate FCOs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The second proposed addition to the customized FCO facility proposed in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11
would allow the Exchange to offer the ability to trade any cross-rate FCO contract on any two foreign currencies approved
for trading on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 1009.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For example, an option on the Swiss franc/Canadian dollar could be traded. The Exchange believes, however, that it
would be inefficient to disseminate updated quotes on all of the possible combinations of cross-rate FCOs that could
be created by all of the listed currencies now available. The Exchange believes that most will not be of wide spread
interest but may appeal to only a limited number of customers or be active for only brief periods of time due to unpredictable
political or economic events in the U.S. and abroad.

Alternative Order Formats
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Exchange proposes to offer the ability to request quotes and receive quotes in terms of a percentage of
the underlying currency in addition to the present unit of currency format (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, cents per unit of the underlying currency). Percentage quoting would be offered on all FCOs available through the
proposed customized FCO facility. The Exchange represents that many users of FCOs have requested this quotation
method and the Exchange believes it is appropriate to offer it in this limited fashion through the proposed customized
FCO facility. Unit of currency quotations will also still be available for the proposed customized FCOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market has traditionally given its users the ability to
customize FCO contracts by allowing them to designate many if not all of the terms of the FCO contracts. The participants
in the OTC market, according to the Exchange, are typically institutional investors, corporations, and banks, who
buy and sell FCOs in large size transactions in order to hedge risks relating to fluctuating exchange rates. By trading
in the OTC market, these users do not benefit from the advantages offered by an organized exchange, such as, transparency,
margin and collateral, and secondary market liquidity. The Exchange is now proposing to give these users the flexibility
of the OTC market by allowing them to trade and quote FCO contracts tailored to their specifications but within the
confines of an exchange environment. By having the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') as the issuer and guarantor
of the customized FCOs, it will eliminate concern over contra-party creditworthiness and assure performance upon
exercise of the customized FCOs. Finally, the Exchange believes that transparency will be achieved by the real time
dissemination of the quotes, requests for quotes, and last sale information through the Options Price Reporting
Authority (``OPRA'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability of Existing Exchange Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
European-term and cross-rate customized FCOs would be subject to all Exchange rules and regulations regarding surveillance
and sales practice. Unless specifically exempted, all floor trading procedures will also be adhered to. Examples
of different procedures for the proposed European-term and cross-rate customized FCOs include no continuous quoting,
no opening or closing rotations, size restrictions as to exercise, new minimum fractional changes, and new maximum
quote spread parameters. Position and exercise limits for European-term customized FCOs would be the same as those
applicable to FCOs on the same foreign currency and positions in these options will be aggregated with existing FCOs
in calculating position and exercise limits. For example, U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark FCOs will be aggregated with
Deutsche mark/U.S. dollar FCO positions. The Exchange will establish separate position limits for the cross-rate
customized FCOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum quote and transaction sizes that the Exchange proposed in File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;11 for
customized strike FCOs will also apply to customized European-term and cross-rate FCOs.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, quotes may not be requested and trades may not be executed in a series with no open interest for less than
300 contracts. Responsive quotes for series with no open interest must be at least 300 contracts for assigned ROTs
and 100 contracts for non-assigned ROTs. Responsive quotes and transactions in currently opened series may be the
lesser of 100 contracts or the remaining number of contracts for all participants.

Financial Responsibility

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Exchange will impose higher net capital requirements for ROTs trading in customized FCOs. Assigned ROTs will
be subject to a $1 million minimum net liquid assets requirement and all other ROTs will be subject to a $250,000 minimum
net liquid assets requirement. European-term customized FCOs will be margined in the same fashion as existing FCO
contracts. The Exchange proposes to allow spread margin treatment for European-term contracts offset against corresponding
standardized contracts in instances in which the long notional value of either the European-term or standardized
contract equals or exceeds the short national value of the other side.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cross-rate customized FCOs will be margined using a three tier system. The Exchange will look at the correlation coefficients
between any two currency combinations for each of the 28 possible (non-U.S. dollar) cross-rates in order to determine
whether the two currencies have high, low, or negative correlations. Margin levels will be set by using a tier system
based upon the degree of correlation between the different currencies. Historically, for example, the Exchange
states that there has been a very high correlation between the French franc, Swiss franc, Deutsche mark, and the European
Currency Unit (Tier I). Thus, the margin levels necessary for a cross-rate based on any two of these currencies should,
the Exchange believes, be low. The correlations between any Tier I currency and either the British pound or the Japanese
yen (Tier II) are, according to the Exchange, slightly lower and would, therefore, require higher margin levels.
Finally, the Exchange states that the correlations between any of the currencies in Tiers I or II and either the Canadian
dollar or the Australian dollar (Tier III) are extremely low or negative, thereby requiring a higher margin level
than the other two. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to establish margin levels of 2% for cross-rate FCOs based
upon any two currencies within Tier 1; 4% for cross-rate FCOs based on one Tier I currency and one Tier II currency or
two Tier II currencies; and 6% for FCOs based on one Tier III currency and one Tier I or Tier II currency or two Tier III
currencies. After the cross-rate customized FCOs are trading, the Exchange will review the correlations quarterly
to see if any of the currencies are eligible for placement in another tier based upon the correlation over the prior
quarter.

When a request for a customized FCO quote is voiced in the trading crowd, it will be displayed and all responsive quotes
will also be displayed. Once a trade is consummated, it will be reported to OPRA and disseminated as an administrative
text message over the OPRA system. The Exchange will not be obligated to make continuous markets in customized FCOs,
even where open interest has been created. OCC will clear and settle the customized FCOs. Because quotes in these options
will not be continuously updated or otherwise priced by the Exchange, OCC will generate a theoretical price based
on the prices and quotes of the customized FCOs, prices of standardized series and the closing value of the underlying
foreign currency. OCC will use this price to mark the FCOs daily and calculate margin requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this rule filing is proposing to change language in Rules 1009 and 1033, the Exchange is also proposing to correct
some inaccurate or redundant information contained in those rules. First, the Exchange believes that Commentary
.01(6) of Rule 1009 is almost identical to subsection (c) of that rule and is therefore proposed to be deleted. Secondly,
the contract size of the British pound and the French franc, as approved by the Commission, are 31,250 pounds
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and 250,000 francs,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 not 12,500 pounds and 125,000 francs as currently stated in Phlx's rules. These sizes and corresponding examples
of how to calculate the premium on these FCOs are being corrected in Rule 1033.

The Exchange believes that the foregoing rule change proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general,
and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information,
and facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest by providing foreign currency
option market participants with strike prices more closely suited to their trading strategies.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On October
12, 1984, applicant registered under the Act and filed a registration statement pursuant to section 8(b) of the Act.
The registration statement became effective on December 21, 1984, and the initial public offering commenced on January
25, 1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. At a Special Meeting held on December 2, 1993, the board of trustees of applicant voted to approve an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization (the ``Plan'') and called a Special Meeting of the shareholders of applicant to vote on the
Plan. Pursuant to the Plan, the assets of applicant were transferred to Dean Witter Value-Added Market Series, a Massachusetts
business trust (``Value-Added'') in exchange for shares of Value-Added (the ``Reorganization'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In approving the Reorganization, the directors considered a number of factors, including, (a) the comparative
investment performance and past growth in assets of applicant and Value-Added, (b) the comparative expenses of applicant
and Value-Added, (c) the impact on applicant's security holders if applicant were not reorganized or were liquidated,
(d) the compatibility of the investment objectives, policies, restrictions, and portfolios of applicant and Value-Added,
(e) the terms and conditions of the Reorganization that would affect the price of Value-Added shares to be issued in
the Reorganization, (f) the tax-free nature of the Reorganization, and (g) any direct or indirect costs to be incurred
by applicant and Value-Added in connection with the Reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicant and Value-Added could be deemed affiliated persons of each other within the meaning of the Act. In accordance
with rule 17a&hyph;8, the board of trustees of applicant determined that the sale of applicant's assets to Value-Added
was in the best interests of applicant and applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders
would not be diluted as a result of applicant effecting the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Preliminary proxy materials were filed on December 3, 1993, as part of Value-Added's registration statement on
Form N&hyph;14. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Reorganization were filed on February 25, 1993. Applicant's
shareholders voted to approve the Plan on April 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As of April 15, 1994, applicant had 12,702,132.755 shares outstanding, at a net asset value of $8.38 per share and
an aggregate net asset value of $106,440,011.49. Pursuant to the Plan, the assets of applicant were transferred to
Value-Added in exchange for shares of beneficial interest of Value-Added. The aggregate net asset value of shares
of Value-Added issued in the Reorganization was equal to the value of applicant's assets on April 15, 1994 (the business
day immediately preceding the Reorganization) less applicant's liabilities. Applicant thereafter distributed
the Value-Added shares it received to its security holders by crediting each security holder with a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
portion of Value-Added shares equal to the security holder's investment in applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the Reorganization. The cost of printing and mailing the
proxy statement and any additional material relating to the stockholder meeting at which the Plan and the Reorganization
were approved, and the cost of soliciting proxies, including legal and accounting fees in connection with the preparation
of the proxy statement, was paid by applicant. Any expenses related to the shareholders of Value-Added, in connection
with the Reorganization, were paid by Value-Added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. At the time of the application, applicant had no security holders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not now engaged in, and does not propose to engage in,
any business activities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will prepare an environmental
impact statement for the Global TransPark and Section 404 Permit application. The EIS will investigate the expansion
of the existing Kinston Regional Jetport to accommodate the GTP. The proposed improvements consist of providing
for the construction and operation of a new 11,500-foot runway, together with related taxiways, and other related
facilities, along with land acquisition and land use planning. The proposed project also includes other primary
infrastructure, such as roadway improvements, areas for industrial development and a central cargo facility to
move products in and out of the complex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS is anticipated to address impacts on wetlands, historic properties, and so forth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will also evaluate cumulative impacts anticipated to occur as a result of the implementation of other foreseeable
improvements at the GTP in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Carolina Global TransPark Authority (Authority) issued a Request For Proposals inviting local governments
and other public and/or private groups interested in being the site for GTP to present written proposals of their qualifications
of the site and surrounding area. The RFP requested that the proponent furnish information on environmental factors
as well as services, quality of life, zoning and permitting, and financial participations on the site and area. Eleven
proposals were received and, following an extensive review, the Lenoir County site (Kinston Regional Jetport) was
identified as the preferred site. An Airport Master Plan was developed for the GPT which investigated several runway
layouts and a draft environmental assessment was prepared and coordinated with Federal and state environmental
agencies for their review and comments.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 182(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2242), the USTR has identified China as a priority foreign country
based on its failure to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights and fair and equitable
market access to persons relying on intellectual property protection. Pursuant to section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade
Act (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(2)(A)), the USTR has initiated an investigation of the acts, policies and practices that led
to the identification of China as a priority foreign country.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(a) of the Trade Act requires the USTR annually to identify foreign countries that deny adequate and effective
protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights or that deny fair and equitable market access to persons
that rely on intellectual property protection. On April 30, 1994, the USTR identified China as being among the group
of 36 foreign countries that fall into this category. At that time, the USTR noted that China's failures in this regard
were particularly problematic, and that its status under special 301 would be reviewed again in 60 days. A U.S. government
interagency team traveled to China in June to seek elimination or modification of the acts, policies, and practices
of concern, but found little movement from the Chinese government on these issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(c) of the Trade Act permits the USTR at any time during the year to identify as priority foreign countries
those trading partners that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, and practices that have the greatest
adverse impact (actual or potential) on relevant U.S. products. Section 302(b)(2)(A) of the Trade Act requires the
initiation of an investigation of the acts, policies, and practices which were the basis for the priority foreign
country identification unless the acts, policies, and practices are already the subject of an investigation or action
under the section 301 provisions of the Trade Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the severe problems with intellectual property protection and market access for persons that rely on intellectual
property protection in China, and the unwillingness of the Chinese government to address these problems through
productive consultations over the last 60 days, the USTR has designated China a priority foreign country and has initiated
an investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of its acts, policies, and practices in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While China has implemented most of its commitments under the 1992 Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government
of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Intellectual
Property, it has failed to create an effective intellectual property rights enforcement regime. Copyright piracy
in China is particularly acute, and trademark infringement remains a serious concern, with little indication of
their willingness to address these problems. Appropriate implementation of China's new patent law and administrative
protection program for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals is also of concern. Particular problems with
China's present enforcement regime include, among other things, internally inconsistent laws; a lack of transparency
in the enforcement structure; a lack of protection for existing works; gaps in responsibility in the enforcement
structure; a lack of consistent application of the laws throughout the central, provincial and local governments;
a lack of funding, training and education; the absence of clear and effective criminal penalties; possible conflicts
of interest; burdensome and discriminatory agency requirements; overly-broad compulsory licensing provisions;
a failure of enforcement authorities to coordinate; and the absence of an effective border control mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
China also fails to provide fair and equitable market access for persons who rely on intellectual property protection.
The most serious market access problems are found in the areas of audiovisual products, sound recordings, and published
written materials. Particular concerns include a hidden system of internal quotas, a lack of transparency, a lack
of consistency in application, monopoly control over the importation and distribution of products embodying intellectual
property, and a prohibition on the production or distribution of products embodying intellectual property that
is not related to the content of those products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 303(a) of the Trade Act, USTR has requested consultations with the Chinese government concerning
the issues under investigation. USTR will seek information and advice from the appropriate committees established
pursuant to section 135 of the Trade Act in preparing the U.S. presentations for such consultations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 6 months after the date on which this investigation was initiated (i.e., on or before December 30, 1994), pursuant
to section 304 of the Trade Act, the USTR must determine on the basis of the investigation and the consultations, whether
any act, policy or practice described in section 301 of the Trade Act exists and, if that determination is affirmative,
decide what action, if any, to take under section 301 of the Trade Act. The deadline for making those determinations
may be extended up to 9 months after the initiation of the investigation if the USTR determines that certain conditions
are met.
