SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to increase certain cost-of-living allowance
(COLA) rates paid to General Schedule, U.S. Postal Service, and certain other Federal employees in Kauai County,
Hawaii; Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The final regulations
also consolidate the two nonforeign COLA areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands into a single allowance area, delete obsolete
Commissary/Exchange COLA categories in four areas, clarify definitions shown in one of the appendices, and remove
from regulations three locations listed as places where nonforeign post differentials are paid. These three locations
are no longer territories or possessions of the United States and, therefore, are not covered by the nonforeign area
post differential program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 5941 of title 5, United States Code, certain Federal employees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous
States are eligible for cost-of-living allowances when local living costs are substantially higher than those in
the Washington, DC, area. Nonforeign area COLA's are currently paid in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM contracted with Runzheimer International to conduct living-cost surveys during the summer of 1993 in Hawaii,
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. At that time, Runzheimer also surveyed the Washington, DC, area, which
is the base or reference area for living-cost comparisons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to these surveys, the COLA rates should be increased in three areas and reduced in three other areas. However,
a provision in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;141
as amended), bars OPM from reducing any COLA rate through December 31, 1996. Therefore, only the COLA rate increases
are being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increases in COLA rates are summarized in the following table:

In computing the new COLA rate, OPM made two changes relative to the indices published with the proposed rule. The changes
were made to correct an error in one survey and to incorporate a methodological change recommended by one of the commenters
on the proposed rule. Neither of these changes affected the COLA rates proposed in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994 (at 59 FR 27314). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The error OPM corrected was the failure to price a homeowner insurance policy in Maui, Hawaii, that included coverage
of damage caused by high winds. Correcting this raised the Maui index slightly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodological change made by OPM was to use the Goods and Services Component index as the cash contributions item
index in the Miscellaneous Component. The effect of this change was a slight increase in the living-cost indices in
all areas except Puerto Rico. The chart below compares the indices shown in the notice that accompanied the proposed
rule and those used in this final rule. As noted above, none of these convert to a different COLA rate under the procedures
prescribed in 5 CFR 591.206(b).

In this final rule, OPM is also consolidating the two allowance areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands into a single allowance
area. The two allowance areas were (1) the island of St. Croix and (2) the islands of St. Thomas and St. John. The new allowance
area is titled ``The U.S. Virgin Islands.'' In future surveys, OPM will continue to survey living costs on both St.
Croix and St. Thomas, but the data will be consolidated to represent the Virgin Islands as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM is eliminating Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in Anchorage, Alaska; Fairbanks, Alaska; Honolulu, Hawaii;
and Puerto Rico. OPM is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate in the Guam/Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)
allowance area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), Federal civilian employees in the Anchorage,
Fairbanks, Honolulu, and Puerto Rico allowance areas do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 have access to commissaries by virtue of their Federal civilian employment. Commissary/Exchange COLA rates are
payable only to Federal white-collar employees who, by virtue of their Federal civilian employment, have unlimited
access to commissaries 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exchanges in the allowance areas. Since Federal civilian employees in these four areas do not have access to commissaries,
the Commissary/Exchange COLA rates are not payable in these areas. Accordingly, OPM is eliminating the Commissary/Exchange
COLA rates in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Guam/CNMI, on the other hand, DeCA says some Federal civilian employees have access to commissaries by virtue of
their Federal civilian employment. OPM believes these employees also have access to exchange facilities. Therefore,
OPM is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eliminating the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate in Guam/CNMI.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elimination of the Commissary/Exchange rates in the four areas should have no effect on the COLA paid to any employee.
Federal white-collar employees in these areas should be receiving the higher Local Retail COLA rate. Similarly,
although OPM does not control access to commissaries and exchanges, OPM believes its action should not affect the
commissary or exchange privileges that employees might otherwise enjoy. Therefore, if an employee in one of the four
areas finds that his or her COLA rate or access to commissaries or exchanges is adversely affected by the elimination
of the Commissary/Exchange COLA rate, the employee should contact his or her agency immediately, and the agency should
bring the issue to OPM's attention as quickly as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the terminology used in other areas where only one COLA rate is payable, OPM is retitling the ``Local
Retail'' COLA rate as the ``All Employees'' COLA rate in the four areas affected. The retitling will not affect the
COLA rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM is also clarifying the definitions used in appendix A to subpart B of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, because
the previous definitions were subject to misinterpretation. The new definitions address this problem. The changes
do not affect COLA rates or eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, OPM is also removing from the regulations three locations listed as places where nonforeign post differentials
are paid. The three locations are the Canton, Enderbury, and Christmas Islands. These islands are no longer territories
or possessions of the United States and, therefore, are not covered by the nonforeign area post differential program.

Summary and Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM received 127 comments on the proposed regulations and notice it published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994. Nearly all of these were from employees on St. Croix who endorsed the consolidation of the Virgin Islands
allowance areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM received one comment opposing the consolidation. The commenter believed the economies of St. Thomas and St. Croix
were significantly different and that living costs are higher on St. Thomas than on St. Croix. The commenter also suggested
that OPM survey St. Thomas twice a year, once in the ``tourist season'' and once in the ``off-season'' and average the
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there may be differences between St. Thomas and St. Croix, OPM believes consolidation will improve the survey
and the administration of the program. Living costs vary among and within many COLA areas, including the Virgin Islands.
The issue is whether it is practical to differentiate among the living costs of certain places. Generally, the smaller
the area surveyed, the more difficult it is to measure relative differences in living costs. By consolidating areas
where appropriate, OPM can improve the surveys and reduce unwarranted fluctuations in COLA's that otherwise might
occur. This is the purpose of the consolidation of the Virgin Islands allowance areas. OPM does not believe semi-annual
surveys of St. Thomas are necessary. OPM plans, however, to review survey timing in all allowance areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that St. Croix employees receive their increase retroactively to the date of the increase
in the St. Thomas COLA rate. OPM finds no basis for a retroactive adjustment. The previous St. Croix living-cost surveys
were conducted according to regulation and provided adequate measures of local living costs. Therefore, the St.
Croix COLA rates set pursuant to previous surveys are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that OPM review community selection in the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, allowance
area. The commenters believed some of the communities surveyed were not typical of places where Federal employees
live. OPM is reviewing community selections in all of the COLA survey areas in light of the results of the Federal Employee
Housing and Living Patterns Survey. OPM revised community selections in several areas prior to the summer 1994 surveys.
One of these allowance areas was the City and County of Honolulu. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed OPM had not complied with provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government
Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141, as amended by Pub. L. 103&hyph;329), as these provisions apply to
the COLA program. The law requires OPM to study living-cost issues and submit to Congress a report on possible changes
in the COLA methodology. The report is due March 1, 1996. The commenter thought the law directed OPM to make changes
in the COLA model before the report due date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we stated in our response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13844), OPM carefully reviewed
Pub. L. 102&hyph;141 and the related Senate Appropriations Committee report. OPM determined that the law has two
requirements: (1) COLA rates may not be reduced through December 31, 1995, and (2) OPM must submit a report to Congress
on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The law does not direct OPM to implement methodological changes at this
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Senate Committee, however, asked OPM to research specific methodological issues. OPM is doing this and plans
to include the results of its research in its report to Congress. Although the law does not require OPM to implement
changes, OPM will continue to make improvements in the COLA program, as appropriate. We are implementing some of these
changes with this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said OPM regulations should describe the COLA model and survey in greater detail. OPM believes the COLA
regulations are adequately detailed and that subjecting the survey process to a set of overly detailed and inflexible
rules would impair, rather than improve, the COLA program. The flexibility results in a more accurate COLA model because
improvements can be made from one year to the next. Such changes are made public because, before COLA rates are adjusted,
OPM publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a detailed report on the survey methodology and results. Employees have the opportunity to comment on any changes,
and OPM takes these comments into careful consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed OPM violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by publishing details after the survey.
He said OPM could not ``go back and replicate the data if it is subsequently determined that the changes were 'inappropriate.'''
The APA does not require OPM to make a change for each comment received. Instead, the APA requires OPM to inform the public
of certain proposals and actions, allow the public to comment on these, and take these comments into consideration.
This we do. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As evidenced in this final rule, OPM implements recommended changes as appropriate. With this rule, OPM is correcting
an error made in the calculation of the Maui index, implementing a new methodology for calculating the Miscellaneous
Component index, and eliminating Commissary/Exchange COLA rates in areas where they are no longer payable. OPM also
adopted, based in part on comments it received, community changes for the summer 1994 COLA surveys. Therefore, OPM
is in compliance with both the letter and spirit of the APA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said there was no basis in law for the pledge of confidentiality that is provided on the Background Survey
information collection materials, which was part of Appendix 5 of the report. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
as codified at 5 U.S.C. 552, allows the Government to withhold information from public release if the information
contains trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Generally, the
information collected in Background Surveys is privileged commercial information. Background Surveys are used
to identify items that will be priced and outlets at which the prices will be collected. To identify commonly purchased
items and popular outlets, information on such things as sales volume and market penetration are collected. This
information is protected from disclosure under FOIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed the COLA model was unnecessarily complex and suggested that it be simplified to use only one
income level. The commenter said this would reduce survey costs and the number of subjective assumptions required.
As we noted in our response to similar comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13845), OPM's regulations
require the measurement of living costs at multiple income levels. This approach recognizes that relative living
costs may vary by income level and that the distribution of employees by income level may vary among areas. The multiple
income approach, therefore, yields a more accurate measure of overall living-cost differences than a single income
approach. Nevertheless, to the extent that multiple income levels require additional subjective assumptions,
we agree that the overall integrity of the model might not be impaired by using a single income level. OPM is examining
this issue and plans to address it in its report to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also objected to Runzheimer's recommendation that OPM include income taxes in the COLA model. He believed
this would unduly complicate the model. As stated in previous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, OPM is studying issues relating to Federal, State, and local income taxes and plans to include the results
of this study in its report to Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter wanted the COLA model to take into account the ``objectively determinable'' costs of remoteness, isolation,
and special needs. He cited increased home maintenance, out-of-area college and university costs, and medical expenses
as examples of these extra costs. In comments on previous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, many employees identified special ``needs'' they believed were unique to their area. OPM has and is continuing
to research many of these issues, including home maintenance, college and university costs, and medical expenses.
We plan to include the results of this research in our report to Congress. At present, however, OPM believes the COLA
model reasonably and adequately measures cost differences for the vast majority of expenses that Federal employees
typically incur.

Noting the difficulty of comparing colleges and universities of equal quality, the commenter further proposed that
OPM measure the cost of higher education solely in the DC area. He said allowance area costs could be computed by adding
to the DC costs the extra expense of out-of-state tuition, room and board, and round-trip air travel between the allowance
areas and Washington, DC. Although this approach would address the problem of comparing the cost of an education of
like quality, we believe measuring costs in this manner would vastly overstate the costs incurred by most Federal
employees in the allowance areas. Measuring costs in this manner could also significantly understate the average
cost of college and university education incurred by Federal employees in the DC area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said items needed only in allowance areas should be priced in the allowance area, but not in DC. OPM is
researching the issue of special needs. While there may be consumer requirements unique to living in the allowance
areas, there also are consumer requirements unique to living in the Washington, DC, area. For the summer surveys,
the model does not address these issues because they are highly subjective, difficult to measure, and vary widely
among areas. Instead, the model compares the cost of an item in an allowance area with the cost for the same item in the
DC area. OPM believes this is consistent with the settlement of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which the plaintiffs asked OPM to adopt a methodology that compared specified brands, models, and sizes whenever
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note, however, that the Senate Appropriations Committee asked OPM to research the issue of items required in the
allowance area but not in the Washington, DC, area and include this research in its report to Congress. This OPM is doing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter recommended that OPM add 5 percentage points to all COLA rates to take into account costs that exist but
are not objectively determinable. OPM believes intangible factors, such as difficult living conditions, should
not be part of the COLA program. There are other programs, such as the post differential program, that compensate Federal
employees in such circumstances. OPM believes COLA should compensate employees for measurable differences in living
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if we agreed conceptually with such changes, significant changes in the law, Executive Order, and regulations
would be required to allow the adjustment of COLA for these intangible factors. The Senate Appropriations Committee
specifically asked OPM to study factors relating to remoteness and isolation and to report to Congress on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
legislative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
recommendations on how to calculate COLA's. Therefore, final resolution of these issues must await OPM's report
to Congress and subsequent congressional action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed employees in the allowance areas saved at a higher rate to afford the down payment for a house
or a car or to pay for college/university education. He said OPM should take this into consideration and adjust savings
and investments by the overall index for the area. The COLA model uses the same approach to savings and investments
as the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). That approach accounts for savings
and investments made for the purpose of future purchases in the category or component associated with the item to be
purchased. For example, savings made for the down payment or purchase of an automobile are accounted for in the private
transportation category. Therefore, if automobiles cost more in an allowance area and the purchaser must save more
to afford the car, the COLA model already takes this additional savings requirement into account. No additional adjustments
are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the savings and investment category in the Miscellaneous Component covers long-term savings and
investments, such as those made for retirement purposes. The category also includes life insurance. For Federal
employees, the cost of life insurance and required contributions to a Federal retirement system do not vary by geographic
area. Any additional insurance or contributions to the retirement systems are a matter of personal preference. Therefore,
it is appropriate to hold the index constant for these items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter objected to trimming high and low values in the housing component and use of trend analyses. The commenter
believed housing market price anomalies should be tolerated or that only ``obvious errors or anomalies'' should
be eliminated. The purpose of trimming and trend analyses is to stabilize the housing price data from one year to the
next. As OPM stated in its response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13846), trimming is essentially
a nonparametric technique similar to using the median rather than the average. OPM and Runzheimer considered using
the median but rejected it because the limited number of observations obtained in some smaller allowance areas could
cause the median to be erratic from one year to the next. Trimming provides stability; and because equal numbers of
high and low values are trimmed, no bias is introduced. Eliminating ``obvious anomalies'' would be a more subjective
process with a potential for bias.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter thought the age of the home should be included in home sales analyses. He recommended comparing prices
of homes of a similar age, size, and room count. Numerous factors influence home sale prices, but data on many of these
factors are not readily available. Runzheimer uses home size and room count as the major criteria in housing comparisons
because data on these factors are usually available in all areas and because these factors typically have a significant
influence on home prices. Age is not used because data on it frequently are not available and because OPM's initial
research indicates that its use may be problematic. Moreover, as noted in the report, the number of home sales observations
is limited in many areas. Stratifying these small quantities into age groups for purposes of comparison would complicate
the model_something the commenter wished to avoid. It would also probably introduce unwarranted fluctuations in
the housing index from one year to the next_something OPM wants to avoid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said the survey failed to take into consideration the use of solar water heaters in Hawaii and Guam. The
commenter believed the model did not account for the capital cost of such heaters or the possible reduction in overall
utility consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As OPM stated in its response to comments received on an earlier proposed rule (at 59 FR 13847), significant home features
and improvements generally are reflected in the selling price of the home. Therefore, living-cost surveys reflect
the cost of solar water heaters to the extent that such items influence home market values and are commonly found in
homes in any area, including Hawaii and Guam. If solar water heaters are so common that their use generally reduces
the consumption of utilities, the survey results will reflect lower utility costs. This is as it should be. The COLA
model compares overall living costs in the allowance area with overall living costs in the DC area. If housing is more
expensive and utility costs are lower because solar heaters are common, the final comparison of overall housing costs
will be equitable. No special consideration of capital improvement costs or reduced utility consumption is appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter said employees in the allowance areas face extreme weather disturbances, particularly typhoons or
hurricanes. He believed these weather disturbances and other climatic conditions result in higher costs, particularly
home insurance and maintenance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of homeowner's insurance is part of the COLA model. The policies priced include coverage of damage caused
by high winds (e.g., hurricane winds). As shown in Appendix 7 of the report, these policies are relatively expensive
in areas where severe weather is a problem. Other costs, such as the cost of repairing storm damage, are more difficult
to address in the surveys. Although it may be possible to price the cost of repairing or replacing an item such as a window
or a roof, it is difficult to know how often this must be done in each allowance area compared with the Washington, DC,
area. The same is true with other types of maintenance, such as painting. It is difficult to know what tasks, if any,
must be performed more often in the allowance areas than in the Washington, DC, area. OPM is researching these issues
and plans to discuss them in its report to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter objected to the selection of Los Angeles as the common destination point for comparing airfares. He
said the Los Angeles routes were highly competitive and resulted in lower fares compared with other destinations.
The commenter suggested pricing round-trip tickets from each area to Kansas City. As stated in the report, Los Angeles
was selected because it is a common point within the continental United States that is roughly equidistant from each
of the allowance areas and the Washington, DC, area. The route may be highly competitive, but that does not invalidate
cost comparisons. OPM is measuring the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
relative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cost of air travel. If competition reduces fares, the reductions will be reflected in the Washington, DC, to Los Angeles
fares as well as in the allowance area to Los Angeles fares. Therefore, OPM believes the comparisons are appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also felt that the COLA model did not measure true air transportation costs. He said inter-island travel
and travel to the contiguous 48 States required more frequent use of air transportation. The COLA model does not account
for regional differences in the frequency of transportation. It assumes the typical Federal employee uses air travel
occasionally but mainly travels by private automobile, putting 15,000 miles per year on a car. The model may underestimate
the cost of air travel for some allowance area residents, but it probably overestimates private transportation costs
for others because it is unlikely that most island residents would put 15,000 miles per year on their cars. Needless
to say, OPM would prefer to employ better usage estimates for both private and air transportation. To this end, OPM
is researching transportation issues and plans to include the results of this research in its report to Congress.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believed the medical expense portion of the Miscellaneous Component failed to reflect the higher out-of-pocket
expenses that some Federal employees in the allowance areas incur. The commenter cited as examples the higher price
of medical service, the absence of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's), and the need to travel outside the area
to obtain some medical services. The COLA model takes into consideration relative differences in medical costs.
For example, the report indicated that medical costs in Honolulu are roughly 10 percent above those in the Washington,
DC, area. OPM notes that HMO's are very popular in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and that all of the allowance areas have medical
facilities that provide commonly required medical services. Nevertheless, OPM is researching issues relating
to medical expenses. The results of that research will be incorporated in our report to Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter criticized the methodology used for catalog pricing. He assumed DC employees do not purchase by catalog
but that allowance areas employees do because certain items were not locally available. Consequently, he recommended
comparing allowance area catalog prices with over-the-counter prices in the Washington, DC, area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the report, catalogs are a popular form of retailing in both the allowance areas and in the Washington,
DC, area. The COLA model includes catalog sales to reflect this common type of shopping and to allow the comparison
of the prices of certain items for which the same brands, models, and sizes are difficult to find in the allowance areas
and in the Washington, DC, area. OPM does not agree with the commenter's assumption that people only purchase from
catalogs when the item is not available locally. People make catalog purchases for a variety of reasons, including
price, convenience, and availability. Numerous catalog merchandisers compete in the allowance areas and in the
Washington, DC, area. It would be inappropriate, therefore, to compare allowance area catalog prices with over-the-counter
prices in the DC area. In the employee survey, OPM asked employees about their purchasing patterns, including whether
they typically purchase various types of items by catalog. OPM plans to include the results of this survey in its report
to Congress.

The commenter criticized OPM for using old consumer expenditure information to weight commissary and exchange prices.
OPM acknowledges it is using older information. As evidenced in this final rule, however, OPM has been researching
commissary and exchange usage to discern which Federal employees have such access and in which areas. OPM plans to
continue and expand this research, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter assumed that employees who are paid the commissary and exchange COLA rate would have commissary and
exchange access if stationed in the Washington, DC, area. He recommended, therefore, comparing commissary and exchange
prices in the allowance areas with commissary and exchange prices in the DC area.

Executive Order 10000 requires OPM to ``*&blank;*&blank;*make appropriate deductions when *&blank;*&blank;*
commissary or other purchasing privileges are furnished as a result of Federal civilian employment at a cost substantially
lower than the prevailing costs in the allowance area concerned.'' Commissary and exchange prices in Guam are significantly
lower than prevailing prices. Therefore, a reduction in the COLA rate is warranted. The methodology used to calculate
the Commissary and Exchange COLA rate involves the comparison of a weighted average of local retail prices and commissary
and exchange prices in the allowance area with local retail prices only in the Washington, DC, area. This methodology
was reviewed and upheld by the court in

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations
to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary inspection, identification,
certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. The fees reflect the increased costs
of providing these services primarily as a result of Federal salary increases allocated by Congress under the Federal
Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) provide for mandatory inspection by Federal inspectors of meat and poultry slaughtered and/or processed at official
establishments. Such inspection is required to ensure the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat and
poultry products. The costs of mandatory inspection (excluding such services performed on holidays or on an overtime
basis) are borne by FSIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to mandatory inspection, FSIS provides a range of voluntary inspection services (9 CFR 350.7, 351.8,
351.9, 352.5, 354.101, 355.12, and 362.5). The costs of voluntary inspection are totally recoverable by the Federal
Government. These services, set forth in Subchapter B_Voluntary Inspection and Certification Service, are provided
under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.) to assist in the orderly marketing of various animal products and byproducts not subject to the Federal Meat Inspection
Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees charged by FSIS for voluntary inspection services provided to operators of official meat and poultry establishments,
importers, or exporters are reviewed annually and a cost analysis

or laboratory services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the projected Fiscal Year 1994 cost analysis, FSIS is increasing the fees for voluntary services. These increased
costs are attributable to the average FSIS locality pay raise of 3.2 percent for Federal employees effective January
1994; the increasing number of employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System and subject to the Federal
Insurance Contributions Act tax; and increased health insurance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 27, 1994, FSIS published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 32940) to increase the fees charged by FSIS to provide overtime and holiday inspection, voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, identification, certification, or laboratory services to meat and poultry establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS received one comment in response to the proposal. The comment was from the owner of a small meat establishment
who felt that the current fee of $30.72 per hour was excessive and a burden on his company. After analyzing the available
data relating to costs of providing these services, FSIS has determined that these rates reflect the cost of providing
inspection services. The new rates reflect only an incremental increase in the costs currently borne by those entities
electing to utilize overtime and holiday inspection services and certain other voluntary inspection services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To recover these increased costs in an expeditious manner, the Administrator has determined that these amendments
should be effective less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under Executive Order 12866. The fees provided for in this rule reflect a minimal increase in the costs currently borne
by those entities which elect to utilize certain voluntary inspection services. As discussed in the background of
this document, the increase in fees reflects the increased costs of providing these services primarily as a result
of Federal salary increases allocated by Congress under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not intended to have retroactive effect. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions, all applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative procedures must be exhausted. Under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products Inspection Acts, the administrative
procedures are set forth in 7 CFR Part 1.

Effect on Small Entities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service, has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).
The fees reflect a minimal increase in the costs currently borne by those entities which elect to utilize certain inspection
services.

 are to facilitate the meetings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There will be no admission fee or other charge to attend or to participate in the meetings. The meetings will be open
to all persons who are scheduled to present statements or who register on the day of the meeting (between 10:45 a.m.
and 11:45 a.m.) subject to availability of space in the meeting rooms. The meetings may adjourn early if scheduled
speakers complete their statements in less time than is scheduled for the meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An individual, whether speaking in a personal or a representative capacity on behalf of an organization, may be
limited to a 10-minute statement. If possible, we will notify the speaker if additional time is available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The DOT will try to accommodate all speakers. If the available time does not permit this, speakers generally will
be scheduled on a first-come-first-served basis. However, the DOT reserves the right to exclude some speakers if
necessary to present a balance of viewpoints and issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Sign and oral interpretation can be made available at the meeting, as well as an assistive listening device, if
requested 10 calendar days before the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Representatives of the DOT will preside over the meeting. A panel of DOT and FAA personnel involved in this issue
will be present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The meeting will be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the meeting and any material accepted by the DOT
representatives during the meeting will be included in the public docket. Any person who is interested in purchasing
a copy of the transcript should contact the court reporter directly. Additional transcript purchase information
will be available at the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

five copies of all materials to be presented for distribution to the DOT representatives; other copies may be provided
to the audience at the discretion of the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Statements made by DOT representatives are intended to facilitate discussion of the issues or to clarify issues.
Any statement made during the meeting by a DOT representative is not intended to be, and should not be construed as,
a position of the DOT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The meetings are designed to solicit public views and more complete information on the High Density Rule. Therefore,
the meetings will be conducted in an informal and nonadversarial manner. No individual will be subject to cross-examination

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form amendments to the regulations issued under
the Government Securities Act of 1986 (the ``Government Securities Act'' or ``GSA'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires registered government securities brokers and dealers to comply with
the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'' or ``SEC'') Rule 17a&hyph;11 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), with certain modifications. The SEC has amended Rule
17a&hyph;11 and the Department's amendments parallel the SEC's changes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments will, among other things, ease the regulatory and reporting burdens on registered government securities
brokers and dealers by eliminating the requirement that they submit certain supplemental financial reports previously
required by &sect;405.3 of the GSA regulations. Registered government securities brokers and dealers will remain
obligated to transmit notice of a capital deficiency or certain other events.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
When the Department first adopted rules and regulations affecting government securities brokers and dealers, it
took into consideration the already existing regulation of securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC
under sections 15 or 15B of the Exchange Act, with a view toward preventing overly burdensome or duplicative regulations.
In that regard, the GSA regulations incorporated, by reference, many of the SEC's rules regulating brokers and dealers,
including, with modification, Rule 17a&hyph;11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 7, 1993, the SEC adopted amendments to 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;11 (Rule 17a&hyph;11), which became effective
August 12, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The primary purpose of Rule 17a&hyph;11 is to provide the SEC and other regulatory bodies with advance warning and
information regarding brokers and dealers that are experiencing financial or operational difficulty. Prior to
the SEC's amendments, Rule 17a&hyph;11 required a broker or dealer to give notice and transmit supplemental reports
to the Commission and other regulatory bodies when its net capital declined below its required minimum level or when
its total outstanding principal amount of satisfactory subordination agreements exceeded allowable levels for
more than 90 days. The SEC's amendments, among other things, eliminated the requirement that brokers and dealers
file Part II or Part IIA of Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5, Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (``FOCUS
Report'') after a net capital deficiency. Brokers and dealers, however, remain obligated to transmit same-day notice
of such a capital deficiency. Additionally, prior to the amendments to Rule 17a&hyph;11, brokers and dealers whose
net capital fell below certain ``early warning levels''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 were required to file monthly FOCUS Report for at least three successive months. This requirement was eliminated
by the amendments and replaced with the requirement that brokers and dealers promptly notify the Commission and their
designated examining authority (``DEA'') of the triggering event. However, the changes to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11
did not apply to registered government securities brokers and dealers because the Treasury is the rulemaker for these
firms.

Early warning levels are capital levels set at amounts that are higher than the minimum capital requirement. In situations
where the capital level of a broker or dealer is declining, the early warning level serves the purpose of alerting regulatory
agencies that the firm may be experiencing financial or operational difficulty. This early notification enables
the regulatory agencies to monitor the activities of a broker-dealer and assess its financial condition while there
is still time to take action to prevent the broker-dealer from falling out of compliance with the minimum capital requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires, with certain modifications, every registered government securities
broker or dealer to comply with Rule 17a&hyph;11. Consistent with the SEC's pre-amendment Rule 17a&hyph;11, &sect;405.3
has required registered government securities brokers and dealers, including interdealer brokers and futures
commission merchants (FCMs), to provide notice of capital deficiencies, to submit financial reports within 24 hours
of a capital deficiency, and to file supplemental reports for three successive months when capital falls below early
warning levels. Since the SEC's amendments to Rule 17a&hyph;11, without conforming amendments to &sect;405.3 of
the GSA regulations, the rules applicable to government securities brokers and dealers have been unclear. At the
time of the amendments to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, Treasury was unable to revise the GSA regulations accordingly because
its rulemaking authority had expired in October 1991 and reauthorization legislation was still being considered
by the Congress.

The Treasury supported the SEC changes to Rule 17a&hyph;11 and took action to relieve registered government securities
brokers and dealers of the requirement to file supplemental financial reports under &sect;405.3, pending the reauthorization
of Treasury's rulemaking authority and the issuance of conforming amendments. Accordingly, on August 27, 1993,
at the request of Department staff, the SEC staff issued to no-action letter
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 stating that no action would be recommended to the Commission if a DEA waived the financial report filing requirements
of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, as modified and made applicable to registered government securities brokers and dealers
by &sect;405.3, provided that:

Letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange

(1) a registered government securities broker or dealer gives notice the same day of the event in accordance with Rule
17a&hyph;11:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) if the liquid capital of a government securities broker-dealer subject to the financial responsibility requirements
of &sect;402.2 under the GSA declines below the minimum amount required by &sect;402.2, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) if the net capital of a government securities interdealer broker subject to the financial responsibility requirements
of &sect;402.1(e) of the GSA declines below the minimum amount required by &sect;402.1(e), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) if the net capital of a registered government securities broker or dealer that is also an FCM registered with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') falls below the greater of (i) the minimum amount required by Rule
15c3&hyph;1 (17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1) or (ii) the minimum amount required by CFTC Rule 1.17 (17 CFR 1.17); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) a registered government securities broker or dealer gives notice promptly (within 24 hours) in accordance with
Rule 17a&hyph;11 upon the occurrence of an event that would require under &sect;405.3 the filing of a Report on Finances
and Operations of Government Securities Brokers and Dealers (``FOGS Report'') or FOCUS Report.

The no-action letter also noted that Treasury's rulemaking authority had expired, but that Treasury staff intended,
upon reauthorization of its rulemaking authority, to amend its regulations under the GSA to conform to the SEC's amendments
to Rule 17a&hyph;11. The Treasury's rulemaking authority was reauthorized on December 17, 1993, with the enactment
of the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 thus enabling the Department to make this rule change.

A. Section 405.3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The new rule eliminates the prior requirement that registered government securities brokers or dealers file financial
reports within 24 hours after a liquid or net capital deficiency by adopting paragraph (b) of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Registered government securities brokers and dealers will remain obligated to transmit notice of a liquid or net
capital deficiency on the same day of the occurrence. However, unlike the previous rule, the amendments require the
notice to specify the registered government securities broker's or dealer's capital requirement and its current
amount of capital. This latter requirement does not impose any additional burdens on registered government securities
brokers and dealers because they are required to continually monitor their minimum capital requirement and their
current amount of capital to ensure compliance with the Department's capital rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 405.3 also adopts the requirement of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11(b) that a broker or dealer must give notice of a capital
deficiency when it is informed by its DEA or the Commission that it is, or has been, in violation of the capital requirements,
even if it does not agree with that determination. In the event of such a dispute, the broker or dealer may state in its
notice the arguments for its disagreement with the capital deficiency determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that registered government securities brokers and dealers file Part II or Part IIA of the FOGS Report,
or in limited cases the FOCUS Report, within 15 calendar days after the end of the next three months if their capital
falls below certain early warning levels is also eliminated. In lieu of this requirement, and consistent with the
SEC's Rule, &sect;405.3(a)(5) requires that, in the event a registered government securities broker's or dealer's
capital falls below certain early warning levels, it is required to file notice of such event promptly (within 24 hours).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405.3(a)(5) also adds a new early warning level based on minimum capital after haircuts for registered government
securities brokers or dealers other than government securities interdealer brokers and government securities
brokers and dealers that also are FCMs. In addition to sending prompt notice any time their liquid capital is less than
150 percent of haircuts, such government securities brokers and dealers also have to send a notice when their liquid
capital after deducting total haircuts is less than 120 percent of their minimum capital requirement. This is consistent
with the SEC early warning level for net capital and especially important for a registered government securities
broker or dealer that may have no haircuts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments to &sect;405.3 of the GSA regulations conform the notification provisions applicable to registered
government securities brokers and dealers to the requirements applicable to diversified brokers and dealers registered
with the SEC. The Department is conforming the regulations under the GSA to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11 to ensure consistent
regulatory treatment for all classes of government securities brokers and dealers registered with the Commission
and to reduce the reporting burdens on registered government securities brokers and dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that there is no reason for registered government securities brokers or dealers to file reports
in circumstances where other brokers or dealers registered with the SEC are not filing reports. Further, the same-day
notice requirement provides the Commission and the DEAs adequate warning of financial or operational problems,
thereby enabling them to increase the surveillance of a registered government securities broker or dealer experiencing
difficulty and to obtain any additional information necessary to assess the broker's or dealer's financial condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the revisions of SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, the Department is also making minor housekeeping changes to &sect;405.3(a)
by deleting paragraphs 405.3(a) (4) and (5), which are no longer applicable, and redesignating the remaining paragraphs.
To correct an oversight, the Department is adding new paragraph 405.3(c)(7) that indicates that references in SEC
Rule 17a&hyph;11 to &sect;240.17a&hyph;3, relating to records, mean &sect;404.2 of the GSA regulations. This provision,
which appears in paragraphs 405.3 (a) and (b), was inadvertently excluded from paragraph 405.3(c) when the implementing
GSA regulations were adopted in July 1987.

B. Technical Amendments to Section 402.2d
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department is also making a technical amendment to paragraph (j) of &sect;402.2d of the GSA regulations. Currently,
paragraph (j) of &sect;402.2d, which modifies &sect;240.15c3&hyph;1d(c)(5)(i), prohibits a registered government
securities broker or dealer from entering into a temporary subordinated loan during any period in which the broker
or dealer is subject to ``any of the reporting provisions'' of &sect;405.3. Although the requirement in &sect;405.3
to file supplemental financial reports (i.e., FOGS or FOCUS Reports) in the event of a capital deficiency or the breaching
of early warning levels is being eliminated, the Department is retaining the capital rule's prohibition against
a registered government securities broker or dealer obtaining a temporary subordinated loan during a period of financial
or operational difficulty. Accordingly, paragraph (j) is being amended to prohibit a registered government securities
broker or dealer from obtaining a temporary subordinated loan if it has given notice under &sect;405.3 within the
preceding thirty days. This amendment will enable the DEAs to prevent a registered government securities broker
or dealer from obtaining temporary loans during periods in which the broker or dealer may be experiencing financial
or operational difficulties.

III. Special Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because this final rule is merely a conforming amendment, the Department has determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' as defined in Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)), the Department for good cause
finds that issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking and requesting comment are unnecessary. This rulemaking merely
makes corrections to the existing GSA rule to conform it to the amendments to the SEC rule upon which it is based. The
rule makes no independent substantive changes in the treatment of government securities brokers and dealers_they
have previously been subject to reporting requirements parallel to other registered brokers and dealers, and they
will continue to be subject to reporting requirements parallel to other registered brokers and dealers. This rule
change imposes no additional burdens or requirements on government securities brokers and dealers. For these reasons,
the Department is issuing the rule in final form, with an immediate effective date, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no notice and public comment are required for this rulemaking, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), do not apply. In addition, the information collections concerning this rule have been previously reviewed and
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) and assigned
control number 1535&hyph;0089. This rulemaking makes no substantive change to the information collection requirements
except to delete the requirement that a registered government securities broker or dealer file a FOGS or FOCUS Report
after experiencing a capital deficiency or triggering the early warning level notice requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 223(a)(7) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715n(a)(7)) (the Act) authorizes HUD to insure mortgages
given to refinance existing HUD-insured mortgages under any section or title of the Act. HUD has implemented Section
223(a)(7) in each of its regulations authorizing the insurance of mortgage refinancing, including 24 CFR parts 207,
213, 220, 221, 231, 232, 236, 241, and 242. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to requirements of the Act, each of these parts limits the principal amount of the refinanced mortgage to the lower
of: (a) the original principal amount of the existing mortgage, or (b) the unpaid balance of the existing mortgage,
to which certain HUD-approved items may be added. Additionally, each of these parts, except parts 241 (supplemental
loans) and 242 (hospitals), prohibited the refinanced mortgage amount from exceeding a stated percentage of the
Federal Housing Commissioner's estimate of value of the project after completion of any repairs, improvements,
or additions to the property. Unlike the limitation noted above, the value criterion was not a statutory requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value criterion precluded many troubled projects from refinancing their HUD-insured mortgages, thus preventing
them from lowering their debt service payments and gaining a sounder financial footing. Because Section 223(a)(7)
mortgages are already limited by the amount of the original insured mortgage, HUD felt the public interest and HUD's
Insurance Fund would be better served by allowing these loans to be refinanced to take advantage of lower interest
rates. Accordingly, on October 26, 1993, HUD published an interim rule (58 FR 57558) removing the value criterion
from those sections of HUD's regulations implementing Section 223(a)(7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the interim rule stated that the rule would cease to be effective after October 26, 1994, unless before
that date HUD published it as a final rule. The final rule is currently in the last stages of review by HUD and the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) and will be published upon approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent a period during which there is no rule in effect on this subject, the Department is extending the effective
date of the interim rule deleting the value criterion in Section 223(a)(7) refinancing, from October 26, 1994, until
April 26, 1995. This action extends the potential effective period from 11 months to 18 months which is in accordance
with internal Departmental guidelines on interim rules. However, the Department anticipates that a final rule will
be published well before the expiration of the 18-month period. The final rule would supersede the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the extension of the interim rule, the Department also is extending the Expedited Section 223(a)(7)
Processing Instructions (issued November 24, 1993 for use by the Department). The instructions will now be effective
until April 26, 1995, unless otherwise superseded.

I. Background on the Indiana Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana plan. Background information
on the Indiana plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the Indiana
plan can be found in the July 26, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(47 FR 32110). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at
30 CFR 914.20 and 914.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 410 of SMCRA authorizes the Secretary to use funds under the AMLR program to abate or control emergency situations
in which adverse effects of past coal mining pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or general welfare.
On September 29, 1982 (47 FR 42729), OSM invited States to amend their AMLR Plans for the purpose of undertaking emergency
reclamation programs on behalf of OSM. States would have to demonstrate that they have the statutory authority to
undertake emergencies, the technical capability to design and supervise the emergency work, and the administrative
mechanisms to quickly respond to emergencies either directly or through contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of 30 CFR 884.15, any State may submit proposed amendments to its approved AMLR Plan. If the proposed
amendments change the scope or major policies followed by the State in the conduct of its AMLR program, the Director
must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14 in reviewing and approving or disapproving the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed assumption of the AMLR emergency program on behalf of OSM is a major addition to the Indiana AMLR plan.
Therefore, to asume the emergency program, Indiana must revise the Indiana Plan to include conducting the AML emergency
program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 47 FR 42729 (September 29, 1982), as to its authority and procedures for implementing an emergency response reclamation
program based on the provisions in Section 410 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95&hyph;87
(SMCRA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The agency designated by the Governor as authorized to receive grants and administer an emergency program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A legal opinion from the chief legal officer that the designated agency has the authority under State law to conduct
the emergency program in accordance with the requirements of Section 410 of Title IV of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A description of the policies and procedures to be followed by the designated agency in conducting the reclamation

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The purpose of the emergency response reclamation activities to be undertaken by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Reclamation is to enter upon any land where an emergency exists and on any other land to have
access to the land where the emergency exists and restore, reclaim, abate, control or prevent the adverse effect of
coal mining practices and to do all things necessary or expedient to protect the public health, safety, or general
welfare. For the purposes of this plan amendment emergency is defined as a sudden danger or impairment that presents
a high probability of substantial physical harm to the health, safety, or general welfare of people before the danger
can be abated under normal program operation procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources will assume authority for all emergency projects within Indiana and
will coordinate work with the Federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM). Coordination
with other state or local agencies will be on a project specific basis. The Department of Administration will be a key
component in the procurement of goods and services for emergency work. Assistance is also available from the Indiana
Department of Transportation and the Indiana State Emergency Management Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All investigations and eligibility findings required by Title IV of SMCRA will be conducted by the Division of Reclamation.
This information on emergency investigations will be provided to OSM. Once OSM makes a finding of fact that an emergency
situation exists, the state will undertake the specific construction efforts approved by OSM to abate the declared
emergency situation.

c. Land acquisition for emergency projects will follow the guidelines as stated in Indiana's approved State Plan.
The state will acquire lands in emergency situations where no other practical means are available to abate an immediate
threat to the health, safety or general welfare of its citizens. Policies, procedures and authority to acquire lands
is clearly detailed in the approved State Plan in the sections entitled Land Acquisition, Management and Disposal.
Indiana does not consider land acquisition to be a preferred step in reclamation projects and will therefore proceed
with this option only under unique circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The policies and procedures for emergency reclamation on private and public lands will be the same as for other AML
reclamation activities and detailed in the approved State Plan at 884.13(c)(5) and (6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources may enter on any land where an emergency exists or on adjacent lands
for access, in order to protect the public health, safety or general welfare from adverse effects of coal mining. It
is the policy of the State of Indiana to respect the rights of private ownership, and the state will make all reasonable
efforts to obtain a written consent from the owner of record in advance of emergency reclamation. The consent for right
of entry shall be in the form of a signed agreement with the land owner or the authorized agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources will publish a legal notice in a general circulation newspaper within
each county potentially affected by this emergency program assumption. These legal notices will provide for a thirty-day
comment period and will include the possibility of conducting public meetings in order to resolve any issues of general
concern. Each notice will include a statement of availability of this emergency reclamation amendment package.
All comments received on this amendment will be incorporated by reference to this document and made available to any
interested parties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.i. Administrative procedures for investigating and reporting emergency complaints will include on-site visitation
by a qualified staff member to make findings of fact and to document through a written report and photograph the current
status of the complaint. A complaint information gathering guide will aid in complaint investigation. Emergency
response will entail having a qualified staff member on-site as soon as is practicable. Urgency of the response time
will be determined by the initial description of the complaint received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.ii. As soon as is practical, eligibility information will be obtained and reported for each potential emergency.
This information will include written determination of: (1) whether the site was mined for coal; (2) the dates, types,
and operations of any and all mines at the site, and (3) the existence of any continuing reclamation responsibility
at the site. This information will be provided to the appropriate legal staff in order to allow them to make an eligibility
determination for emergency reclamation. It is desirable but not necessary to have all required legal documents
completed prior to initiating emergency reclamation activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.iii. All rights of entry and necessary appraisals will be executed according to the procedures outlined above and
as described in the approved State Plan. It is desirable but not necessary to have all required realty documents completed
prior to initiating emergency reclamation activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.iv. Administrative procedures for project supervision will be the responsibility of the assigned project manager
and will fit within the approved administrative structure of the Division of Reclamation as outlined in the approved
State Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c.v. Final project inspection and preparation and submission of final project reports will be conducted in conjunction
with the OSM Indianapolis field office. The assigned project manager and the pertinent grants staff of the division
of Reclamation will be responsible for the preparation of all technical, programmatic and financial reports and
documents. Approval by administrative staff of the Division of Reclamation of all reports to OSM will be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The purchasing and procurement systems to be used by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation
under the emergency reclamation program will be those currently used for securing goods and services under other
aspects of the AML program, with the following special conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Emergency reclamation will have priority over all other requests originating within the Division of Reclamation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Purchase orders for emergency work will be ``hand carried'' through the administrative system to allow approval
within the shortest time frame possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A list of potential contractors and/or suppliers will be maintained for ready reference quick contact by the Restoration
Section. This list will be updated as necessary to include all capable potential contractors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
4. In most cases, work will be allowed to proceed on the basis of verbal approval and a commitment for written follow-up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Division of Reclamation has developed, and is using, an emergency reclamation contracting system that expedites
the securing of abatement work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The accounting system to be used by the Division of Reclamation for the emergency program projects will be the same
as currently utilized for all other AML reclamation projects. Emergency program accounting will be on a project basis.
All emergency project obligations, payments and drawdowns will be tracked individually and separately and will
be done in accord with Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The Division of Reclamation has expertise in the disciplines necessary to implement the emergency program. Staff
engineers have a great deal of experience in reclamation designs for all types of problems anticipated to be encountered
in the emergency program. These may include, but are not limited to: filling and/or sealing mine openings or subsidence,
monitoring, grouting under or stabilizing ground affected by area subsidence or slides, refuse fires, roadway failures,
and flooding due to clogged streams. The Emergency Program Coordinator will specialize in correction of emergency
events and will be the lead staff person with support from the expertise of other Division of Reclamation specialists.
Technical consultation will be available to staff from OSM, U.S. Bureau of Mines, consultants, and the Indiana Division
of Engineering among others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical capability to supervise emergency work is the same as the Division of Reclamation's project managers currently
use to perform on-site supervision and inspection of other AML projects. Procedures for field supervision will evolve
as Indiana's experience in emergency reclamation grows. However, the existing field operations manual provides
an excellent starting point of all emergency reclamation supervision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The OSM has been conducting emergency reclamation for almost twelve years in the State of Indiana. There have been
approximately 190 emergency investigations, with 85 declared or given emergency status. The majority of all emergency
projects have been related to subsidence (71), while shaft openings (9), slides (4), and refuse fires (1) account
for the balance of declared emergencies. The distribution by county of both emergency projects and investigations
has been documented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Emergencies related to subsidence have been primarily the result of small pit type subsidence. This subsidence
is customarily associated with shallow underground mining. The potential for future emergency reclamation due
to subsidence is very large and widespread in the Indiana coal fields.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Narrative description which supports the State's position that the procedures, personnel and other proposed
aspects of its program give evidence of its abilities to promptly and effectively mitigate the full range of anticipated
emergency conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of the Indiana abandoned mine land program are to fulfill the general reclamation objectives set out
in Section 403 of P.L. 95&hyph;87. The highest priorities of the program are the protection of public health, safety
and general welfare from dangers resulting from the adverse effects of past coal mining. The emergency response program
described in this document provides an additional means whereby the State of Indiana will be able to protect its citizens
from these adverse effects consistent with the intent of Section 410 of P.L. 95&hyph;87. Indiana has the procedures,
personnel, and administrative functions within the Department of Natural Resources to capably and effectively
manage the emergency program as described in the previous sections, and is willing and able to work with OSM to insure
its success.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional objective of the State of Indiana in assuming the administration of the emergency program from OSM is
to provide continued protection to the citizens of this state. The State of Indiana must secure cooperation from OSM
in providing prompt emergency declaration as well as complete and adequate grant funding to carry out the work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 405 of SMCRA, OSM finds that Indiana submitted an amendment to its AMLR plan, subsequently
revised and clarified, and it has been determined, pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15, that:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The State provided adequate notice and opportunity for public comment in the development of the amendment and the
record does not reflect major unresolved controversies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Views of other Federal agencies having an interest in the plan have been solicited and considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The State has the legal authority, policies and administrative structure necessary to implement the amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed plan amendment meets all requirements of the OSM AMLR program provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The State has an approved Surface Mining Regulatory Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The amendment is in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds therefore, that the proposed Indiana plan amendment allowing the State to assume responsibility
for an emergency response reclamation program on behalf of OSM is no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective
than the Federal regulations and can be approved.

Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to speak at a public hearing, no hearing
was held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Agency Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(a)(2) and 884.15(a), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various
other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Indiana plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the original submittal (November 17, 1992), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service
responded and stated that it had no comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the December 6, 1993, reopening of the public comment period, the USDA, Soil Conservation Service (SCS)
responded and stated that they did not see where the proposed language would impact the Rural Abandoned Mine Program
administered by the SCS. The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded and stated that it has no comment.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record
No. IND&hyph;1303). EPA did not respond to OSM's request.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed AMLR plan amendment as submitted by Indiana on November
17, 1992, and revised on October 29, 1993, and on June 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 914.25, codifying decisions concerning the Indiana plan, are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective October 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation
plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and adopted by a specific State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions
on proposed State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State or Tribe
are based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243)
and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned
mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior [516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph
8.4B(29)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant
economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

 on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16123), the Department of Defense is amending the Rule to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Delete section 91.7(d) and the accompanying ``Market Test.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Establish the requirements for an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) application for real property in a revised
section 91.7(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Establish criteria that will be used to evaluate EDC applications in a revised section 91.7(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provide guidance for greater flexibility on the compensation to the Federal Government for property conveyed
under an EDC in a revised section 91.7(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the following amendment is limited to the real property conveyance section of the rule &sect;&sect;91.7
(d), (e), and (f), and not the entire April 6, 1994, interim final rule. A final rule addressing all of the elements of
the interim final rule will be published in early 1995. The Department of Defense will also publish a guidebook describing
the base conversion process.

On July 2, 1993, President Clinton announced a major new policy to speed the economic recovery of communities affected
by base closures or realignments. The President requested that Congress provide additional authority to expedite
the reuse of closing military bases. Congress agreed, and passed this new authority, Title XXIX of the National Defense
Authorization Act for FY 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2903 of Title XXIX gave the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer property to local redevelopment
authorities at or below fair market value. The Department of Defense implemented this authority by creating an additional
tool for local communities to help foster economic development through the creation of a new form of conveyance, referred
to as the ``Economic Development Conveyance '' (EDC). Under an EDC, the Department may transfer property to a Local
Redevelopment Authority (``LRA'') at or below estimated fair market value for purposes of economic development.
(Property may also be transferred under a series of other existing public benefit conveyances.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1994, (59 FR 16123), the Department of Defense published an interim final rule that provided base closure
communities with guidance on how to use the new authority. During the public comment process, the Department of Defense
learned that some of the procedures contained in the interim final rule may be impractical and not assist in reaching
the rapid economic redevelopment goals. As a result, they are being revised by this amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the interim final rule established a ``market test'' or ``market survey'' as a precondition to any
EDC. This approach was designed to help determine whether immediate private development of a property was possible
by advertising its availability and soliciting private interest. Many comments suggested that private developers
would not spend the time and money necessary to prepare a detailed expression of interest until after a community redevelopment
plan was approved, if at all. Additionally, the interim final rule was perceived to encourage private developers
to ``cherry-pick'' valuable parcels for private sector sales and leave the less attractive parcels for the community
redevelopment. This effort was said to be inconsistent with proper planning methods and not in the long-term interest
of enhancing local economic recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the assistance of comments received during the public comment period of the interim final rule, the Department
of Defense has been persuaded that such solicitation is unlikely to be fruitful unless and until the local community
provides the necessary investment and infrastructure for development: zoning, public utilities, etc. As a result,
the Department is eliminating the ``market test'' and creating with this Amendment a new process for an EDC that will
consider such information, as addressed by the local redevelopment plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule also prescribed procedures and guidelines for recoupment of value by the Federal Government
if and when net proceeds were realized by development. Based upon experience since its publication and public comment,
the Department of Defense is persuaded that greater flexibility is needed in this area.

The interim final rule amendment being published today addresses some of the concerns raised by affected communities
and others. This amendment eliminates the ``market test'' requirements, includes a new application and review process
for an EDC, and establishes criteria to evaluate the applications as a substitute for the ``market test.'' Greater
flexibility is given to the Military Departments and the communities to negotiate the terms and conditions of the
EDC. A detailed application, including the approved community redevelopment plan, will now be the basis for a determination
of whether or not an LRA will be eligible for an EDC. The application and review process will also be used to help determine
the terms and conditions of such a conveyance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Amendment is an intermediate step before the April 6, 1994, interim final rule is reissued as a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What is an Economic Development Conveyance (EDC)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An EDC is a new process for transferring real property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) to help spur local economic
development and job creation. An EDC may be with or without initial payment or with only partial payment at time of transfer,
may be at or below the estimated fair market value of the property, and allows for negotiated terms and conditions of
payment (consideration) to the Department of Defense. These negotiations must be fair and reasonable to both parties
and strike a balance between compensation to the Federal taxpayer and the need for the EDC to spur redevelopment. The
EDC offers LRAs an additional tool to use in the acquisition of former military base property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When should an EDC be used?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA) of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484) and airport public benefit authorities
(49 U.S.C. 47151&hyph;47153) allow for public benefit transfers to units of government or non-profit institutions
that maintain the use of property for a public purpose including, but not limited to, parks, public health, education,
aviation, historic monuments, and prisons. Transfers of property under public benefit transfers must be in accordance
with the sponsoring Federal agency regulations. The FPASA also allows for negotiated sales at fair market value to
public entities for public purposes or direct sales through a public bid process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EDC should be used when the LRA wants to obtain property for job generating purposes and it is not practicable to
pay fair market value at the time of transfer. However, the EDC is not intended to supplant other Federal property disposal
authorities and cannot be used if the intended land use can be accomplished through another authority unless unusual
circumstances are presented that demonstrate that the needed economic development and job generation cannot occur
under the other allowable federal transfer authority.

1Public benefit and other specific conveyances are typically either approved or sponsored by the authorized Federal
agency. In approved transfers, the Federal agency must grant its approval but property conveyance is accomplished
by the Military Department. In sponsored transfers, the Military Department assigns the property to the Federal
agency, upon request, and the Federal agency is responsible for conveyance of the property to its recipient.

&bull;Who Can Receive an Economic Development Conveyance?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An LRA is the only entity eligible to receive property under an Economic Development Conveyance. An LRA should have
broad-based membership, including, but not limited to, representatives from those jurisdictions with zoning authority
over the property. The Secretary of Defense shall officially recognize an LRA for planning and/or implementation
through the Office of Economic Adjustment. Consequently, applications submitted by entities other than LRAs will
not be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When should an application for an Economic Development Conveyance be made?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, an LRA must be organized and a redevelopment plan created. The Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment
can provide guidance and technical and financial support in these efforts. Once a redevelopment plan has been developed
and adopted, the LRA can then submit an EDC application to the Military Department responsible for the property. The
application should be submitted by the LRA after consultation with the Military Department which shall establish
a reasonable time period for submission of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LRA always has the option of acquiring property under the FPASA and thus it may not be necessary to complete an application
for an EDC within the stated timetables. LRAs can discuss the various transfer options with the Military Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How much property should be included in an Economic Development Conveyance application?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EDC should be used by LRAs to obtain large parcels of the base rather than merely individual buildings. The income
received from some of the higher value property should be used to offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the
less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide
an income stream to assist the long-term development of the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Why is an application necessary?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Amendment to the interim final rule prescribes that an application be prepared by an LRA as the formal request
for property, to better assist the Military Department in considering requests for property under the Economic Development
Conveyance (EDC). This information also will provide the basis for the Military Department to respond to its obligations
under Title XXIX, taking into account the best community-based information on the proposed conveyance action. A
great deal of information necessary for an application is readily available to the LRA through the community planning
process and supported through existing DoD technical and financial resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Beyond the standard planning information collected to date, LRAs should incorporate a business and development
component into their overall base reuse planning process as a basis for receiving and managing the real property.
This supplemental effort will assist LRAs in identifying necessary implementation resources and establish a community-based
proposal for the Military Department's consideration. The Military Departments and the Office of Economic Adjustment
will continue to work closely with the affected LRA to ensure that an adequate planning effort is undertaken.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After receipt of an application for an EDC, the Secretary of the Military Department will determine whether an EDC
is appropriate to spur economic development and job creation and examine whether the terms and conditions proposed
are fair and reasonable. The Military Department may also consider information independent of the application,
such as views of other Federal agencies, appraisals, caretaker costs and other relevant information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following criteria and factors will be used, as appropriate, to determine whether a community is eligible for
an EDC and to evaluate the proposed terms and conditions of the EDC, including price, time of payment and other relevant
methods of compensation to the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Adverse economic impact of closure on the region and potential for economic recovery after an EDC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Extent of short- and long-term job generation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consistency with the overall Redevelopment Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Financial feasibility of the development, including market analysis and the need and extent of proposed infrastructure
investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Extent of State and local investment and level of risk incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Current local and regional real estate market conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incorporation of other Federal agency interests and concerns, and applicability of, and conflicts with,
other Federal property disposal authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Relationship to the overall Military Department disposal plan for the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Economic benefit to the Federal Government, including protection and maintenance cost savings and anticipated
consideration from the transfer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What are the guidelines for determining the terms and conditions of consideration?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The individual circumstances of each community and each base mean that the amount and type of consideration
may vary from base to base. This amendment gives greater discretion and flexibility to the Military Departments to
negotiate with the LRA to arrive at an appropriate arrangement. Due to the circumstances of a particular site, the
base's value may be high or low, and the range of the estimated present fair market value may be broad or narrow. Where
there is value, the Department of Defense has an obligation under Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization
Act for FY 1994 to obtain consideration within the estimated range of present fair market value, or to justify why such
consideration was not realized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Taking into account all information provided in the EDC application and any additional information considered
relevant, the Military Department will contract for or prepare an estimate of the fair market value of the property,
which may be expressed as a range of values. The Military Department shall consult with the LRA on valuation assumptions,
guidelines and on instructions given to the person(s) making the estimation of value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As stated above, the EDC application must contain a statement that proposes general terms and conditions of
the conveyance, as well as the amount and type of the consideration, a payment schedule, and projected date of conveyance.
After reviewing the application, the Military Department has the discretion and flexibility to enter into one of
two types of agreements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consideration within the estimated range of present fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Military
Department. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Military Department can be flexible about the terms and conditions of payment, and can provide financing on the
property. The payment can be in cash or in-kind, and can be paid at time of transfer or at a time in the future. The Military
Departments will have the discretion and flexibility to enter into agreements that specify the form and amount of
consideration and ensures that consideration is within the estimated range of fair market value at the time of application.
Such methods of payment could include: participation in the gross or net cash flow, deferred payments, mortgages
or other financing arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consideration below the estimated range of fair market value, where proper justification is provided.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a discount is found by the Secretary of the Military Department to be necessary to foster local economic redevelopment
and job creation, the amount of consideration can be below the estimated range of fair market value. Again, the terms
and conditions of payment will be negotiated between the Military Department and the LRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Justification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proper justification for a discount shall be based upon the findings in the business and development plan contained
in the EDC application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development economics, including absorption schedules and legitimate infrastructure costs, would provide a basis
for such justification. The ability to pay at time of conveyance or to obtain financing would not be a proper justification,
since payment terms and conditions can be negotiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In negotiating the terms and conditions of consideration with the LRA, the Secretary of the Military Department
must determine that a fair and reasonable compensation to the Federal Government will be realized from the EDC. Where
property is transferred under an EDC at an amount less than the estimated range of fair market value, the Military Department
shall prepare a written explanation of why the consideration was less than the estimated range of present fair market
value.

Economic Development Conveyances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 2903 of Public Law 103&hyph;160 gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer property to local
redevelopment authorities for consideration in cash or in kind, with or without initial payment or with only partial
payment at time of transfer, at or below the estimated fair market value of the property. This authority creates an
additional tool for local communities to help spur economic opportunity through a new real property conveyance method
specifically designed for economic development, referred to as the ``Economic Development Conveyance'' (EDC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The EDC should only be used when other Federal property disposal authorities for the intended land use cannot be
used to accomplish the necessary economic redevelopment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Before making an EDC, the Military Department must prepare an estimate of the present fair market value of the property,
which may be expressed as a range of values. The Military Department shall consult with the Local Redevelopment Authority
on valuation assumptions, guidelines and on instructions given to the person(s) making the estimation of value,
but shall be fully responsible for completion of the valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) is the only entity able to receive property under an Economic Development
Conveyance. An LRA should have broad-based membership, including, but not limited to representatives from those
jurisdictions with zoning authority over the property. The Secretary of Defense shall officially recognize an LRA
for planning and/or implementation through the Office of Economic Adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A properly completed application will be the basis for a decision on whether an LRA will be eligible for an Economic
Development Conveyance. An application should be submitted by the LRA after a Redevelopment Plan is adopted by the
LRA. The Secretary of the Military Departments shall establish a reasonable time period for submission of the EDC
application after consultation with the LRA. The Services will review the applications and make a decision whether
to make an EDC based on the criteria specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. The terms and conditions of the EDC
will be negotiated between the Military Departments and the LRA. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed with no consideration
if they meet the standards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The application should explain why an EDC is necessary for economic redevelopment and job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the elements in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, after Military Department review of the application,
additional information may be requested to allow for a better evaluation of the application. The application should
contain the following elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

, the Secretary of the Military Department will review the application for an EDC and negotiate the terms and conditions
of each transaction with the LRA. The Military Departments will have the discretion and flexibility to enter into
agreements that specify the form, amount, and payment schedule. The consideration may be at or below the estimated
fair market value, with or without initial payment, in cash or in-kind and paid over time. An EDC must be one of the two
following types of agreements:

(i) Consideration within the estimated range of present fair market value, as determined by the Secretary of the Military
Department. Payments must be made to ensure consideration is within the estimated range of fair market value at the
time of application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consideration can be below the estimated range of fair market value, when proper justification is provided.
The amount of consideration can be below the estimated range of fair market value, if the Secretary of the Military
Department determines that a discount is necessary for economic redevelopment and job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount of consideration paid in the future shall equal the present value of the agreed-upon fair market value
or discounted fair market value. Additional provisions may be incorporated in the conveyance documents to protect
the Department's interest in obtaining the agreed upon consideration. Also, the standard GSA excess profits clause,
appropriately tailored to the transaction, will be used in the conveyance documents to the LRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In a rural area, as defined by this rule, any EDC approved by the Secretary of the Military Department shall be made
without consideration when the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the communities
in the vicinity of the installation and on the prospect for their economic recovery. The Secretary of the Military
Department concerned will determine if these two conditions are met based on all the information considered in the
application for an Economic Development Conveyance. Specific attention will be placed on the business and development
plan submitted as part of the EDC application and the criteria listed in section 91.7(e)(8) will be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In those instances in which an EDC is made for consideration below the range of the estimated present fair market
value of the property_or if the estimated fair market value is expressed as a range of values, below the lowest value
in that range_the Military Department shall prepare a written explanation why the estimated fair market value was
not obtained. Additionally, the Military Departments must prepare a written statement explaining why other Federal
property transfer authorities could not be used to generate economic redevelopment and job creation.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to an adverse comment, EPA is removing the approval of a marginal nonattainment area state implementation plan
(SIP) revision for Memphis/Shelby County, Tennessee, submitted by the State of Tennessee for the purpose of bringing
about attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. The original action was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 4, 1994, as a direct final rule. 59 FR 39692. As stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
document, if adverse or critical comments were received by September 6, 1994, the effective date would be delayed
and timely notice would be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, due to receiving an adverse comment within the comment period, EPA is removing amendments relating to
the SIP revision for Memphis/Shelby County, TN, in the final rule and will address all public comments received in
a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule also published on August 4, 1994. 59 FR 39715. EPA will not institute
a second comment period on this document.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing a notice and request for data regarding issues concerning
the Clean Water Act section 311 (as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990) requirements for facility response plan
preparation as applied to non-transportation-related, onshore facilities that handle, store, or transport animal
fats and vegetable oils. This notice is, in part, in response to a Petition for reconsideration of EPA's final facility
response plan rule (Final Rule), (59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994), submitted to EPA by seven agricultural organizations.
The Petition asserts that EPA does not adequately treat these oils differently from petroleum and toxic non-petroleum
oils in the Final Rule. In support of their Petition, these organizations rely on studies that draw several conclusions
concerning the physical, toxicological, and chemical properties of animal fats and vegetable oils compared with
other types of oil. This notice summarizes the Petition, and asks for data and comment to assist EPA in determining
whether and how the differences in properties of various oils warrant further different treatment, including possibly
creating separate facility response plan regulatory regimes for these oils beyond the regime established in the
July 1, 1994 Final Rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1994, EPA published its Final Rule amending the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation (40 CFR part 112) to
incorporate new requirements to implement section 4202(a)(6) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), amending section
311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). (See 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5).) (Oil Pollution Prevention; Non-Transportation-Related
Onshore Facilities; Final Rule, 59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994.) The Final Rule directs certain facility owners and operators
to prepare plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. Under
authority of section 311(j)(1)(C) of the CWA, the Final Rule requires planning for a small and medium discharge of
oil, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4202(a)(6) of the OPA, these planning requirements apply to owners and operators of all offshore facilities
and any onshore facility that, ``because of its location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm
to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic
zone.'' OPA directs owners and operators of these facilities to prepare a plan for responding ``to the maximum extent
practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance.''
The July 1, 1994, Final Rule establishes requirements for plans for responding to discharges of oil from certain onshore
facilities within EPA's jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA published the proposed facility response plan rule on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8824). One of the issues on which
the Agency received comment was whether EPA should establish separate response plan requirements and selection
criteria for owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils. Among other
things, some commenters argued that fundamental chemical and physical differences between petroleum and non-petroleum
oils indicate the necessity for different response techniques and equipment. At least two comments on the proposed
rule asserted that lack of toxicity was a property distinguishing some non-petroleum oils both from petroleum and
other non-petroleum oils. (See letters commenting on the February 17, 1993, proposed rule from the National Renderers
Association [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;1248]; and on behalf of the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners
Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the Institute of Shortening &amp; Edible Oils, the National
Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association,
[SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;L34].) The letter on behalf of the seven agricultural organizations [SPCC&hyph;2P&hyph;2&hyph;L34]
asked EPA to ``provide for a different approach to response and removal methodologies for these substances than that
required for petroleum oil.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Final Rule for non-transportation-related facility response plans provides a strategy for petroleum oils
and non-petroleum oils that gives a considerably greater degree of flexibility to owners and operators of non-petroleum
oil facilities than to owners and operators of petroleum oil facilities in designing their plans. The Petitioners
contend that EPA should avoid treating the category animal fats and vegetable oils with the category toxic, non-petroleum
oils. EPA addressed the likely differences in responding to petroleum oil as opposed to non-petroleum oil, and created
an approach that allows owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils flexibility
to determine appropriate response equipment levels within the framework established by the regulation (See Section
7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112). The Agency provided further flexibility by allowing the Regional Administrators
(RA) to assess the adequacy of response plans including those for non-petroleum facilities, recognizing the greater
knowledge RAs have about facilities and geographic-specific environmental areas within their Regions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's approach for the identification of response resources for non-petroleum oil facilities is adapted from, and
consistent with, the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) interim final rule establishing response plan requirements under
the OPA for owners and operators of marine-transportation-related, non-petroleum oil facilities. (See 33 CFR part
154. The docket includes a chart comparing USCG plan resource requirements for petroleum and non-petroleum oil facilities,
and referencing the applicable sections of the USCG facility response plan rule.) As with the USCG Interim Final Rule,
the EPA approach gives these facility owners and operators substantial latitude in calculating required response
resources for their non-petroleum facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate resources for non-petroleum oil facilities, an owner or operator is not limited to using emulsification
or evaporation factors in Appendix E (the Equipment Appendix) of the Final Rule, as required for petroleum oil facilities.
Rather, these owners and operators must: (1) show procedures and strategies for responding to the maximum extent
practicable to a worst case discharge; (2) show sources of equipment and supplies necessary to locate, recover, and
mitigate discharges; (3) demonstrate that the equipment identified in the plan will work under the conditions and
in the areas that the plan covers, and reach the area within required times; and (4) ensure the availability of required
resources by contract or other approved means. EPA does not prescribe the type and amount of equipment that response
plans for non-petroleum oil discharges must identify (See Section 7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Final Rule is consistent with the CWA section 311(j)(5) (as amended by section 4202(a) of the OPA), which requires
facility response plans to ``remove to the maximum extent practicable'' a worst case discharge of oil or a hazardous
substance. In many responses to discharges of oil, response personnel may need to employ containment boom, skimmers,
or other equipment to contain oil and remove oil from water. Responders also may employ other strategies appropriate
for the area. These strategies apply to all oils and do not distinguish among types of oil (i.e., petroleum and non-petroleum
or toxic and non-toxic oils). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As EPA stated in the Final Rule (59 FR 34088), when results from research on such factors as emulsification or evaporation
of non-petroleum oil are available, the Agency may change the rule regarding the type of response resources for which
an owner or operator of a non-petroleum oil facility must plan.

II. The Organizations' Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a letter dated August 12, 1994, EPA received a ``Petition for Reconsideration and Stay of Effective Date'' of the
OPA-mandated facility response plan Final Rule as that rule applies to facilities that handle, store, or transport
animal fat or vegetable oils. The Petition was submitted on behalf of seven agricultural organizations (``the Organizations''
or ``Petitioners''): the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, the National Corn Growers
Association, the Institute of Shortening &amp; Edible Oils, the National Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed
Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support their Petition, the Organizations reference an industry-sponsored study titled ``Environmental Effects
of Release of Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils to Waterways'' (prepared by ENVIRON Corporation, June 28, 1993) and an
associated study titled ``Diesel Fuel, Beef Tallow, RBD Soybean Oil and Crude Soybean Oil: Acute Effects on the Fathead
Minnow, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pimephales Promelas''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (prepared by Aqua Survey, Inc., May 21, 1993). Both of these studies had been submitted to EPA during the facility response
plan rulemaking as enclosures to a comment filed over nine months after the close of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ENVIRON study concludes that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are significantly different from petroleum oils
in their effects on the aquatic environment and so merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.'' Among
other things, ENVIRON concludes that ``animal fat and vegetable oils are orders of magnitude less toxic than petroleum
oils to aquatic life;'' that ``there are no accumulating or otherwise harmful components in animal fats and vegetable
oils that are irritating, toxic or carcinogenic;'' and that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are easily biodegraded
by bacteria using them as food.'' The study also concludes that these oils can coat aquatic biota and foul wildlife,
causing hypothermia when fur or feathers mat; and that these oils have a high ``Biological Oxygen Demand'' (or BOD),
which may result in oxygen deprivation where there is a large spill in a confined body of water with a low flow and low
dilution rate. The ENVIRON study's ultimate conclusion is that animal fats and vegetable oils are sufficiently different
from petroleum oils and other hazardous materials that they merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Aqua Survey, Inc. study presents the results of Aqua Survey's tests of the acute toxicity of the test substances
on the Fathead minnow at five concentrations of each test substance. Based on the study results, the Organizations
assert that animal fats and vegetable oils_unlike petroleum-based oil and toxic non-petroleum oils_``are non-toxic,
readily biodegradable, not persistent in the environment, and, in fact, are essential components of human and wildlife
diet.''

Based, in part, on these studies, the Petitioners ask EPA to create a regulatory regime for response planning for non-petroleum,
``non-toxic'' oils separate from the regime established for petroleum oils and ``toxic,'' non-petroleum oils.
The Petitioners further submitted, as an Appendix to their Petition, specific suggested language to amend the July
1, 1994, facility response plan rule to allow mechanical dispersal and ``no action'' options for responding to a spill
of animal fats and vegetable oils.

III. Addressing Issues Presented in the ENVIRON and Aqua Survey Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA acknowledged in the Final Rule that response strategies for petroleum and non-petroleum oils may differ (59 FR
34088). However, because the Agency was aware of little data to support developing a separate regulatory regime for
non-petroleum oils and because the OPA calls for resources to remove ``oil'' (broadly defined in section 311 of the
Clean Water Act), the Agency adopted the regime described in the Final Rule (see 59 FR 3470 at 34087, 34088) and summarized
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) took issue with many statements in the ENVIRON Report in a letter to the Research
and Special Projects Administration (U.S. Department of Transportation). (See Letter from Michael J. Spear, Assistant
Director, Ecological Services, FWS to Ms. Ana Sol Gutierrez, Research and Special Projects Administration, U.S.
Department of Transportation, April 11, 1994.) The FWS expressed concern with ENVIRON statements suggesting that
edible oils and fats pose no real risk to fish and wildlife. FWS states that although petroleum oils may pose greater
risks than vegetable oils for acute toxicity to fish and wildlife from ingestion and inhalation of petroleum oil's
hydrocarbon component, both types of oil pose chronic effects from the fouling of coats and plumage in wildlife, which
often leads to death. FWS also stated that in some circumstances, edible oils can persist in the environment for extended
periods of time, forming mat and encrustation similar to petroleum products, potentially causing chronic adverse
effects to fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA also has evaluated the effects on the environment of spilled non-petroleum oils, including coconut, corn, cottonseed,
fish, and palm oils. (See a Memorandum for the Record, date June 3, 1993, from NOAA Hazardous Materials Response and
Assessment Division.) The NOAA assessment, based on literature research, addresses physical and chemical properties
and toxicity of these and other oils, and indicates that some edible oils, when spilled, may have adverse environmental
effects. Some of these effects seem to contradict conclusions in the ENVIRON study. According to NOAA, coconut and
palm oils are very viscous; in most coastal waters, these oils probably would persist for over a decade. By contrast,
ENVIRON concluded that animal fats and vegetable oils ``are easily biodegraded by bacteria,'' and that the physical
impacts of non-recoverable animal fats and vegetable oils ``would be of limited duration.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research (TSBR) made a statement on the ENVIRON study in response to a request for comment
from the Department of the Interior. (TSBR provides contingency planning, training workshops, and emergency response
for wildlife affected by oil spills.) A summary of the TSBR statement was published in its ``Wildlife &amp; Oil Spills.''
(See Vol. 4, No. 1-Winter/Spring 1994.) In the summary, TSBR makes the following observation: ``While edible oils
do not contain the toxic components of many of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons, they do have many of the same physical
properties as petroleum oils; the animals and birds will suffer the same physical effects from edible oils as they
would from contamination with petroleum products.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the studies reviewed by USCG (for the USCG rule referenced above) attesting to the harmful effects of non-petroleum
oils in the environment is an International Maritime Organization (IMO) study titled ``Harmful Effects on Birds
of Floating Lipophilic Substances Discharged from Ships.'' The IMO study underscores ENVIRON's findings of the
physical hazards associated with non-petroleum oil.

IV. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the differing scientific conclusions reached by the Petitioners, the FWS, and other groups and agencies,
EPA requests broader public comment on issues raised by the Petitioners. These include whether to have different
specific response approaches for releases of animal fats and vegetable oils (rather than increased flexibility),
and the effects on the environment of releases of these oils. EPA also asks for information regarding the following
specific questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What data are there on both the probability that spilled animal fats and vegetable oils will persist in the environment,
and the physical effects of these substances on wildlife and aquatic biota? To what extent do environmental factors
such as water temperature affect the physical characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils and the strategies
for cleaning up the oil?

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the ENVIRON and Aqua Survey Inc. studies imply that there is some level or concentration at which animal fats and
vegetable oils are hazardous to wildlife when ingested. Are there additional further studies, scientific papers,
or other data that bear on the issue? Are there data showing at what concentrations animal fat, vegetable oil, and other
non-toxic oils have adverse effects on animals that ingest such oils? How critical is the matter of an oil's toxicity
in determining what kind of equipment resources and strategies responders should use in containment and recovery?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also requests comment on whether there are data to demonstrate that the response approach set out in the
rule for non-petroleum oils is either unnecessary or harmful. Does spill size or location affect whether a response
can be more harmful than leaving the oil in the environment? If so, how and to what degree? Are there circumstances where
response techniques like containing and removing a discharge of animal fats and vegetable oils are more harmful than
dispersing these oils through use of chemical or mechanical dispersants? Are there effective, available, and authorized
chemical dispersants that responders can use for discharged animal fats and vegetable oils? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there data on emulsification and evaporation factors for non-petroleum oils that EPA can use to determine whether
to revise the facility response plan rule for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils, including
animal fats and vegetable oils? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Is there research in-progress or planned research on the issues raised in this notice?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review and evaluation of the public comments on this notice, EPA will decide whether data support creating a
new facility response plan regulatory regime for facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils
which Petitioners assert are non-toxic. EPA's determination may take the form of no further action, guidance, or
some other regulatory action.

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38151), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big
Horn Ave., Cody, WY 82414, had requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from
the requirement of a tolerance for acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, FD &amp; C Yelow No. 6 aluminum lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole
and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as components of ear tags and similar slow-release
devices in pesticide formulations applied to animals. The proposal was a reissuance of the original proposal that
appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), and responded to a comment by including a revised calculation of lifetime risk from
exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 of October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41238), which announced that Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, had submitted a pesticide tolerance petition (PP 8F3689), and a food/feed additive
petition (FAP 8H5567) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to sections 408(d) and 409 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish a tolerance for the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum
tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in or on pome fruit at 10 ppm and pome fruit juice and pome fruit pomace (wet and dry) at 12
ppm, respectively. Subsequently, the Agency reviewed an apple-processing study and concluded that section 409
tolerances for pome fruit juice and pome fruit pomace were unnecessary, and the food/feed additive petition was withdrawn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 2, 1983 (48 FR 50532), carcinogenic effects were noted in the rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study.
In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000,
and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day). The 40,000 ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after
2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000
mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this
study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at
this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level
of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level
was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined)
at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in
surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently
confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia
in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats.

In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs
concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and
classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity
in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined
that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary
bladder) in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of
1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging
from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity
classification of fosetyl-Al due to a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association
between the presence of uroliths in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats.
The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines.
Based on a mechanistic evaluation of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses in the bladder
of male rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract
toxicity that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and
occupational exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors
(stone formation and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses,
under conditions not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal
use of fosetyl-Al is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach
of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year
dog feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established
and proposed tolerances is 0.058818 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population.
For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, nonnursing infants, the TMRC is 0.130051 mg/kg
bwt/day and utilizes 4 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate),
in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit vegetables group, dried
hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple forage and fodder,
and strawberries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable
expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock or poultry as a result of this use
on pome fruit. Based on an apple-processing study, a concentration of fosetyl-Al into process fractions did not occur
and food/feed additive tolerances are not needed in conjunction with these uses on pome fruit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the
long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office
location and telephone number: Rm. 242, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703-305-4432).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 of November 2, 1983 (48 FR 50532), carcinogenic effects were noted in the rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study.
In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000, and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day).
The 40,000 ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after 2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur
and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this
study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at
this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level
of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level
was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined)
at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in
surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently
confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia
in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats.

In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs
concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and
classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity
in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined
that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary
bladder) in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of
1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging
from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity
classification of fosetyl-Al due to a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association
between the presence of uroliths in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats.
The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines.
Based on a mechanistic evaluation of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses in the bladder
of male rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract
toxicity that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and
occupational exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors
(stone formation and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses,
under conditions not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal
use of fosetyl-Al is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach
of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year
dog feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established
and proposed tolerances is 0.058818 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population.
For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, nonnursing infants, the TMRC is 0.130051 mg/kg
bwt/day and utilizes 4 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(

-ethylphosphonate), in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit vegetables
group, dried hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple forage
and fodder, and strawberries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable
expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock or poultry as a result of this use
on tomatoes. Based on a tomato-processing study, concentration of fosetyl-Al into process fractions did not occur
and food/feed additive tolerances are not needed in conjunction with this use on tomatoes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the
long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office
location and telephone number: Rm. 242, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-4432.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document modifies the uses and categories of exemptions included in the recent regulation establishing an exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 25153-40-6)
and methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer calcium sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386-95-2) in order to correctly
list the exemptions and uses for these polymers. EPA is establishing exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of these polymers when used as inert ingredients (dispersants, seed-coating adhesives) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops and raw agricultural commodities after harvest. International Specialty
Products requested this regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43526), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products
(ISP), 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, had submitted petitions (PPs 3E4260 and 3E4261) to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend
40 CFR 180.1001(c) and (e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of methyl
vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (CAS Reg No. 25153-40-6) and methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer calcium
sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386-95-2) when used as inert ingredients (dispersants, seed-coating adhesives) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops, raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or animals. For simplicity,
the exemption from tolerance under 40 CFR 180.1001(c) was requested for the seed-coating adhesive use, which is only
applicable to growing crops, as well as the dispersant use, which could include post-harvest uses. The exemption
from tolerance under 40 CFR 180.1001(e) would apply to the use of the inerts as dispersants in formulations applied
to animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemptions will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemptions are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Florida has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between
July 1, 1987, and June 30, 1990, otherwise known as HSWA Cluster II. These requirements are listed in Section B of this
notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision, subject
to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions.
Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous
waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616,
November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent
instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option
receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and
later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908,
January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III,
IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program
revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program
revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written
comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until November 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of Florida's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations
indicated in the Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective December 27, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice
containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision.

C. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Florida's application for these program revisions meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this Notice. Florida also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Florida's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is amending the rules that require a radar-observer endorsement. The amended rules will require radar-training
for licensed masters, mates, and operators of radar-equipped uninspected towing vessels 8 meters (approximately
26 feet) or more in length, either toward an endorsement or, in the short run, toward a certificate. The amended rules
are necessary to ensure that vessels equipped with radar are manned by mariners with the skills and knowledge to operate
them.

Regulatory Information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is being published as an interim rule and will be effective on November 25, 1994. The Coast Guard has determined
that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay publication of this rule, which applies current statutory
law [46 U.S.C. 2103, 7101, and 8904(a)], establishes an overdue regulatory requirement at a minimal cost, and shows
great potential for improving public safety. For these good reasons, the Coast Guard finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)
that no public notice is necessary.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, a passenger train, on September 22, 1993, with extensive injury and loss
of life, resulted in a study entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This study, based on an investigation conducted jointly by the Offices of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services
(G&hyph;N) and of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (G&hyph;M), provided the Commandant of
the Coast Guard with a number of recommendations to enhance safety in the towing industry. One of these recommendations
called for a regulatory project to amend 46 CFR parts 10 and 15 to require radar-observer training and endorsements
for operators of radar-equipped towing vessels more than 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) in length. The Commandant
concurred, and directed the Merchant Vessel Personnel Division (G&hyph;MVP) to initiate the project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule amends the current rules in two basic ways. First, it adds to 46 CFR part 15 language that extends the
requirement of a radar-observer endorsement to licensed operators of radar-equipped towboats 8 meters (approximately
26 feet) or more in length. Second, it adds to part 10 two courses: A Radar-Observer (Rivers) course and a Radar-Operation
course, the latter temporary. Because operators with unlimited and inland-waters endorsements may navigate on
rivers, the Coast Guard also found it necessary to add rivers-related topics to the list of subjects for the courses
encompassing broader routes. (``River'' means any river, canal, or similar body of water designated by the Officer
in Charge, Marine Inspection; ``Inland Waters'' means the navigable waters of the United States shoreward of the
Boundary Lines as described by 46 CFR part 7, excluding the Great Lakes [46 CFR 10.103].)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide a reasonable opportunity for affected personnel to complete full radar-observer courses and obtain radar-observer
endorsements, this interim rule requires these courses and endorsements only of personnel receiving original licenses,
renewing licenses, or upgrading licenses, on or after February 15, 1995. (Since licenses are valid for five years,
some OUTVs will not have to complete these courses until January, 2000.) However, because of the urgent need to improve
safety, this rule requires the Radar-Operation course of all affected personnel not yet required to hold the radar-observer
endorsement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the large number of personnel required to attend radar-training by February 15, 1995, and the importance
of their getting basic training as soon as possible, the Radar-Operation course may be conducted by individuals,
companies, or other organizations without prior approval of the Coast Guard. However, offerors must state on their
course-completion certificates that the courses conform to rules of the Coast Guard. Each such certificate is valid
until the holder's license is renewed or upgraded, whichever occurs first. By then, a holder of this certificate must
have completed an approved radar-observer course to obtain the endorsement on his or her license. No mariner who renews
or upgrades his or her license on or after February 15, 1995, without having attended a radar-observer course, may
serve as the master, mate, operator, or pilot of any vessel identified by 46 CFR 15.815_among which are radar-equipped
uninspected towing vessels of at least 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) in length.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radar-observer endorsement on a license expires after five years. To renew, an applicant must present a certificate
of training from an approved course: radar-observer renewal or original. Like the original course, the renewal course
will contain two principal components: a demonstration of skills on a radar simulator, and a radar-theory examination.
Any applicant successfully completing the appropriate approved course and presenting the certificate of training
to the OCMI may have his or her endorsement renewed.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review,'' and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order.
It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is nonsignificant under the Regulatory
Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11040 (February 26, 1979)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements announced by this rule will apply to licensed operators of radar-equipped towing vessels 8 meters
(approximately 26 feet) or more in length operating in U.S. waters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph
10e of the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 12,300 licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTV) in the U.S. Although some may operate
towboats on ocean (domestic-trade) waters, many of those vessels are manned by licensed masters or mates. OUTVs on
ocean waters already must complete radar-observer courses [see 46 CFR 10.464(e)(2)], but they must do this only once.
This rule will require certain licensed OUTVs to obtain radar-observer endorsements, which must be renewed five
years after the month of issue [see 46 CFR 10.480(f), below]. Roughly 15,000 masters, mates, and OUTVs will each need
to complete a radar-observer course or a Radar-Operation course sometime during the five years after the effective
date of this rule to comply with 46 CFR 15.815(c), below. Those completing the radar-observer course will need to renew
their endorsements every five years to continue to work on radar-equipped towboats of at least 8 meters (approximately
26 feet) in length. Certificates from Radar-Operation courses will not be valid with licenses dated after February
15, 1995. Consequently, persons using the Radar-Operation certificate to satisfy 46 CFR 15.815(c) will need to complete
radar-observer courses when they renew or upgrade their licenses_if they intend to continue working on radar-equipped
towboats of 8 meters (approximately 26 feet) or more in length. A Radar-Operation course, at least four hours in length,
is designed to indoctrinate operators with regard to basic uses and interpretation of radar. Radar-observer courses,
courses approved by the Coast Guard and completed by applicants seeking radar-observer endorsements on their licenses,
range in length from four hours (renewal only) to five or more days. The radar-observer courses and corresponding
endorsements are separated by area of operation: Rivers, Inland Waters, and Unlimited (any waters). Expenses to
complete the different courses will vary, depending on the courses selected, the sources of training, and the applicants'
abilities. In-house courses should cost less than courses offered by independent schools. Unless their employers
offer the courses, OUTVs likely will bear the expense for the training, and complete it on their own time. Tuition might
cost up to $100.00 a day, and miscellaneous expenses for travel, meals, and lodging will sometimes accrue too, at $20.00
to $100.00 a day. Since the endorsement is valid for five years, the expense may be spread over five years as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the typical OUTV completes a Radar-Operation course before February 15, 1995, for $50.00 and then
two years later, when renewing his or her license, completes a Radar-Observer (Rivers) course at a cost of $480.00
(three days of training, lodging, meals, and miscellaneous expenses), the expense for the first seven years will
be about $530.00, or $76.00 a year. For subsequent five-year intervals, the expense will fall to about $14.00 a year,
due to the shorter length of the renewal course ($50.00 tuition + $20.00 miscellaneous expenses = $70.00 divided by
five years = $14.00). Hence, over 30 years, training 15,000 licensed individuals will cost about $440,000.00 a year.
Since about 450 new OUTVs are added each year (at $480.00 each), $216,000.00 must also be added each year to arrive at
the total expense for the towing industry_$656,000.00 a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistical research has shown that American society is willing to pay $2,600,000.00 to save even just one life. Therefore,
even if only one life is saved each year by this rule, the benefit outweighs the expense by about $2,000,000.00 a year.

Small Entities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the provisions
of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, however, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule places its burden on individual OUTVs, not on their employers, which may, but need not, take it on
themselves. The Coast Guard expects that, of the employers that will take it on themselves, few if any will be small
entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no adverse economic impact on small entities.
If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have
a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment (see

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. By this Order, we amend our ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rules to provide an exemption for presentations between the Commission and the Department of Justice or Federal Trade
Commission relating to telecommunications competition matters. The rules are further amended to provide for disclosure
of any new factual information obtained by the Commission in such presentations if such information is relied on by
the Commission in the decision-making process. This exemption would not apply if the Department of Justice or Federal
Trade Commission becomes a party to the proceeding, e.g., by the filing of comments in the proceeding. Nor would it
apply if the proceeding is designated for hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We believe that this exemption will promote the public interest through the exchange of information and ideas between
the Commission and the other principal agencies responsible for promoting or ensuring competition in the telecommunications
industry. It should lead to more effective enforcement and protection of the public interest, development and application
of more consistent analytical methodologies, an improved, expedited license transfer process, and the possible
avoidance of unnecessarily duplicative efforts. At the same time, the requirement for disclosure of any factual
information relied on by the Commission will protect the rights of the parties.

 This final rule establishes escrow accounting procedures under Sections 6(g) and 10 of the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. 2605(g) and 2609 (RESPA). It establishes a nationwide standard accounting method known
as aggregate accounting. The rule requires servicers to use the aggregate accounting method for escrow accounts
involving federally related mortgage loans that are settled on or after the effective date of this rule. It provides
a three-year phase-in period for existing escrow accounts to convert to the aggregate accounting method. In addition,
the final rule establishes formats and procedures for initial and annual escrow account statements. By this rulemaking,
the Department is implementing the Section 10 amendments made in section 942 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable
Housing Act. Conforming changes are also made to appropriate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provisions in
parts 203 and 234.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2609) sets out the statutory limits
on the amounts that lenders may legally require borrowers to deposit in escrow accounts. The statutory language of
Section 10 is complex. It has been subject to increasing controversy. At times the statute uses the term ``lender''
and at other times it uses the term ``servicer.'' A lender creates a loan obligation but may or may not service the loan.
Within this rule, HUD uses the term servicer to include the lender when the lender performs the servicing function.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(a) of RESPA limits the amounts that a lender may charge a borrower at the creation of an escrow account and
during the lifetime of the account. Section 10(a)(1) sets limits on charges to a borrower when a lender creates an escrow
account. At the time the lender creates an escrow account, the lender may only charge the borrower an amount sufficient
to pay the charges respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, that are attributable to the period
from the date such payment(s) were last paid until the first full installment payment under the mortgage. In addition,
the lender may charge the borrower a cushion to cover unanticipated expenses. The statute limits the cushion to one-sixth
of the estimated total annual payments from the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(a)(2) sets limits on charges to a borrower over the rest of the lifetime of the escrow account. It provides
that a lender may charge a borrower a monthly sum equal to one-twelfth of the total annual escrow payments that the lender
reasonably anticipates paying from the account. In addition, a lender may add an amount to maintain a cushion equal
to one-sixth of the estimated total annual payments from the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(c) of RESPA requires a servicer to provide a borrower with initial and annual escrow account statements.
Section 10(d) sets forth the penalty provisions for a servicer's failure to provide the required statements. Section
6(g) of RESPA provides that if the servicer has required an escrow account, then the servicer shall make disbursement
payments for the escrow account items in a timely manner as such payments become due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, HUD had only interpreted the escrow accounting portions of Section 10 by informal opinion and one Interpretive
Rule, dated January 21, 1993 (58 FR 5520). Litigation initiated by various State Attorneys General and private class-action
plaintiffs raised serious questions about what RESPA permitted in this regard and fueled a debate about the extent
of ``overescrowing'' in the industry. The Secretary decided that HUD needed to fulfill its responsibility to protect
consumers by setting forth clear, specific guidance on escrow practices. Therefore, the Department initiated this
rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1993 (58 FR 64065), the Department published its proposed rule seeking public comments. After reviewing
the comments, the Department developed this final rule, which is consistent with the consumer-oriented approach
announced by the Secretary in the proposed rule. This final rule will:

(1) Reduce the cost of homeownership, by ensuring that funds are not held in escrow accounts in excess of the amounts
necessary to protect the lenders' interests in preserving the collateral;

(3) Provide servicers with clear, specific guidance on the requirements of Section 10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, new &sect;3500.17 set out HUD's regulations for escrow accounts subject to RESPA. The proposed
rule covered any escrow account established in connection with a federally related mortgage loan. It provided HUD's
interpretation of what was a permissible cushion and what was an overcharge to the borrower's escrow accounts. The
proposed rule articulated HUD's new policy requiring aggregate accounting analysis on all new escrow accounts.
The proposed rule set out the requirements for initial and annual escrow account statements. The rule also proposed
a delayed effective date to provide sufficient time for servicers to implement the regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When issuing the proposed rule, HUD reviewed existing escrow accounting procedures. A prevalent practice exists,
called single-item analysis, where a lender accounts for each escrow item separately. The lender may collect more
money under a single-item analysis accounting than under aggregate analysis accounting. An aggregate accounting
method is one in which the sufficiency of the funds is determined by analyzing the escrow account as a whole. Attorneys
General of numerous States have claimed that single-item analysis has resulted in substantial over-escrowing of
consumers' money. The Attorneys Generals interpreted Section 10 as requiring aggregate accounting practices to
determine the maximum account balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's own escrow study found that too many accounts were over-escrowed and too much of consumers' funds was being held
by mortgage servicers. In the proposed rule, HUD announced its determination that servicers should be required to
analyze all new escrow accounts on an aggregate accounting basis. HUD proposed to provide a three-year phase-in period
after the rule's publication date for existing accounts to be converted to an aggregate accounting methodology.
HUD requested comments on its proposed rule and received 142 comments through the February 1, 1994, due date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters specifically supported the proposed rule (two mortgage companies, one attorney, one bank, and a
government agency). Seven comments supported the rule, but with recommended clarifications or revisions. Twenty
commenters supported industry standardization. Fifteen flatly opposed the proposed rule for various reasons.
Some argued that HUD was overly interfering in escrow industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD believes that the final rule will end uncertainty that now exists within the industry. HUD is providing clear standards
for the servicing industry to follow. Congress explicitly provided HUD with regulatory authority to interpret the
Act to further its purpose. This regulation is well within HUD's rulemaking authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen commenters requested an additional comment period or the opportunity to participate in hearings. Although
the Department considered requests for additional time for comments and hearings, it concludes that it has sufficient
information to complete rulemaking without more input.

Costs of Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-four commenters (19 mortgage companies, 16 banks, 4 attorneys, 4 associations, and 1 government agency) expressed
concern about the cost of redesigning software systems to perform the aggregate analysis and to complete the required
statements. Many commenters indicated that the expense of systems design and implementation, staff training, and
additional administrative efforts would far outweigh any potential benefit provided to consumers. In reviewing
these comments, the Department balanced the short-term cost considerations against the long-term advantages of
standardized nationwide requirements for escrow accounts and consumer savings. The Department concludes that
the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs.

Phase-in and Implementation Periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provided a 180-day period for persons to implement its provisions concerning aggregate accounting
practices for new escrow accounts. Sixty-seven commenters (33 mortgage companies, 20 banks, 7 associations, 5 attorneys,
and 2 government agencies) requested that the 180-day period be extended to 12 or 18 months. They cited changes in software,
staff training, and other administrative burdens as reasons for the implementation extension. Several commenters
also stated that there would be no incentive to maintain dual systems for pre- and post-rule accounts because dual
systems would be too costly and difficult to administer. Sixteen commenters observed that if the implementation
period was extended to at least one year, the phase-in period for pre-rule activity should be eliminated. Three commenters
supporting the phase-in of pre-rule escrow accounts suggested that HUD should not require the disclosures proposed
in the rule during the phase-in period. Four commenters requested that the implementation date be extended to two
to three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While recognizing that a 180-day implementation period for new accounts is demanding, the Secretary concludes that
this rule will save consumers money and that it should be implemented as quickly as possible. Moreover, HUD alerted
the mortgage servicing and software industry in December 1993 of its intention to implement aggregate accounting
requirements. The Secretary believes the affected industries are capable of developing the necessary systems within
the 180-day implementation period. This final rule therefore carries forward the 180-day implementation period.

The Department further believes that permitting a three year phase-in period for existing accounts is appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is a fair way to apply aggregate accounting requirements to existing escrow accounts. During the three year phase-in
period, a considerable number of existing escrow accounts will likely be terminated as residential property is sold
or mortgages are refinanced and new escrow accounts established. The three-year requirement sets an appropriate
balance between sensitivity to servicer expectations regarding the price of servicing and concern that the desired
policy is implemented for consumers as quickly as reasonable. The three year phase-in period provides a specific
date when all escrow accounts are subject to aggregate accounting requirements. HUD acknowledges that servicers
may have purchased servicing rights at premiums based, among other things, on the expectation of doing single-item
accounting. However, because HUD has provided notice nearly four years in advance of the conversion date, the pricing
of servicing will adjust accordingly (if it has not already).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Until the conversion date for pre-rule accounts, both single-item (individual-item) analysis and aggregate analysis
methods are acceptable accounting methods, as are accounting methods that combine characteristics of both the foregoing
methods (sometimes termed ``hybrid accounting methods''), as long as use of any such method does not result in payments
or cushions in excess of those that result from escrow account analysis using the single-item analysis method. For
post-rule accounts, aggregate analysis is the only acceptable accounting method to conduct escrow account analysis
to ensure compliance with the limits imposed by this regulation.

Interest on Escrow Accounts and Single-Item Escrow Accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters asked whether the final rule would address interest on escrow accounts. Seven commenters suggested that
the rule specifically exempt servicers that either pay interest on escrow accounts or service only one escrow item.
These commenters believed that a required interest payment on escrow account balances would create a disincentive
to servicers to over-escrow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the Department determines that it will not create the requested exemptions. The
Department does not interpret Section 10 of RESPA as providing the Department with legal authority to require payment
of interest on escrow accounts. Where interest is required, it is a matter of State law, with fourteen States requiring
that some amount of interest be paid on escrow account funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where there is only one escrow account item in the escrow account, there is no difference in the outcome between these
two accounting methods. Nonetheless, HUD believes it appropriate for escrow accounts with only one escrow item to
conform to the rule requirements. To enhance industry standardization, HUD applies the final rule to all escrow accounts
involving a federally related mortgage loan, regardless of the number of escrow account items within the escrow account.

Termination of Escrow Accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters asked HUD to address whether a borrower could terminate his/her escrow account when the loan was paid
down to a certain amount (similar to provisions included in a proposed escrow account reform bill introduced in Congress).
The Department believes it has no authority under Section 10 to regulate when a borrower may terminate an escrow account
based on a loan-to-value ratio or otherwise. HUD encourages borrowers to turn to the mortgage documents for guidance.
Additionally, major secondary market purchasers have established standards for termination of escrow accounts.
Also, a borrower may simply ask the servicer to exercise discretion in terminating an escrow account.

Annual Escrow Account Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters requested that HUD clarify its terms or definitions to be consistent with industry terminology,
the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA), or terms used by other
Federal agencies. Thirteen commenters requested clarification of the term ``annual escrow account statement''.
Many commenters thought that the Department had commingled the requirements for the annual escrow account statement,
as set forth in NAHA, with the requirements for an annual escrow analysis. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)
recommended that ``HUD retain the definition of annual escrow account statement as defined in the proposed rule for
escrow account statements published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1991.'' (56 FR 64445.) The MBA argued that the previous definition would alleviate any confusion about
the timing of the annual escrow account statements and annual escrow analysis. In addition, the MBA stated that the
previous definition of ``annual escrow account statement'' took into account the industry practice of generally
performing escrow analyses after the largest escrow account item was paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD defines an annual escrow account statement as a statement containing the information required in &sect;3500.17(i)
that a servicer must submit to the borrower within 30 days of the end of the escrow account computation year. This definition
comports with the MBA recommendation. The comments correctly observed that the annual statements and the escrow
account analysis are ``commingled.'' HUD considers an escrow account analysis necessary to make the annual escrow
account statement meaningful. Thus, the rule clearly requires the servicer to conduct an escrow account analysis
at the end of the escrow account computation year. However, the final rule provides servicers with flexibility in
setting the escrow account computation year. HUD's rule therefore allows the industry to continue the practice of
conducting the escrow analysis after paying the largest escrow account item.

Cushion and Pre-Accrual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine commenters requested clarification of the definitions of cushion and pre-accrual. The proposed rule defined
the cushion to mean funds that a servicer could require a borrower to pay into an escrow account to cover unanticipated
disbursements or to cover disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the account. The proposed
rule defined ``pre-accrual'' to be a practice that some servicers employed under which funds needed for disbursement
from an escrow account are required to be on deposit in the account at a date prior to the disbursement date. Both terms
were subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of the section. Paragraph (c)(6) of the proposed rule prohibited
the use of pre-accrual on post-rule accounts and limited its use on pre-rule accounts to within the limits set in paragraph
(c)(4). Commenters stated that the pre-accrual disallowance language in the proposed &sect;3500.17(c)(6) effectively
modified previously allowable cushions. This was HUD's intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD received 30 comments questioning HUD's prohibition of pre-accrual practices for post-rule accounts. Many commented
that HUD had long accepted pre-accrual as a legal methodology for analyzing escrow balances. Seventeen commented
that servicers may be discouraged from establishing escrow accounts because of the increased costs and prohibitions
against pre-accrual practices. They stated that if servicers ceased handling escrow accounts, some borrowers would
be delinquent in their tax payments and the taxing authorities would experience greater administrative expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that pre-accrual practices allow servicers to acquire the equivalent of up to another month
of cushion in the escrow account. Coupled with a cushion of greater than one month, a pre-accrual practice could result
in escrow account balances that exceed RESPA's limits. HUD believes that the cushion provides sufficient extra funds
to cover unanticipated disbursements or disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the
account. Therefore, pre-accrual is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule eliminates the use of pre-accrual on all new accounts. Generally, for existing escrow accounts, a servicer
may not require any pre-accrual that exceeds one month or that results in an account balance larger than the limits
set forth in &sect;3500.17(c). In addition, the Department considered the arguments of servicers who claimed they
would discontinue handling escrow accounts under the proposed rule. The Department concludes that servicers are
unlikely to abandon the practice of handling escrow accounts.

Forty-two commenters (25 mortgage companies, 11 banks, 2 associations, 3 attorneys, and Fannie Mae) requested clarification
of the definition of disbursement date. Fannie Mae's response noted that the proposed disbursement date definition
permits the payment to occur ``*&blank;*&blank;* without regard to the lender's normal lending practice or local
custom or prudent lending practice.'' Further, several commenters suggested that the proposed definition does
not reflect that the disbursement date may be in a month or in a period prior to the month it is due, in order to take advantage
of discounts. GE Capital Mortgage Services, Inc. stated that ``although HUD may not have intended to require a disbursement
date to always be in the same calendar month as the due date, the language could be read to require this.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its proposed definition, HUD intended to define the disbursement date as the date the servicer actually pays the
escrow item. HUD intended to apply a standard that conformed with prudent lending practices to pay escrow account
items promptly and to take advantage of discounts, when available, and avoid penalties. The proposed definition
required a servicer to pay an escrow item in time to take advantage of available discounts, or at least in time to avoid
a penalty. In the final rule, HUD defines the disbursement date as the date the servicer actually pays an escrow item.
In &sect;3500.17(k), HUD provides that in calculating the disbursement date, the servicer must pay the disbursement
on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The disbursement
date may be in a month other than the due date established by the payee. In cases of payments to obtain a discount, the
disbursement date may be in a month before the payee's due date. In cases of payments to avoid a penalty, the disbursement
date may be in a month after the payee's due date, but before the penalty would be assessed.

Escrow Account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eight commenters requested clarification of the proposed ``escrow account'' definition. Commenters stated that
the final rule definition should exclude voluntarily escrowed funds. They believed that such payments should be
excluded from the trial running balance calculations of an escrow account. The Department rejects this argument.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term escrow account encompasses all escrow accounts, including those that are ``voluntarily'' agreed to by borrowers
and under the control of servicers. Because most borrowers are anxious to obtain a loan, they are likely to agree to
a lender's request for a voluntary escrow account that is under the lender's control. Arguably all escrow accounts
are voluntarily entered into when the parties agree to the mortgage loan. Thus, an exemption for servicer controlled
accounts involving ``voluntarily'' escrowed funds would nullify the statute's purpose of protecting consumers.
Therefore, the final rule provides a uniform standard for all servicers who control escrow accounts. In the final
rule, the term ``escrow account'' excludes any account that is totally under the borrower's control.

Escrow Account Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-one commenters requested clarification of the ``escrow account analysis'' definition (14 mortgage companies,
4 banks, 2 attorneys, and the MBA). These comments complained that the proposed definition of ``escrow analysis''
required that an analysis be done to prepare the initial and annual escrow account statements. The commenters viewed
these functions as completely separate. They argued against the linkage of the analysis with the preparation of the
escrow account statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered these comments but concludes that an escrow analysis is ordinarily needed to provide an
initial and annual escrow account statement. Otherwise, the statements may be meaningless. In the final rule, however,
the Department no longer requires the servicer to provide the initial escrow account statement at settlement. Section
3500.17(g) now permits servicers to submit the initial escrow account statement to the borrower within 45 calendar
days after settlement. In this way the servicer, rather than the closing agent, is likely to perform the escrow account
analysis, and the initial escrow account statement will more accurately reflect the first year's projections.

Escrow Account Computation Year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-eight commenters sought clarification of the term ``escrow account computation year'' (17 mortgage companies,
6 banks, 3 attorneys, and 2 associations). Twenty comments asked for clarification of the term ``escrow account computation
year'' as HUD used it in the definition of ``trial running balance.'' Several commenters requested that HUD revise
the final definition to be consistent with HUD's definition in an earlier proposed rule of December 9, 1991. There,
HUD defined ``escrow account computation year'' to mean ``any escrow account year whose date of establishment begins
on or after January 1, 1991.'' (56 FR 64445, &sect;3500.17(a)(1).) January 1, 1991, was the statutory initiation
date. In HUD's December 3, 1993, proposed rule, the definition of ``escrow account computation year'' is a 12-month
period starting on the initial payment date (58 FR at 64071). Several commenters argued for greater flexibility to
set the escrow account computation year, rather than have it established by the initial payment date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is aware that servicers may need to spread out their workload throughout the year. The final rule permits the servicer
to have some flexibility in setting the computation year by allowing for ``short year'' statements. In the final rule,
an escrow account computation year begins at the initial payment date. However, the servicer may use a ``short year''
statement to level its production load and reestablish an escrow account computation year that best meets its business
cycle.

Installment Payment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters requested clarification of the ``installment payment'' definition. They stated that HUD's proposed
definition lacked clarity regarding tax or insurance statements that are payable on a quarterly or semi-annual basis,
but are actually paid by the servicers annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believed the proposed definition adequately described installment payments, but has given an example
to clarify its usage in the final rule. Unless there is a discount to the borrower for early payments, the regulation
does not allow servicers to pay installment payments on an annual or other prepayment basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters suggested the definition of ``payment date'' be changed to ``payment due date'' to distinguish the
term from the disbursement date. In response to these comments, the Department uses the phrase ``payment due date''
in the final rule. These commenters also suggested that the reference to monthly payments be revised to ``periodic
payments.'' HUD makes this change when appropriate. Four commenters requested detailed guidance on escrow accounts
when payments are made biweekly or for periods other than monthly. The proposed rule did not explicitly address this
issue. It used monthly and yearly phrases because those terms follow the statute's language. The final rule, however,
provides illustrations of biweekly accounting in Appendix H.

Refinancing Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule stated that the refinancing of a pre-rule escrow account would turn it into a post-rule account.
One commenter indicated that a refinancing between the same lender and borrower should not change the account from
a pre-rule to post-rule status. Four commenters questioned whether modifications or assumptions of pre-rule escrow
accounts would result in a pre- or post-rule escrow account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Congress amended RESPA in Section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically to change
the definition of ``federally related mortgage loan'' to include ``any such secured loan, the proceeds of which are
used to prepay or pay off an existing loan secured by the same property.'' 12 U.S.C. 2602(1)(A). This amendment became
effective on October 28, 1992, its enactment date. As of December 2, 1992 (57 FR 49600), HUD's regulations withdrew
the previous exemption for refinancing transactions from RESPA coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thus, when HUD issued the proposed escrow accounting rule of December 3, 1993, refinancing transactions were covered
by RESPA. HUD issued a final rule implementing the section 908 amendments of RESPA on February 10, 1994. In that final
rule, the Department defined a refinancing to mean ``a transaction in which an existing obligation that was subject
to a secured lien on residential real property is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same
borrower and with the same or a new lender.'' (59 FR 6506, at 6512.) HUD also adopted certain Regulation Z requirements
for refinancing transactions with the same lender. This final rule uses the &sect;3500.2 definition to determine
whether a transaction is a refinancing that requires post-rule treatment. If the transaction involves only a modification
or other change to existing terms of a mortgage document, then it will remain a pre-rule account during the three-year
implementation period.

an express provision will try to circumvent the express limits on profiteering contained in the proposed rule by charging
consumers annual maintenance fees.'' In response, the Department considered whether servicers would charge borrowers
escrow account maintenance fees or document storage fees to defray lost revenue resulting from changes in accounting
practices required by this final rule. An examination of the standard Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac Uniform Instrument
(Section 2 of the Uniform Covenants) indicates that such fees are prohibited in most circumstances (except where
interest is paid on escrow accounts and state law allows such charges). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department has not seen evidence that servicers, as a common practice, currently charge maintenance or storage
fees in conjunction with escrow accounts. HUD's existing regulations for FHA insured loans already prohibit the
FHA mortgagee or servicer from charging the borrower for servicing activities. 24 CFR 203.552(a)(12)(i). If the
Department sees such fees develop with respect to any other loans to thwart the statutory and regulatory limitations,
then HUD is likely to reconsider this issue in conjunction with applicable State law provisions. At this time, the
Department intends to monitor the servicing industry carefully to insure compliance with Sections 8 and 10 of RESPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-nine comments sought guidance on how to estimate disbursement amounts for the next year. They specifically
questioned how to determine whether increases or decreases in amounts ``are known or should be known.'' They questioned
how they ``should know'' a change in the charge. Twenty-two comments supported the use of estimates based on the prior
year's actual disbursements modified by a defined CPI index. They also supported using actual increases or decreases,
if known. Nineteen comments requested more explicit guidance, specifically questioning which CPI index to use.
Five commenters requested an example of how to estimate a new payment for the ensuing escrow account computation period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In the final rule, the Department provides that if the servicer knows the charges for the subsequent escrow account
computation year, then the servicer shall use those amounts in estimating the disbursement amounts. If the charge
is unknown to the servicer, then the servicer may use an estimate based on the preceding year's charge as modified by
an amount not exceeding the most recent year's change in the national Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers
(CPI, all items). In addition, the final rule establishes procedures for estimating charges for new construction
where the land and structure are unassessed.

Provisions in Mortgage Documents

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule stated that the mortgage loan documents prevail if the documents prescribe escrow account limits
lower than those prescribed in the rule. Six commenters observed that the final rule should permit a cushion on all
escrow accounts regardless of contract provisions in the mortgage document. Twenty-five commenters indicated
that the final rule should explicitly state that a one-sixth cushion could be established when the loan documents
are silent. Many commenters were concerned that the language in the proposed rule would alter the contractual terms
between borrowers, lenders, and servicers, and they questioned inconsistencies with standard form Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA security instruments. Six comments indicated that the final rule should pronounce common
standards for contract types that address the cushions allowed under Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, and VA contracts,
using standard contract language. The joint comments from the States' Attorneys General noted that, ``while HUD's
proposed rule clearly states that where contracts provide for more restrictive cushions than the two-month aggregate
cushion, the contracts control, however the proposed rule leaves unnecessary ambiguity as to which contracts those
are, and how explicit the contract language must be in order for the contract to take precedence.'' One comment also
stated that pre-rule loan documents that violate the final rule should not have to be revised or be considered a violation
of RESPA if the servicer complies with the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The rule requires servicers to examine the mortgage loan documents to determine their escrow limits in preparing
the initial escrow account statements. If the loan document provides that an escrow account may hold amounts ``up
to the limits allowed by RESPA,'' HUD interprets this as permitting the full amount allowed by this rule. In the final
rule, the Department clearly states that if the mortgage loan documents provide for lower cushion limits or less pre-accrual
than the rule, then the documents apply. Where the mortgage documents allow payments to an escrow account in excess
of those permitted under this rule, then this final rule and the statute control. Where the mortgage documents do not
specifically establish an escrow account, whether a servicer may appropriately establish an escrow account is a
matter for determination by State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of cushion or pre-accrual limits and the servicer establishes an escrow account under State law, then this final rule
governs unless State law provides for a lower amount. A lower amount would be consistent with RESPA's maximums and
could be seen as giving greater protection to the consumer.

The proposed rule mandated aggregate account analysis for all escrow accounts established under mortgages closed
after the final rule's effective date. Thirteen comments supported this position. Twenty-eight comments opposed
a mandatory aggregate accounting method (15 banks, 7 mortgage companies, 3 associations, and 3 attorneys). Many
comments stressed that increased costs associated with aggregate analysis_redesigning software, staff training,
and additional administrative efforts_would be passed on to borrowers as either higher interest rates, higher origination
fees, or escrow management/servicing fees. They also suggested that low- and moderate-income borrowers would be
the most affected by cost increases. Four comments noted an inconsistency between HUD's rationale for requiring
aggregate accounting and the conclusions in HUD's Phase II study results published in May 1991. They suggested that
aggregate analysis could result in more overall funds being escrowed than currently result under single-item accounting.
They claimed that because a majority of servicers currently escrow below the RESPA limitations, under this final
rule they would raise their cushions to the maximum allowable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although there will be some initial costs associated with a conversion to aggregate accounting, HUD believes that
this cost is outweighed by the long-term consumer savings that will be accomplished. HUD believes that aggregate
analysis will result in lower escrow balances in the long run. Moreover, the Phase II study concluded unambiguously
that aggregate accounting results in lower escrow balances than single-item accounting with the same cushion and
pre-accrual practices. HUD acknowledges that servicers who have maintained escrow balances below RESPA's limits
may increase the accounts to the allowable maximum amounts.

The proposed rule provided an arithmetic example of an aggregate analysis computation. It also gave a detailed narrative
of the steps to use in calculating the maximum cushion. Two comments requested that Step B in the calculation be simplified
and Step C deleted. Many stated that HUD should describe the aggregate accounting method using only a narrative paragraph
and should not attempt to set out the arithmetic steps to use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others disagreed with HUD's calculations. For example, 38 commenters stated that when they determine the lowest
monthly trial balance calculations of an escrow account, they first consider disbursements (debits) before receipts
(credits). They claim that borrowers often do not make their mortgage payments until the end of a grace period. Disbursements
are often due at the first of the month. Because HUD did not consider the timing of payments and disbursements, the commenters
argued that the low-point balance may be understated. They claim this could result in shortages and deficiencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The final rule contains both narrative and arithmetic descriptions of the steps to be used in an escrow account analysis
under either method. The Department believes that it is providing useful guidance to the industry by giving both descriptions
and examples. If HUD failed to provide a step-by-step algorithm, some servicers might be uncertain about the allowable
limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To consider all disbursements before receipts is to effectively reintroduce one month pre-accrual. Under the final
rule, the escrow account analysis is a picture of the escrow account at month's end. Consequently, the timing of the
payments and disbursements within a month do not change the computations. If a servicer pays a disbursement before
the borrower makes a monthly mortgage payment, then the servicer may use the allowable cushion, if necessary.

Single-Item Analysis

Nineteen comments stated that HUD should reaffirm its past policy in support of single-item analysis method. They
argued that Section 10 of RESPA permits single-item analysis. HUD's previous informal interpretations and an opinion
of the Comptroller General supported this view. They claim that Congress did not intend aggregate analysis limits
to be imposed on escrow account balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Other comments indicated that HUD's example in Appendix F of a single-item analysis was inconsistent with the methodology
used by the majority of the industry. The commenters claimed that the industry does not use a trial running balance
to determine single-item analysis limits. The commenters expressed concern that they would have to conform their
current systems and software to the proposed single-item analysis during the phase-in period. They claimed that
this would further increase costs and the burden of compliance. Five suggested that HUD delay the implementation
of the ``new'' single-item analysis provisions for one year, to permit time to reprogram systems and train staff.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 When the Secretary issued the proposed rule, he was well aware of prior HUD interpretations concerning single-item
analysis. Through informal legal opinions, HUD allowed servicers to use single-item analysis in calculating Section
10's limitations. HUD also issued an Interpretive Rule, dated January 21, 1993, in which HUD allowed single-item
analysis within Section 10's limitations. The Interpretive Rule is effective until the effective date of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 HUD reconsidered its position on single-item accounting because HUD's Phase II report showed that aggregate accounting
would result in lower escrow balances. When RESPA was first enacted the vast majority of servicers employed single-item
analysis. The development of computer software and the increased availability of computer office equipment, however,
makes the aggregate accounting computations easier than before. The statute describes the cushion as ``one-sixth
of the estimated total amount'' of such charges. This rule represents the policy decision that aggregate accounting
shall be the new standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In reaching this decision, the Secretary has seriously considered the countervailing interests. Servicers have
had the benefit of greater escrow account balances under a single-item analysis accounting than they would have had
if an aggregate analysis were employed. On the other hand, borrowers have had more money tied up in escrow accounts
under a single-item accounting practice than would have been the case if aggregate accounting were practiced. Because
the application of single-item analysis almost always means that servicers collect more money from borrowers than
would be the case if the account were computed on an aggregate basis, the final rule requires an aggregate analysis
prospectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 During the three-year phase-in period, servicers may still use single-item analysis for pre-rule accounts. The
proposed rule contained a description and an illustration of single-item analysis that some commenters argued inaccurately
described their practices. HUD does not intend for servicers to develop new single-item analysis systems. However,
any application of single-item analysis must be within Section 10's limits as interpreted by this rule in &sect;3500.17(d)(2).
As long as servicers are within these limits, they may use a single-item accounting procedure on pre-rule accounts
for three years from the publication date of this rule.

Four comments noted that the HUD settlement statements currently use single-item analysis at closing. They raised
questions concerning the proper procedures for collecting the cushion at settlement after the effective date of
this rule. Some commenters were concerned that aggregate accounting at settlement could cause confusion if that
method replaced the relatively simple method of adding a two-month cushion to the amounts due by the initial payment
date. Several commenters suggested that single-item analysis be permitted at closing and aggregate analysis be
used for all post-closing escrow activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In consideration of these concerns, HUD is offering two alternative methods for completing the HUD settlement statements
during a phase-in period ending three years from the date of publication of this rule. However, one of the Department's
goals in this rule is to reduce the amount borrowers must pay at closing into escrow accounts. HUD intends to implement
this goal by requiring aggregate accounting practices at closing. The Department intends to make computer software
available to interested persons to help make the necessary calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Under the first of the 2 methods permitted during the phase-in period, the settlement agent may use an aggregate accounting
method to adjust the initial entries on the last line of the 1000 series on the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement
statement. The Department anticipates that software and implementation materials will be generally available
to settlement agents by the effective date of this rule. Alternatively, during the phase-in period the settlement
agent may initially calculate the deposits using a single-item analysis approach, but with only a one-month cushion.
HUD's studies indicate that a one-month cushion roughly yields the equivalent aggregate accounting result. This
option is available only where aggregate accounting is not performed as part of the closing process. The final rule
permits the servicer to provide the initial escrow account statement within 45 days of closing, and the servicer shall
then adjust the escrow account at that time to an aggregate accounting calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal Reserve Board also was concerned about how lenders would calculate the amount for the mortgage insurance
premium cushion in making a Truth in Lending disclosure of the annual percentage rate. HUD consulted with Federal
Reserve Board officials, who indicated that the Federal Reserve Board will issue, in conjunction with the issuance
of this final rule, clarifying instructions for lenders and servicers to use in completing the HUD settlement statements
and in computing the annual percentage rate. Whichever of the alternative methods is used during the phase-in period,
the figures currently required by the Federal Reserve Board for Regulation Z purposes will still be reported, in the
same form under which they have always been reported. This practice will minimize inconvenience for both the Federal
Reserve Board and lenders under Regulation Z.

Initial Escrow Account Statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required servicers to provide borrowers an initial escrow account statement at settlement. For
escrow accounts established after settlement, the proposed rule allowed an additional 45 days for the servicer to
provide an initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. Fifteen commenters wanted to eliminate this requirement.
Thirteen indicated that creating the initial escrow account statement is cumbersome and costly for servicers and
confusing to borrowers. Others argued that the provisions of the proposed regulation that required delivery of the
initial escrow account statement at settlement contradicted Section 10(c)(1)(B) of the statute. They claimed that
the statute permitted up to 45 days from settlement within which servicers could submit initial escrow account statements
to borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not specifically address table-funded transactions. Six commenters asked who would be responsible
for preparing the initial escrow account statement in table-funded transactions. They noted that loan correspondents,
brokers, and closing attorneys typically do not have the software and systems to produce the statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments asked how to compute the initial escrow deposits for a post-rule account. Three others suggested that
the final rule specifically state that the settlement agent may collect funds at closing for items that have a disbursement
date between the settlement and the initial payment date. Five commenters pointed out that some of the information
on the initial escrow account statement duplicated the HUD&hyph;1 settlement statement. They claimed that borrowers
received no additional benefit or disclosure from the separate statement. Four comments stated that HUD should provide
a suggested, rather than required, format for the initial escrow account statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, HUD notes that the RESPA statute as amended in 1990 requires servicers to provide borrowers
with initial escrow account statements. HUD is implementing that statutory requirement through this final rule.
In this final rule, the Department amends its proposed rule by expanding the timing requirements. The final rule permits
servicers to provide the initial escrow account statement at settlement or within 45 days of settlement for escrow
accounts that are established as a condition of the loan. The statute and rule also allow servicers to incorporate
the initial escrow account statement in the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement. Thus, some servicers
may avoid a purported duplication of information by including the initial escrow account statement in the HUD&hyph;1
settlement statement at closing. For escrow accounts established after settlement (and not as a condition of the
loan), the final rule allows an additional 45 days from the date the account is established for the servicer to provide
an initial escrow account statement to the borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these changes, the actual servicer of the loan, rather than a settlement agent, is more likely to prepare
the initial escrow account statement. HUD expects that in many table-funded transactions, for example, the servicer
that sets up the escrow account will be responsible for delivering the initial escrow account statement to the borrowers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the Department provides examples of how to compute the initial escrow deposits for a post-rule account.
The initial escrow account statement is a forward-looking projection of anticipated activity in the account's first
year. HUD's changes in the final rule should assure a higher degree of accuracy in the initial escrow account statements.
In addition, borrowers are likely to find less errors or discrepancies when comparing later annual escrow account
statements with the initial statement.

Annual Escrow Account Statements and Escrow Account Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's December 3, 1993, proposed rule required servicers to submit annual escrow account statements to borrowers
for every federally related mortgage loan for which there is an outstanding escrow account. In its proposed definitions,
HUD defined an ``escrow account analysis'' as a practice of computing a trial running balance that a servicer performs
to prepare the initial and annual escrow account statements. Twenty-six commenters asked HUD to clarify the difference
between the annual escrow account statement and the escrow account analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD considers the annual escrow account statement to be the borrower's tool to check the past year's escrow account
activities and the projections for the next year. As such, HUD believes that servicers need to perform an escrow account
analysis to make the statements meaningful. An escrow account analysis, therefore, is one step in the process of preparing
the escrow account statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-two commenters stated that when preparing the escrow account analysis, servicers should exclude from the
trial running balance calculations unexpected deposits to the escrow account, such as ``loss drafts'' (insurance
payments), and anticipated or actual earnings, such as interest. HUD concurs and excludes these deposits from the
trial running balance calculations. However, if there is a special assessment to the borrower that impacts the escrow
account within the escrow account computation year (e.g., water purification, road or utility assessments or special
condominium assessments), then the servicer may choose to conduct an escrow account analysis at the time of the assessment
and adjust the account accordingly. Some assessments may be billed for periods longer than a year. For example, flood
insurance or water purification escrow funds may be payable on a three-year cycle. HUD's final rule provides guidance
on how to calculate the account limits when the account includes such payables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule specified that the servicer deliver the annual escrow account statement to a borrower within 30
days of the conclusion of the escrow account computation year. Four commenters thought that the term escrow account
computation year should be changed to escrow computation cycle. They believed that this name change would allow servicers
to spread out the work load more efficiently during the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen commenters advocated more flexibility in when to conduct the escrow analyses, especially when servicers
experience delays in obtaining pertinent information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tax bills). These commenters recommended delaying the escrow analysis to provide a more meaningful statement, rather
than performing one on schedule merely to comply with a regulatory requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commented that the escrow analysis is generally prepared after the largest disbursement is made from the escrow
account. Two commenters were not sure whether the proposed rule permitted the escrow account analysis to be performed
on more than an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, HUD maintains a requirement of at least one escrow account analysis per year. Servicers
are free to do more. The servicer will need to perform the analysis in preparing the annual escrow account statements.
HUD retains the definition of escrow account computation year because it corresponds to the statute's 12 month period
reference. Through the use of short year statements, servicers may set the escrow account computation year to coincide
with the largest payment in the account, normally taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-nine commenters claimed that HUD's proposed annual escrow account statement requirements were confusing
to borrowers and costly for servicers to implement and prepare. (These comments came from 26 banks, 30 mortgage companies,
7 attorneys, and 6 associations.) Three commenters requested elimination of the trial running balance, since it
appeared unnecessary and confusing to borrowers. They also believed that the annual escrow account statements should
be more general. The comments argued that it was too costly to develop and administer programs to provide tailored
explanations. One software company stated that ``several statements on the annual statement may be impossible to
provide using an automated system. *&blank;*&blank;* Generally, data processing systems are not designed to provide
this type of annotated explanations. This type of artificial intelligence is cost prohibitive.'' Further, the commenters
stated that the final rule should provide suggested, not required, disclosures and format.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response, the Department simplifies the format for the annual escrow account statement in the final rule. HUD provides
sample statements for both single-item accounting and aggregate accounting practices. In each, the annual escrow
account statement includes a historical description of what actually was paid in and out of the account in the previous
computation year. It also contains a forward-looking projection of anticipated activity in the account for the next
year. The escrow account statements are prepared like bank statements, in a format that is familiar to the borrowers.
By doing so, the Department intends that the borrowers will be able to better understand account activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is sensitive to the concern that the statements may be too specific in nature. However, some specific information
is necessary to make the disclosure useful to borrowers. If the account has exceeded the RESPA limits during the year,
then the servicer must explain why. If the mortgage documents require a lower cushion, then the servicer will use that
amount. The example provides a checklist for servicers to complete to explain why an account exceeded RESPA's limits.
The Department concludes that borrowers need this explanation; otherwise, over-escrowing of accounts may continue.
In addition, for borrowers who closely monitor their escrow accounts, HUD believes that the annual escrow account
statements will provide sufficient information to borrowers to save servicers time otherwise spent in responding
to borrower inquiries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-one commenters suggested that the annual escrow account statement be divided into two separate statements:
(1) An annual escrow account statement providing historical information that the servicers mail to borrowers with
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information at calendar year-end; and (2) an escrow analysis statement, including
the projection of the next cycle's calculations, that the servicers deliver to borrowers within 30 to 60 days of completing
the escrow computation cycle. This practice would benefit servicers by combining part of the annual escrow account
statement with existing IRS requirements. It would also benefit the borrowers by providing information in a useful
and understandable fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considers these comments informative. Many servicers will provide two such accountings to borrowers
anyway. The IRS information requires calendar year-end totals. The year-end statements, however, do not necessarily
correspond with the servicer's escrow account computation year. At any time, however, servicers may change the escrow
account computation year to a calendar year-end period by using short year statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-five comments wanted HUD to exclude foreclosures and loans that are 60 days or more delinquent from the rule's
requirements for annual escrow account analysis and statements. In the final rule, HUD provides that servicers need
not submit an annual escrow account statement if the mortgage loan account is delinquent (30 days or more) or if the
servicer has initiated a foreclosure action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Short Year Annual Escrow Account Statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required the servicer to issue a short year annual escrow account statement to a borrower within
60 days of a loan payoff or 30 days of a transfer of servicing. Fifty-five commenters opposed these requirements, including
32 mortgage companies, 16 banks, 3 associations, and 4 attorneys. They stated that the IRS requires such information
at calendar-year end; thus, they claimed, HUD's requirement was unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that servicers should provide borrowers with relevant information at a meaningful time,
when borrowers will focus their attention on the information. HUD believes that borrowers should have the opportunity
to correct escrow account errors when servicing is transferred or soon after loan pay-off. If servicers fail to deliver
this information to borrowers for up to 12 months after the event, borrowers will be less likely to obtain corrective
action of any errors made. Consequently, the final rule retains the short year escrow account statement provisions,
although the Department has extended to 60 days the time for a transferor servicer to submit a short year statement
to the borrower.

Upon the transfer of loan servicing to a new servicer, the proposed rule required the new servicer to perform an escrow
account analysis before making any change to a borrower's escrow deposits. The proposed rule required the new servicer
to submit an initial escrow account statement to the borrower within 45 days after establishing the new escrow account.
Thirty-seven commenters asked HUD to eliminate this requirement. They questioned the benefit to the borrower and
the time and cost involved in preparing the statement. Seven commenters suggested that HUD extend to at least 90 days
the deadline for submitting the initial escrow account statement, because of integration issues associated with
transfers of servicing. Three commenters were unclear whether the initial escrow account statement was required
if the new servicer does not change the borrower's required escrow deposits or if the method of escrow account analysis
does not change between servicers. Two comments stated that if the initial escrow account statement is required,
it should be prepared by the transferor servicer, because that servicer performs an escrow account analysis before
transferring the account. One comment questioned whether the initial escrow account statement applied to transfers
of servicing between affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concludes that borrowers will benefit by receiving initial escrow account statements from new servicers
under certain circumstances. The final rule requires a new servicer to provide a borrower with an initial escrow account
statement if the servicer changes either the monthly payment amount or the accounting method previously used by the
transferor servicer. Because post-rule accounts will be using aggregate accounting methods, no initial escrow
account statement is needed for post-rule account transfers of servicing. In pre-rule accounts where there is a change
in the escrow account balances, the new servicer shall use the effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish
the new escrow account computation year. Where there is no change in the escrow account balances, the new servicer
shall continue the escrow account computation year that the transferor servicer started. (The Department expects
to publish soon a final rule on mortgage servicing transfers, adding a new &sect;3500.21 to Regulation X.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, HUD extends the time for new servicers to deliver the initial escrow account statement from
45 to 60 days from the date of servicing transfer. The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses, and deficiencies
in the transferred escrow account according to the procedures set forth in &sect;3500.17(f). A pre-rule account
remains a pre-rule account upon the transfer to a new servicer, as long as the transfer occurs before the conversion
date.

Surpluses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eleven comments requested clarification of HUD's proposed ``surplus'' definition. HUD's proposal defined a surplus
to be an amount, determined at the time of escrow analysis, by which an escrow account balance exceeds the target balance
for the account. The comments indicated that HUD's definition should state that a surplus is a balance in excess of
the allowable cushion, if any. HUD disagrees. HUD believes that its definition in the final rule more accurately describes
the surplus to be the excess of the current balance over the target balance. The target balance reflects the borrower's
accrued payments for escrow account items 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the cushion selected by the servicer. A servicer may choose to use no cushion or one that is less than the maximum set
by RESPA. It is therefore incorrect to state that the surplus is the balance that exceeds the allowable cushion. HUD
retains the term target balance, rather than allowable cushion, in its definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required servicers to refund surpluses to a borrower within 30 days of the escrow analysis unless
the borrower timely instructed the servicer to apply the surplus to the escrow account balance. Many commenters saw
HUD's requirement as increasing their administrative burdens. Fifteen commenters pointed out that the 30-day period
was unrealistic. They argued that HUD should either extend the timeframe or eliminate the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's proposal set no dollar threshold for refunding surpluses. Fifty-three commenters advocated that the final
rule require servicers to refund automatically surpluses above a minimum threshold ($25 to $50). This way servicers
would not have to wait for the borrower's instructions. Thirteen others suggested that servicers be permitted discretion
to retain a surplus below a nominal amount. Forty comments opposed refunding surpluses if the borrower is delinquent
or in default. Sixteen comments stated that the rule should allow servicers the discretion to refund surpluses immediately
or to spread out the payments over a 12-month period. Several comments requested clarification on whether the existence
of a surplus violated RESPA. Two comments specifically stated that a servicer who handles a surplus according to these
rules is in compliance with RESPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Department has revised the final rule to require the servicer to refund to the borrower
any surplus that is greater than or equal to $50. This provision responds to the comments concerning timing and administrative
problems in obtaining borrower instructions. At the servicer's option, the servicer may refund to the borrower or
credit to the borrower's escrow account a surplus of less than $50. Again, the servicer need not interact with the borrower
to handle this surplus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's final rule provides that if the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment
due date, then the servicer may retain the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan document.
It also provides that if the servicer has brought an action for foreclosure under the mortgage loan, then the servicer
may retain any surplus in the escrow account according to the mortgage loan documents. If a servicer meets the provisions
of this final rule, then HUD will deem the servicer in compliance with RESPA.

Shortages and Deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule defined a shortage to be the amount that the servicer estimates at the time of an escrow account analysis
will be needed to meet the target balance for the escrow account. A deficiency, on the other hand, is the amount that
a servicer has actually advanced to pay a disbursement from the escrow account. HUD had proposed that servicers allow
borrowers up to 12 months to pay shortages or deficiencies in the escrow account. Many commenters thought HUD's proposal
required servicers to extend interest-free loans to borrowers. For example, Fannie Mae stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;*
this requires the servicer to extend what is in essence a 12-month interest-free loan to the borrower. We believe that
this financial burden on the servicer is inequitable.'' Fifteen commenters wanted servicers to charge borrowers
interest at the note rate while advances for a deficiency are outstanding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD received numerous suggestions to change these provisions. Thirty-nine commenters suggested that the rule allow
servicers to collect shortages from borrowers within 30 days to 6 months from the date of the analysis. The comments
indicated that servicers could always allow borrowers more time (12 or more months) to pay a projected shortage than
is required by law. Sixty-six comments recommended that the rule allow servicers to collect deficiencies from borrowers
within 30 days to 6 months from the disbursement date. These comments also stated that servicers could choose to provide
borrowers with more time than legally mandated. Another comment sought immediate payment of servicer advances arising
from borrower-initiated changes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
additional or optional insurance). Six comments noted that there is no need for a separate servicer notice to borrowers
of shortages in the escrow account, because the annual escrow statement fulfills this function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD sees a distinction between a shortage and a deficiency in the escrow account. In a situation where the servicer
has advanced its own funds (a deficiency), HUD believes that the servicer may collect this advance quickly. In the
final rule, HUD provides servicers with three possible ways of handling borrower deficiencies that amount to less
than one month's escrow payment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The servicer may allow a deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer may require the borrower to pay the deficiency within 30 days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The servicer may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments over a period of up
to 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the deficiency is equal to or more than one month's escrow payment, then the servicer may allow a deficiency to exist
and do nothing to change it, or the servicer may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly
payments over a period of up to 12 months. Moreover, if the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within
30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan
documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because a shortage is the difference between the current escrow account balance and the target balance, HUD believes
that shortages warrant different treatment than deficiencies. Borrowers' escrow accounts are likely to be influenced
by yearly changes in taxes, insurance, or other items that may cause a shortage at the time of an escrow account analysis.
At that time, servicers may easily adjust the borrower's monthly escrow payments for the next year. Thus, in the final
rule, HUD provides that if the servicer's escrow account analysis indicates a shortage of less than one month's escrow
payment, the servicer has three options: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay the shortage amount within 30 days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay off the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the shortage is greater than or equal to one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer has two options: the
servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; or the servicer may allow the borrower to pay off the
shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An escrow account analysis may indicate a shortage at the time of the analysis that will produce a deficiency at a later
date. This rule does not allow servicers to anticipate deficiencies and collect on a deficiency in advance. However,
at the time of a deficiency, a servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis and seek repayment from a borrower according
to these provisions.

Timely Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In implementing Section 6(g) of RESPA, HUD had proposed that servicers make disbursements in a timely manner from
the escrow account, even if the escrow account had insufficient funds for such payments, as long as the borrower was
current in the borrower's principal, interest, and escrow account payments. Twenty-eight commenters opposed this
requirement. On the other hand, Fannie Mae noted that ``while the proposed rule states that servicers are not required
to make escrow account payments on delinquent accounts, Fannie Mae holds the servicer responsible for the timely
payment of taxes and insurance premiums even in situations where the borrower is delinquent on the mortgage.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments and reviewing the legislative history of Section 6(g) of RESPA, the Department
clarifies the requirement. Section 3500.17(k) of this rule implements Section 6(g) of the statute, by requiring
servicers to advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner as long as the servicer receives the borrower's
payment within 30 days of the payment due date. HUD clarifies that a timely payment is one in which the servicer pays
the disbursement on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the deadline for available discounts or the deadline to avoid penalties. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement,
the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f). If the servicer
advances payments for a borrower who is in default, however, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant
to the terms of the mortgage loan documents. The Department expects that servicers will continue to make disbursements
on delinquent accounts to protect their security interests in the mortgaged properties.

Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule established a five-year recordkeeping requirement. Sixteen commenters stated that this requirement
would be expensive and burdensome. Several suggested that two years was a more reasonable period. Seventeen commenters
requested that HUD provide a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
standard describing the information that servicers should retain. They wanted the final rule to specify whether
servicers can retain records in hard-copy, electronic, or microfiche format. Seventeen comments requested that
the rule provide examples of noncompliance subject to penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the December 1993 proposed rule, HUD responded to earlier comments critical of HUD's specific recordkeeping provisions
in the December 1991 proposal. In this final rule, HUD adds clarifying language that servicers may maintain records
in hard-copy, electronic, microfiche, or any other format that reasonably assures retrieval. The Department maintains
the five-year record retention provision. It is consistent with RESPA's other retention requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty-eight commenters suggested that the final rule not reflect the strict liability language of the proposed rule.
The majority believed that servicers should not be held liable for clerical errors, inadvertent acts, or acts of nature.
They also indicated that servicers should not be liable for expending ``best and reasonable efforts'' in complying
with the requirements. The comments advocated that penalties be based on practices and patterns of noncompliance.
The MBA concurred and stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* HUD should determine violations that warrant a monetary penalty
based on a pattern or practice of noncompliance. Penalties would be justified in those cases where the servicer made
the same error repeatedly.'' Ten comments suggested that the rule include a cure period, in which the servicer could
submit a corrective statement to a borrower within 60 days of discovering the error. They pointed out that similar
defenses are permitted by other consumer protection statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Strict liability is a term used in product liability law and HUD misapplied the term in the proposed rule. The final
rule removes any reference to a strict liability standard. However, HUD continues the statutory distinction between
unintentional and intentional violations. Violations do not require any proof of intent. The statute provides for
more serious penalties in cases of a servicer's intentional disregard for the statute's requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a statement of its enforcement policy, the Department is likely to pursue cases involving a pattern and practice
of noncompliance more vigorously than solitary or minor transgressions of these provisions. HUD is less likely to
enforce penalties in cases where the servicer has taken prompt corrective action on its own initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Civil Penalties Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received eight comments concerning the civil penalties procedures provisions. They suggested that HUD lengthen
the time for servicers to prepare an adequate defense. The commenters suggested that the time to respond to a notice
of intent to impose penalties be extended from 20 to 30 days. They wanted HUD to extend the period in which a servicer
presents its evidence from 45 to 60 days. They also recommended extending the period for filing for judicial review
of a decision from 20 to 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department extends from 20 to 30 days the initial response period to HUD's notice of intent to impose
penalties. Because the rule permits the servicer to request additional time from the administrative law judge, HUD
sees no need to extend the time for presenting evidence. Responding to comments, the final rule provides 30 days for
a party to file a petition seeking judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Financial Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seventeen commenters were concerned about the rule's effect upon the value of mortgage servicing rights. They estimated
that servicing rights may be reduced in value by 3 to 20 percent. Three commenters requested that the final rule be applicable
only to loans originated after the effective date, thus resulting in less impact on the value of servicing rights.
Four stated that capital structures would be negatively affected for institutions with servicing rights regulated
by government agencies (e.g., FDIC, OCC, OTS, Federal Reserve Board). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that the rule has an adverse effect on the pricing of mortgage servicing. HUD's issuance
of the December 3, 1993, proposed rule has already affected the value of mortgage servicing pricing. However, as indicated
above, the Department believes that the three-year phase-in period somewhat tempers this effect. The phase-in period
allows servicers to recoup the greatest value on their servicing rights in the early years of a mortgage loan, while
the rule moves the industry to a simpler system that protects consumers as soon as practicable.

Legal Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-three commenters questioned HUD's statutory authority to mandate interest-free loans to borrowers under
RESPA. Five stated that the final rule should address compliance issues with individual State requirements. One
commenter indicated that HUD left unaddressed how State rules take precedence or supersede the final rule. One respondent
requested that the rule clarify whether RESPA establishes an escrow ceiling cushion and does not preempt State law
or contracts between lenders and borrowers. A second stated that the final rule should address the impact the regulations
will have on contractual relationships related to securitization arrangements. A third requested clarification
of loans that are exempt from RESPA provisions pending HUD's final rule. Four commenters believed that the proposed
rule could lead to an increase in escrow class action suits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that it has full legal authority and administrative discretion to implement these escrow
accounting regulations. Section 19(a) of RESPA empowers the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations to achieve
the purpose of the Act. This final rule reflects HUD's interpretation of the statute and HUD's reaction to public comments
on the proposed rule. In issuing this rule, HUD considers the needs of borrowers and servicers and interprets the statute
to respond to those needs. For example, in response to comments regarding interest-free loans, HUD recast certain
provisions in the final rule. One of HUD's goals here is to promote Section 6's provisions that disbursements from
escrow be made timely. At the same time, the final rule responds to servicers' needs for prompt reimbursement of their
advances, and is fair to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the possible preemption of State laws, the Department recognizes that many of the States have enacted laws
relating to escrow accounts. Section 18 of RESPA provides: ``This Act does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any
person subject to the provisions of (RESPA) from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to settlement practices,
except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of (RESPA), and then only to the extent of the
inconsistency.'' 12 USC 2616. Given this statutory language, and further statutory instruction that a state statute
is not to be preempted if it gives greater protection to the consumer, the Department believes it should make specific
preemption decisions on a case-by-case basis. The current RESPA rule (&sect;3500.13(c)) sets forth provisions
for requesting preemption determinations.

to conform with these regulatory changes. HUD therefore amends &sect;203.550(a) to clarify that the FHA mortgagee
shall use the procedures contained in &sect;3500.17 to compute the amount of escrow, the methods of collection and
accounting, and the disbursement of escrow account items. HUD also amends &sect;234.38 to conform with the final
rule, and retains the language of &sect;203.550(c) that permits FHA mortgagees to estimate escrow requirements
based on the probable payments required for special assessment items, such as water purification escrow funds.

Aggregate Accounting At Settlement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the settlement agent uses a cushion in determining the initial entries for lines 1000&hyph;1008 of the HUD&hyph;1
or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement, then the settlement agent shall make an adjustment to reflect the appropriate
starting balance in the escrow account under the aggregate accounting method. The cushion using the aggregate accounting
is computed according to the steps set out in &sect;3500.17(d). The adjustment reflects the difference between the
amounts collected as a cushion in the 1000 series for individual escrow items under the single-item accounting method
and the permissible cushion under the aggregate accounting method. The servicer shall enter the aggregate adjustment
amount on the last line in the 1000 series of the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the phase-in period, as defined in &sect;3500.17(b), an alternative procedure is available. The settlement
agent may initially calculate the 1000 series deposits for the HUD&hyph;1 and HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement
using single-item analysis with only a one-month cushion (unless the mortgage loan documents indicate a smaller
amount). In the escrow account analysis conducted within 45 days of settlement, however, the servicer shall adjust
the escrow account to reflect the aggregate accounting balance. Appendix F to this part sets out examples of aggregate
analysis. Appendix A to this part contains instructions for completing the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement
statements using an aggregate analysis adjustment and the alternative process during the phase-in period.

General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets out the requirements for an escrow account that a lender establishes in connection with a federally
related mortgage loan. It sets limits for escrow accounts using calculations based on monthly payments and disbursements
within a calendar year. If an escrow account involves biweekly or any other payment period, the requirements in this
section shall be modified accordingly. Appendix H to this part provides an example of the transposition from monthly
to biweekly accounting and Appendix J to this part provides an example of a 3-year accounting cycle that may be used
in accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

 (1) A lender or servicer (hereafter servicer) shall not require a borrower to deposit into any escrow account, created
in connection with a federally related mortgage loan, more than the following amounts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Charges at settlement or upon creation of an escrow account.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the time a servicer creates an escrow account for a borrower, the servicer may charge the borrower an amount sufficient
to pay the charges respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, which are attributable to the period
from the date such payment(s) were last paid until the initial payment date. In addition, the servicer may charge the
borrower a cushion that shall be no greater than one-sixth (1/6) of the estimated total annual payments from the escrow
account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Charges during the life of the escrow account.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Throughout the life of an escrow account, the servicer may charge the borrower a monthly sum equal to one-twelfth (1/12)
of the total annual escrow payments which the servicer reasonably anticipates paying from the account. In addition,
the servicer may add an amount to maintain a cushion no greater than one-sixth (1/6) of the estimated total annual payments
from the account. However, if a servicer determines through an escrow account analysis that there is a shortage or
deficiency, the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional deposits to make up the shortage or eliminate
the deficiency, subject to the limitations set forth in &sect;3500.17(f).

 Before establishing an escrow account, the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the amount
the borrower shall deposit into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of &sect;3500.17(c)(1)(i) and the
amount of the borrower's periodic payments into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of &sect;3500.17(c)(1)(ii).
In conducting the escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate the disbursement amounts according to &sect;3500.17(c)(7).
Pursuant to &sect;3500.17(k), the servicer shall use a date on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement
date for the escrow item. Upon completing the initial escrow account analysis, the servicer shall prepare and deliver
an initial escrow account statement to the borrower, as set forth in &sect;3500.17(g). The servicer shall use the
escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage or deficiency exists since settlement and shall
make any adjustments to the account pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f).

 For each escrow account, the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis at the completion of the escrow account
computation year to determine the borrower's monthly escrow account payments for the next computation year, subject
to the limitations of &sect;3500.17(c)(1)(ii). In conducting the escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate
the disbursement amounts according to &sect;3500.17(c)(7). Pursuant to &sect;3500.17(k), the servicer shall
use a date on or before the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement
date for the escrow item. The servicer shall use the escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage
or deficiency exists and shall make any adjustments to the account pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f). Upon completing
an escrow account analysis, the servicer shall prepare and submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower,
as set forth in &sect;3500.17(i).

Acceptable accounting methods to determine escrow limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-rule accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For pre-rule accounts, servicers may use either single-item analysis or aggregate-analysis during the phase-in
period. In conducting the escrow account analysis, servicers shall use ``month-end'' accounting. Under month-end
accounting, the timing of the disbursements and payments within the month is irrelevant. As of the conversion date,
all pre-rule accounts shall comply with the requirements for post-rule accounts in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this
section. During the phase-in period, the transfer of servicing of a pre-rule account to another servicer does not
convert the account to a post-rule account. After the effective date of this rule, refinancing transactions (as defined
in &sect;3500.2) shall comply with the requirements for post-rule accounts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Post-rule accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For post-rule accounts, servicers shall use aggregate accounting to conduct an escrow account analysis. In conducting
the escrow account analysis, servicers shall use ``month-end'' accounting. Under month-end accounting, the timing
of the disbursements and payments within the month is irrelevant.

Cushion.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For post-rule accounts, the cushion shall be no greater than one-sixth (1/6) of the estimated total annual disbursements
from the escrow account using aggregate analysis accounting. For pre-rule accounts, the cushion may not exceed the
total of one-sixth of the estimated annual disbursements for each escrow account item using single-item analysis
accounting. In determining the cushion using single-item analysis, a servicer shall not divide an escrow account
item into sub-accounts, even if the payee requires installment payments.

Restrictions on pre-accrual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For pre-rule accounts, a servicer shall not require any pre-accrual that results in the escrow account balance exceeding
the limits of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In addition, if the mortgage documents in a pre-rule account are silent
about the amount of pre-accrual, the servicer shall not require in excess of one month of pre-accrual, subject to the
additional limitations provided in paragraph (c)(8) of this section. For post-rule accounts, a servicer shall not
practice pre-accrual.

Servicer estimates of disbursement amounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To conduct an escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate the amount of escrow account items to be disbursed.
If the servicer knows the charge for an escrow item in the next computation year, then the servicer shall use that amount
in estimating disbursement amounts. If the charge is unknown to the servicer, the servicer may base the estimate on
the preceding year's charge, or the preceding year's charge as modified by an amount not exceeding the most recent
year's change in the national Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI, all items). In cases of unassessed
new construction, the servicer may base an estimate on the assessment of comparable residential property in the market
area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provisions in mortgage documents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The servicer shall examine the mortgage loan documents to determine the applicable cushion and limitations on pre-accrual
for each escrow account. If the mortgage loan documents provide for lower cushion limits or less pre-accrual than
this rule, then the terms of the loan documents apply. Where the terms of any mortgage loan document allow greater payments
to an escrow account than allowed by this rule, then this rule controls the applicable limits. Where the mortgage loan
documents do not specifically establish an escrow account, whether a servicer may establish an escrow account for
the loan is a matter for determination by State law. If the mortgage loan document is silent on the escrow account limits
(for cushion or pre-accrual) and a servicer establishes an escrow account under State law, then the limitations of
this rule apply unless State law provides for a lower amount. If the loan documents provide for escrow accounts up to
the RESPA limits, then the servicer may require the maximum amounts consistent with this rule, unless an applicable
State law sets a lesser amount.

Assessments for periods longer than one year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some escrow account items may be billed for periods longer than one year. For example, servicers may need to collect
flood insurance or water purification escrow funds for payment every three years. In such cases, the servicer shall
estimate the borrower's payments for a full cycle of disbursements. For a flood insurance premium payable every 3
years, the servicer shall collect the payments reflecting 36 equal monthly amounts. For two out of the three years,
however, the account balance may not reach its low monthly balance because the low point will be on a three-year cycle,
as compared to an annual one. The annual escrow account statement shall explain this situation (see example in Appendix
J to this part).

Methods of escrow account analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (c) of this section prescribes acceptable accounting methods. The following sets forth the steps servicers
shall use to determine whether their use of an acceptable accounting method conforms with the limitations in &sect;3500.17(c)(1).
The steps set forth in this section derive maximum limits. Servicers may use accounting procedures that result in
lower target balances. In particular, servicers may use a cushion less than the permissible cushion or no cushion
at all. This section does not require the use of a cushion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aggregate analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When a servicer uses aggregate analysis in conducting the escrow account analysis, the target balances may not
exceed the balances computed according to the following arithmetic operations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for the account as a whole over the next computation year (a trial running
balance). In doing so the servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before the earlier of the
deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use
pre-accrual on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that the borrower will make monthly payments
equal to one-twelfth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balances and adds to the first monthly balance an amount just sufficient
to bring the lowest monthly trial balance to zero, and adjusts all other monthly balances accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (C) The servicer then adds to the monthly balances the permissible cushion. The cushion is two months of the borrower's
escrow payments to the servicer or a lesser amount specified by State law or the mortgage document (net of any increases
or decreases because of prior year shortages or surpluses, respectively). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lowest monthly balance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under aggregate analysis, the lowest monthly target balance for the account shall be less than or equal to one-sixth
of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements or a lesser amount specified by State law or the mortgage
document. The target balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield the maximum limit for the escrow account.
Appendix F to this part illustrates these steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Single-item or other non-aggregate analysis method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When a servicer uses single-item analysis or any hybrid accounting method in conducting an escrow account analysis
during the phase-in period, the target balances may not exceed the balances computed according to the following arithmetic
operations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for each item over the next computation year (a trial running balance).
In doing so the servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before the earlier of the deadline
to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use pre-accrual
on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that the borrower will make periodic payments equal to one-twelfth
of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balance for each escrow account item and adds to the first monthly
balance for each separate item an amount just sufficient to bring the lowest monthly trial balance for that item to
zero, and then adjusts all other monthly balances accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The servicer then adds the permissible cushion, if any, to the monthly balance for the separate escrow account
item. The permissible cushion is two months of escrow payments for the escrow account item (net of any increases or
decreases because of prior year shortages or surpluses, respectively) or a lesser amount specified by State law or
the mortgage document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The servicer then examines the balances for each item to make certain that the lowest monthly balance for that item
is less than or equal to one-sixth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements for that item or a lesser
amount specified by State law or the mortgage document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In performing an escrow account analysis using single-item analysis, servicers may account for each escrow
account item separately, but servicers shall not further divide accounts into sub-accounts, even if the payee of
a disbursement requires installment payments. The target balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield
the maximum limit for the escrow account. Appendix F to this part illustrates these steps.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfer of servicing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the new servicer changes either the monthly payment amount or the accounting method used by the transferor (old)
servicer, then the new servicer shall provide the borrower with an initial escrow account statement within 60 days
of the date of servicing transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where a new servicer provides an initial escrow account statement upon the transfer of servicing, the new servicer
shall use the effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish the new escrow account computation year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the new servicer retains the monthly payments and accounting method used by the transferor servicer, then
the new servicer may continue to use the escrow account computation year established by the transferor servicer or
may choose to establish a different computation year using a short-year statement. At the completion of the escrow
account computation year or any short year, the new servicer shall perform an escrow analysis and provide the borrower
with an annual escrow account statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses and deficiencies in the transferred escrow account according
to the procedures set forth in &sect;3500.17(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) As noted in &sect;&sect;3500.17(c)(2) and (3), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis upon establishing
an escrow account and at completion of the escrow account computation year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis at other times during the escrow computation year. If a servicer
advances funds in paying a disbursement, which is not the result of a borrower's payment default under the underlying
mortgage document, then the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the extent of the deficiency
before seeking repayment of the funds from the borrower under this paragraph (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Surpluses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a surplus, the servicer shall, within 30 days from the date of the analysis,
refund the surplus to the borrower if the surplus is greater than or equal to 50 dollars ($50). If the surplus is less
than 50 dollars ($50), the servicer may refund such amount to the borrower, or credit such amount against the next year's
escrow payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) These provisions regarding surpluses apply if the borrower is current at the time of the escrow account analysis.
A borrower is current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days of the payment due date. If the
servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may retain
the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Shortages. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage of less than one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer
has three possible courses of action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The servicer may allow the borrower to pay the shortage amount within 30 days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The servicer may allow the borrower to repay the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage that is greater than or equal to one month's escrow account
payment, then the servicer has two possible courses of action: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The servicer shall allow the borrower to repay the shortage in equal monthly payments over a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deficiency.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the escrow account analysis confirms a deficiency, then the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional
monthly deposits to the account to eliminate the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the deficiency is less than one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) May allow the deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) May require the borrower to repay the deficiency within 30 days; or (C) May allow the borrower to repay the deficiency
in 2 or more equal monthly payments over a period of up to 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the deficiency is greater than or equal to 1 month's escrow account payment, the servicer may allow the deficiency
to exist and do nothing to change it or may allow the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments
over a period of up to 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) These provisions regarding deficiencies apply if the borrower is current at the time of the escrow account analysis.
A borrower is current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days of the payment due date. If the
servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may recover
the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Shortage or Deficiency in Escrow Account. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The servicer shall notify the borrower at least once during the escrow account computation year if there is a shortage

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in &sect;3500.17(c)(2), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis before establishing an escrow
account to determine the amount the borrower shall deposit into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of
&sect;3500.17(c)(1)(i). After conducting the escrow account analysis for each escrow account, the servicer shall
submit an initial escrow account statement to the borrower at settlement or within 45 calendar days of settlement
for escrow accounts that are established as a condition of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The initial escrow account statement shall include the amount of the borrower's monthly mortgage payment and
the portion of the monthly payment going into the escrow account and shall itemize the estimated taxes, insurance
premiums, and other charges that the servicer reasonably anticipates to be paid from the escrow account during the
escrow account computation year and the anticipated disbursement dates of those charges. The initial escrow account
statement shall indicate the amount that the servicer selects as a cushion. The statement shall include a trial running
balance for the account.

 This paragraph contains an exemption to the provision of &sect;3500.17(i)(1). If at the time the servicer conducts
the escrow account analysis the borrower is more than 30 days overdue, then the servicer is exempt from the requirements
of submitting an annual escrow account statement to the borrower under &sect;3500.17(i). This exemption also applies
in situations where the servicer has brought an action for foreclosure under the underlying mortgage loan.

Timely payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow account,
the servicer shall pay the disbursements in a timely manner, that is, by the disbursement date, so long as the borrower's
payment is not more than 30 days overdue. In calculating the disbursement date, the servicer shall use a date on or before
the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 earlier
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer shall advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner so long as the borrower's payment is not
more than 30 days overdue. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower
for the deficiency pursuant to &sect;3500.17(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
System of recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each servicer shall keep records, which may involve electronic storage, microfiche storage, or any method of
computerized storage, so long as the information is easily retrievable, reflecting the servicer's handling of each
borrower's escrow account. The servicer's records shall include, but not be limited to, the payment of amounts into
and from the escrow account and the submission of initial and annual escrow account statements to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicer responsible for servicing the borrower's escrow account shall maintain the records for that account
for a period of at least five years after the servicer last serviced the escrow account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A servicer shall provide the Secretary with information contained in the servicer's records for a specific escrow
account, or for a number or class of escrow accounts, within 30 days of the Secretary's written request for the information.
The servicer shall convert any information contained in electronic storage, microfiche or computerized storage
to paper copies for review by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To aid in investigations, the Secretary may also issue an administrative subpoena for the production of documents,
and for the testimony of such witnesses as the Secretary deems advisable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the subpoenaed party refuses to obey the Secretary's administrative subpoena, the Secretary is authorized
to seek a court order requiring compliance with the subpoena from any United States district court. Failure to obey
such an order of the court may be punished as contempt of court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Borrowers may seek information contained in the servicer's records by complying with the provisions set forth
in 12 U.S.C. 2605(e) and &sect;3500.21(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) After receiving a request (by letter or subpoena) from the Department for information relating to whether a servicer
submitted an escrow account statement to the borrower, the servicer shall respond within 30 days. If the servicer
is unable to provide the Department with such information, the Secretary shall deem that lack of information to be
evidence of the servicer's failure to submit the statement to the borrower.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A servicer's failure to submit to a borrower an initial or annual escrow account statement meeting the requirements
of this part shall constitute a violation of the RESPA and this section. For each such violation, the Secretary shall
assess a civil penalty of 50 dollars ($50), except that the total of the assessed penalties shall not exceed $100,000
for any one servicer for violations that occur during any consecutive 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Violations described in paragraph (m)(1) of this section do not require any proof of intent. However, if a lender
or servicer is shown to have intentionally disregarded the requirements that it submit the escrow account statement
to the borrower, then the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty of $100 for each violation, with no limit on the total
amount of the penalty.

Notice of intent to impose civil money penalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever the Secretary intends to impose a civil money penalty for violations of section 10(c) of RESPA (12 U.S.C.
2609(c)), the responsible program official, or his or her designee, shall serve a written Notice of Intent to Impose
Civil Money Penalties (Notice of Intent) upon any servicer on which the Secretary intends to impose the penalty. A
copy of the Notice of Intent must be filed with the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of Administrative Law Judges, at the address
provided in the Notice of Intent. The Notice of Intent will provide: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A short, plain statement of the facts upon which the Secretary has determined that a civil money penalty should
be imposed, including a brief description of the specific violations under 12 U.S.C. 2609(c) with which the servicer
is charged and whether such violations are believed to be intentional or unintentional in nature, or a combination
thereof; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount of the civil money penalty that the Secretary intends to impose and whether the limitations in 12 U.S.C.
2609(d)(1), apply; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The right of the servicer to a hearing on the record to appeal the Secretary's preliminary determination to impose
a civil penalty;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Answer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To appeal the imposition of a penalty, a servicer shall, within 30 days after receiving service of the Notice of Intent,
file a written Answer with the Chief Docket Clerk, Office of Administrative Law Judges, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, at the address provided in the Notice of Intent. The Answer shall include a statement that the servicer
admits, denies, or does not have (and is unable to obtain) sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation
made in the Notice of Intent. A statement of lack of information shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation that
is not denied shall be deemed admitted. Failure to submit an Answer within the required period of time will result in
a decision by the Administrative Law Judge based upon the Department's submission of evidence in the Notice of Intent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A servicer that receives the Notice of Intent has a right to present evidence. Evidence must be submitted within 45
calendar days from the date of service of the Notice of Intent, or by such other time as may be established by the Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ). The servicer's failure to submit evidence within the required period of time will result in a decision
by the Administrative Law Judge based upon the Department's submission of evidence in the Notice of Intent. The servicer
may present evidence of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The servicer did submit the required escrow account statement(s) to the borrower(s); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Even if the servicer did not submit the required statement(s), that the failure was not the result of an intentional
disregard of the requirements of the RESPA (for purposes of determining the penalty). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of the record. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Law Judge will review the evidence submitted by the servicer, if any, and that submitted by the
Department. The Administrative Law Judge shall make a determination based upon a review of the written record, except
that the Administrative Law Judge may order an oral hearing if he or she finds that the determination turns on the credibility
or veracity of a witness, or that the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence. If the Administrative
Law Judge decides that an oral hearing is appropriate, then the procedural rules set forth at 24 CFR part 30, subpart
E, shall apply, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden of Proof. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The burden of proof or the burden of going forward with the evidence shall be upon the proponent of an action. The Department's
submission of evidence that the servicer's system of records lacks information that the servicer submitted the escrow
account statement(s) to the borrower(s) shall satisfy the Department's burden. Upon the Department's presentation
of evidence of this lack of information in the servicer's system of records, the burden of proof shifts from the Secretary
to the servicer to provide evidence that it submitted the statement(s) to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Determination of the Administrative Law Judge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Following the hearing or the review of the written record, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a decision
that shall contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the amount of any penalties imposed. The decision shall
include a determination of whether the servicer has failed to submit any required statements and, if so, whether the
servicer's failure was the result of an intentional disregard for the law's requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Administrative Law Judge shall issue the decision to all parties within 30 days of the submission of the evidence
or the post-hearing briefs, whichever is the last to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If the settlement agent uses a cushion in determining the initial entries for lines 1000&hyph;1008 of the HUD&hyph;1
or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement, then the settlement agent shall make an adjustment to reflect the appropriate
starting balance in the escrow account under an aggregate accounting method. The cushion using the aggregate accounting
is computed according to the steps set out in &sect;3500.17(d). The adjustment reflects the difference between the
amounts collected as a cushion on the lines 1000&hyph;1008 for individual escrow items and the permissible cushion
under the aggregate accounting method. The servicer shall enter the aggregate adjustment amount on the final line
of the 1000 series of the HUD&hyph;1 or the HUD&hyph;1A statement. The amount will always be $&hyph;0&hyph; or a negative
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the phase-in period, as defined in &sect;3500.17(b), an alternative procedure is available. If a servicer
has not yet conducted the escrow account analysis to determine the aggregate accounting starting balance, the settlement
agent may initially calculate the 1000 series deposits for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD&hyph;1 and HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement using single-item analysis with a one-month cushion (unless the
mortgage loan documents indicate a smaller amount). In the escrow account analysis conducted within 45 days of settlement,
the servicer shall adjust the escrow account to reflect the aggregate accounting balance.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 A bank engages in a tie for purposes of section 106 by: (1) offering a discount on a product or service (the ``tying product'')
on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank
or from any of its affiliates; or (2) allowing the purchase of a product or service only if the customer purchases another
product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates. Violations of section 106 can be addressed by the Board
through an enforcement action, by the Department of Justice through a request for an injunction, or by a customer or
other party through an action for damages. 12 U.S.C. 1972, 1973, and 1975.

Section 106 contains an explicit exception (the ``statutory traditional bank product exception'') that permits
a bank to tie a product or service to a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service offered by that bank. The Board has recently
extended this exception by providing that a bank or any of its affiliates also may vary the consideration for a traditional
bank product on condition that the customer obtain another traditional bank product from an affiliate (the ``regulatory
traditional bank product exception'').

Section 106 authorizes the Board to grant exceptions to its restrictions by regulation or order. On October 19, 1994,
the Board granted an exemption permitting the subsidiary banks of Fleet Financial Group, Inc., Providence, Rhode
Island (Fleet) to offer a discount on the monthly service fee charged for the ``Fleet One Account'' to a customer who
maintains a combined minimum balance of $10,000 in one or more products selected by the customer from a menu of eligible
Fleet products. The Board decided that, to the extent that Fleet's combined-balance discount was prohibited by section
106, an exemption was warranted given the public benefits and absence of anti-competitive concerns generated by
the arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fleet One Account provides a customer, for a $14 monthly fee, discounts and premiums on various Fleet services,
such as free checking and lower installment loan rates. Under the Board's order, Fleet may waive the $14 fee for any
customer who maintains a $10,000 combined balance among the following eligible products: (1) deposits and certain
loans at the Fleet bank at which the customer establishes the Fleet One Account;
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 (2) credit card balances at a Fleet bank; (3) investment securities held at Fleet's brokerage subsidiary and (4) shares
held in a family of mutual funds advised by a Fleet subsidiary. All products offered as part of these arrangements are
separately available to customers at competitive prices.

Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is proposing to use its statutory authority to grant a regulatory exception to section 106 for combined-balance
discount arrangements akin to that offered by Fleet. The Board is proposing the exception in order to provide certainty
as to the general permissibility of combined-balance discounts, and because it believes that such discounts are
pro-consumer and not anti-competitive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The combined-balance discount offered by Fleet appears to be covered by section 106, which prohibits a bank from offering
a discount on a product or service on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service from
the bank or from any of its affiliates. Although the discount on the Fleet One Account fee is not conditioned on any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
particular 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
product being purchased, the customer is required to purchase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
some 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
product or products from the menu of eligible products in order to receive the discount.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, the packaging of some of those products in the form proposed by Fleet does not appear to qualify for the
statutory or regulatory traditional bank product exception.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Coverage of combined-balance discounts also appears to be consistent with the purposes of section 106. Section 106
was enacted because of Congress's concern that banks would use their power over credit to gain a competitive advantage
in other markets. Ordinarily, a tying arrangement involves an attempt to gain a competitive advantage in one product
market, but the fact that a bank is attempting to gain a smaller advantage in a larger number of product markets raises
similar concerns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Board's regulations, a bank or nonbank could offer a discount on brokerage services on condition that a customer
purchase a traditional bank product from the bank or company offering the brokerage services or from an affiliate.
However, no exception allows the reverse case, where discounts on bank products are being used to induce customers
to purchase brokerage services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, although the discount plan offered by Fleet is structured so as to avoid any anti-competitive effects,
the Board notes that in other cases the number and attractiveness of traditional bank products offered in such an arrangement
could be substantially less than those offered by Fleet, and the effect of the tie to non-traditional products that
much stronger. In addition, there is the potential for such discount plans to be manipulated in order to have the same
effect as a classic tie_that is, structured so that the customer is effectively required to purchase one product in
order to receive, or to receive a discount on, another product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In deciding to permit Fleet to offer the Fleet One Account, the Board concluded that the combined-balance discount
on the Fleet One Account was consistent with the type of banking relationships that section 106 recognized were important
to preserve.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Section 106 preserves such relationships through the statutory traditional bank product exception, which permits
a bank to tie a product or service to a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service offered by that bank. The legislative
history of section 106 notes that this exception was intended to preserve a customer's ability to negotiate the price
of multiple banking services with the bank on the basis of the customer's entire relationship with the bank. The proposed
exception serves the same purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also granted Fleet an exemption allowing Fleet banks to condition the Fleet One Account on a customer's obtaining
two products from Fleet, but the Board is not proposing to make this exemption broadly available through regulation.
Rather, the Board has concluded that such exemptions should be granted on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, under the statutory and regulatory traditional bank product exceptions, a bank already could offer a combined-balance
discount on an account where all the products in the arrangement were traditional bank products (loans, discounts,
deposits, and trust services). Granting an exception for a combined-balance discount would simply permit the bank
to increase customer choice by adding a customer's securities brokerage account or other non-traditional products
to the menu of traditional products that count toward the minimum balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Board is proposing to establish, through a regulatory exception, a safe harbor for arrangements
offering benefits similar to those in Fleet. The proposed safe harbor is not only consistent with the statute's goal
of preserving traditional banking relationships, but also its concerns about anti-competitive behavior. The proposal
requires that the offering bank offer deposits and that all such deposits be considered in determining whether the
customer has reached the minimum balance required to waive the relevant fee. Furthermore, all products offered as
part of the arrangement would be required to be separately available for purchase at competitive prices.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Because a customer could qualify for a combined-balance discount based solely on deposit balances and because the
bank would be required to offer customers all products involved in the arrangement separately and at competitive
prices, a customer would not have an incentive to establish a brokerage account, or obtain any other product, that
the customer did not want in order to obtain the discount. For this reason, the Board does not believe that the proposed
rule would allow coercive or anticompetitive practices, or otherwise contravene the purposes of section 106.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's anti-tying regulation currently conditions all regulatory exceptions on all products involved in the
tying arrangement being separately available for purchase, and that condition would apply to the proposed exception.
The Board has sought comment on an amendment to this condition providing that products be separately available for
purchase ``at competitive prices.'' 59 FR 39709 (August 4, 1994).

Under antitrust precedent, concerns over tying arrangements are substantially reduced where the buyer is free to

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace areas at Mobile, AL; Fort Myers, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Columbus,
GA; Savannah, GA and Greer, SC. Presently, these areas are designated as Class C airspace when the associated control
tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers at these locations
are closed. The intended effect of the action is to be provided adequate Class E Airspace for instrument flight rule
(IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Mobile, AL; Fort Myers, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Columbus, GA; Savannah, GA and Greer, SC. Currently, this
airspace is designated Class C when the associated control tower is in operation at these locations. Controlled airspace
to the surface is needed when the control towers are closed at Mobile, AL; Fort Myers, FL; Tallahassee, FL; Columbus,
GA; Savannah, GA and Greer, SC. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR
operations at these airports when these control towers are closed. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from above the surface are published
in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994 and effective September 16, 1994 which is incorporated by
reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1994. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and
to alter various jet routes in the Miami, FL, area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew rendered the Biscayne Bay, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) inoperative.
The Biscayne Bay VOR was a navigational aid serving air traffic in the Miami terminal airspace. Consequently, several
of the jet routes previously based on the Biscayne Bay Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range had to be realigned
with other navigational aids. The Virginia Key VOR/DME is being commissioned to replace the Biscayne Bay VORTAC to
support the air traffic operations in the Miami, FL, area. Commissioning of the new, Virginia Key VOR/DME, navigational
aid will necessitate the realignment of existing routes. Additionally, the establishment of several new jet routes
is necessary to provide additional support for air traffic operations in the Miami area. Jet routes are published
in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore - (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ICAO Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As part of this proposal relate to navigable airspace outside the United States, this notice is submitted in accordance
with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Standards and Recommended Practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicability of International Standards and Recommended Practices by the Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service,
FAA, in areas outside domestic airspace of the United States is governed by Article 12 of, and Annex 11 to, the Convention
on International Civil Aviation, which pertains to the establishment of air navigational facilities and services
necessary to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of civil air traffic. Their purpose is to ensure that
civil aircraft operations on international air routes is carried out under uniform conditions designed to improve
the safety and efficiency of air operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The International Standards and Recommended Practices in Annex 11 apply in those parts of the airspace under the jurisdiction
of a contracting state, derived from ICAO, wherein air traffic services are provided and also whenever a contracting
state accepts the responsibility of providing air traffic services over high seas or in airspace of undetermined
sovereignty. A contracting state accepting such responsibility may apply the International Standards and Recommended
Practices in a manner consistent with that adopted for airspace under its domestic jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, 1944, state aircraft are
exempt from the provisions of Annex 11 and its Standards and Recommended Practices. As a contracting state, the United
States agreed by Article 3(d) that its state aircraft will be operated in international airspace with due regard for
the safety of civil aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action involves, in part, the designation of navigable airspace outside the United States, the Administrator
is consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 10854.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and
alter various Federal airways in the Miami, FL, area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew rendered the Biscayne Bay, FL, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) inoperative.
Biscayne Bay VOR was a significant navigational aid serving air traffic in the Miami terminal airspace. Consequently,
several of the airways previously based, in part, on the Biscayne Bay VOR had to be realigned with other navigational
aids. The Virginia Key VOR/DME is being commissioned to replace the Biscayne Bay VORTAC to support the air traffic
operations in the Miami, FL, area. Commissioning of the new, Virginia Key VOR/DME, navigational aid will necessitate
the realignment of existing routes. Also, a new airway would be established to provide additional support for air
traffic operations in the Miami area. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order
7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The
Domestic VOR Federal airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore - (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. ICAO Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this proposal relates to navigable airspace outside the United States, this notice is submitted in accordance
with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) International Standards and Recommended Practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicability of International Standards and Recommended Practices by the Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service,
FAA, in areas outside domestic airspace of the United States is governed by Article 12 of, and Annex 11 to, the Convention
on International Civil Aviation, which pertains to the establishment of air navigational facilities and services
necessary to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of civil air traffic. Their purpose is to ensure that
civil aircraft operations on international air routes is carried out under uniform conditions designed to improve
the safety and efficiency of air operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The International Standards and Recommended Practices in Annex 11 apply in those parts of the airspace under the jurisdiction
of a contracting state, derived from ICAO, wherein air traffic services are provided and also whenever a contracting
state accepts the responsibility of providing air traffic services over high seas or in airspace of undetermined
sovereignty. A contracting state accepting such responsibility may apply the International Standards and Recommended
Practices in a manner consistent with that adopted for airspace under its domestic jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, 1944, state aircraft are
exempt from the provisions of Annex 11 and its Standards and Recommended Practices. As a contracting state, the United
States agreed by Article 3(d) that its state aircraft will be operated in international airspace with due regard for
the safety of civil aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action involves, in part, the designation of navigable airspace outside the United States, the Administrator
is consulting with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 10854.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1994, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;305 was enacted and requires that the FAA conduct a study on the availability,
effectiveness, cost, and usefulness of restraint systems that may offer protection to children, who presently do
not use child restraint systems and who are presently carried on the laps of adults, aboard air carrier aircraft. The
report to Congress is due February 23, 1995. This document requests comments from the public on the issues surrounding
child restraint systems.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
United States air carriers have a superb safety record that has continued to improve over time and now ranks among the
best in the world. The risk of injury or death when traveling on an airline is low. Air carrier accidents are infrequent.
Even identifying the causes of these accidents (e.g., severe inflight turbulence) requires thorough and wide-ranging
research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children under the age of two (infants) are permitted to travel aboard airlines on the laps of their parents, guardians,
or attendants. Air carriers decide whether to charge for the transportation of infants who are held on adult laps.
Infants traveling in this manner, however, are not secured by any safety/restraint systems. In the rare event of a
crash or rapid aircraft movements such as those caused by severe in-flight turbulence, forces may be too great for
the accompanying adult, guardian, or attendant to protect the infant from injury. In these circumstances, infants
are at higher risk of death or injury than all other travelers who must fasten safety belts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infants may also be placed in acceptable child/infant safety seats. However, most air carriers require that a ticket
be purchased for those children under two in order to reserve a seat to which the safety seat can be attached. The added
ticket cost, and the generally perceived low rate of accidents and injuries, results in many parents, guardians or
attendants opting to hold infants in their laps. The alternative of incurring an added cost to reserve a seat for use
with an infant safety seat may divert some air travelers to other less costly modes of transportation. Infants and
adults may be at a higher risk of death or injury when traveling in alternative modes than if they flew.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress, in Public Law 103&hyph;305, amended the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982. This amendment directs
the FAA to conduct a study of child restraint systems on air carrier aircraft. The study is due to Congress on February
23, 1995. The purpose of this study is to determine the availability, effectiveness, cost, and usefulness of restraint
systems that may offer protection to a child, carried in the lap of an adult aboard an air carrier aircraft or provide
for the attachment of a child restraint device to the aircraft. Congress has directed the FAA to study the following
issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The direct cost to families of requiring air carriers to provide restraint systems and requiring infants to use
them, including whether airlines will charge a fare for use of seats containing restraining systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The impact on air carrier aircraft passenger volume by requiring use of infant restraint systems, including whether
families will choose to travel to destinations by other means, including automobiles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The impact on fatalities and fatality rates of infants and adults using airplanes, automobiles, and other modes
of transportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The efficacy of infant restraints currently marketed as able to be used for air carrier aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are at least four additional issues that are related to the Congressional issues described above:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. What cost might airlines incur if the use of child safety seats was required by regulation? There are several subordinate
issues related to cost. For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Would air carriers provide child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) What would it cost air carriers to purchase and maintain child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) How often would child safety seats have to be replaced?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How many times annually would child safety seats be used on air carrier aircraft? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) How many child safety seats would be purchased during a year by air carriers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For a family traveling with infants, what is the price elasticity of demand for air travel? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) What fares doe air carriers now charge for infants currently seated in child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If parents had to purchase a ticket for their child under the age of two and the price of the seats on their flight of
choice was such that their only alternatives would be to (1) drive or (2) fly paying discount fares during off-peak
hours (or a non-direct flight), which alternative would they choose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is there a difference in the elasticity of short versus long trips_(less than 300 miles and 300 miles or greater)?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Is 300 miles the appropriate demarcation for a short versus a long trip for a family traveling with infants? What,
if any, is a relevant demarcation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) What is the cross-price elasticity of demand for air and automobile travel for families traveling with infants?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What are the profiles of families with infants who drive? What are the profiles of families with infants who fly?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) How many infants are enplaned annually aboard domestic air carriers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How many infants would be represented in an average size family that flies? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) What is the average number of individuals in a family that flies? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How many families fly annually? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Of those families with infants who fly, what percent of families currently use child safety seats? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What are the infant and adult mortality rates for air travel, automobile travel, and other modes of transportation?
There are several subordinate issues related to mortality rates. For example:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) What is the non-infant automobile passenger fatality, serious injury, and minor injury incidence rate for families
with infants traveling by automobile? How does this incidence rate compare with those of families traveling by air?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How does the automobile accident rate for parents and guardians of infants compare with the automobile accident
rate for the general population?

With regard to the issue of the efficacy of infant restraints, the FAA has completed a study entitled ``The Performance
of Child Restraint Devices in Transport Airplane Passenger Seats.'' A notice of availability was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 27, 1994 (59 FR 49276). The FAA is continuing to study child restraint systems and to work with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop revised standards for child safety seat testing and labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will be seeking data from some individually selected air carriers, air taxis, and commercial operators or
their representatives concerning anticipated pricing policies if child safety seats are mandated for infants.
This data is needed to respond to the Congressional request for a report and would constitute competitive commercial
information. To avoid any improper exchange of competitive price or marketing information the FAA will maintain
the confidentiality of such information. Raw data of this nature will not be disclosed; rather, any presentation
of such data will be aggregated to avoid any competitive concerns.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We propose to revise the requirements of the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) regulations
regarding the certifications required on disability determination forms. Determinations of disability are generally
made by disability determination services (DDS), which are agencies of each State. Present regulations require
that, unless the disability determination is made by a State agency disability hearing officer, disability determinations
made by a DDS will be made by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State agency disability examiner,
including those in which the determination is made on technical, non-medical, rather than medical, grounds. We propose
to remove the requirement that a medical or psychological consultant make the determination jointly with the disability
examiner when there is no medical evidence to be evaluated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Social Security Act (the Act) provides, in title II, for the payment of disability benefits to individuals insured
under the Act. Title II also provides for the payment of child's insurance benefits based on disability and widow's
and widower's insurance benefits for disabled widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses of insured individuals.
In addition, the Act provides, in title XVI, for SSI payments to persons who are aged, blind, or disabled and who have
limited income and resources. For adults under both the title II and title XVI programs and for persons claiming child's
insurance benefits based on disability under the title II program, ``disability'' means the inability to engage
in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable impairment. For a child under age 18 claiming
SSI benefits based on disability, ``disability'' means that the child's impairment(s) is of comparable severity
to one that would disable an adult (i.e., the impairment(s) substantially reduces the child's ability to function
independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner such that the child's impairment(s)
and resulting limitations are comparable to those that would disable an adult). Under both title II and title XVI,
disability must be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected
to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 404.1503 and 416.903 of the Social Security Administration's regulations provide that State agencies
make disability and blindness determinations for the Secretary of Health and Human Services for most persons living
in the State. Sections 404.1615(c) and 416.1015(c) of the regulations provide that disability determinations will
be made by either: (1) A State agency medical or psychological consultant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a State agency disability examiner or (2) a State agency disability hearing officer. Sections 404.1615(e) and 416.1015(e)
of the regulations require the State agency to certify each determination of disability to the Social Security Administration
(SSA) on forms provided by SSA. The term ``determination of disability'' is defined in &sect;&sect;404.1602 and
416.1002 of the regulations to mean one or more of the following decisions: whether or not a person is under a disability;
the date a person's disability began; or the date a person's disability ended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a disability determination is made jointly by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State
agency disability examiner, the medical or psychological consultant is responsible for the medical portion of the
determination and the disability examiner is responsible for the remainder of the determination. Under our current
procedures, both the disability examiner and the medical or psychological consultant must certify the determination
on forms which we provide as required in the regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some instances, however, the requirement for the medical or psychological consultant's certification is unnecessary
because the decision is made on technical, non-medical grounds alone, without consideration of any medical evidence.
Many medical and psychological consultants who work with the State agencies do so on a part-time basis and are not always
available to sign disability determination forms. This can result in delays of cases that are otherwise complete
because no medical input or expertise is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This happens, for example, when an individual who has no history of medical treatment or examination_and, hence,
no existing medical records that we can obtain_refuses to attend a consultative examination purchased at our expense.
In such a case, the State agency makes its determination on technical, non-medical, rather than medical, grounds.
It denies such a claim because, without the individual's cooperation, the evidence needed to determine whether the
individual is disabled cannot be obtained. Nevertheless, our current rules require that a medical or psychological
consultant sign the standard disability determination form in such a case, even though there is no medical evidence
and consequently, no medical finding can be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to address this issue by revising &sect;&sect;404.1615 and 416.1015 of the regulations to provide, in
a new paragraph (c)(2), that a State agency disability examiner alone may make the disability determination when
there is no medical evidence to be evaluated, such as when there is no existing medical evidence and the individual
refuses to attend a consultative examination. We also propose to redesignate current paragraph (c)(2), which provides
that a State agency disability hearing officer may also make disability determinations, as paragraph (c)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR&hyph;4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231,
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 0E3907 to EPA on behalf of the
Agricultural Experiment Station of California. This petition requests that the Administrator, pursuant to section
408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish a tolerance for combined
residues of the herbicide 3,5-dichloro-

per million (ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the proposed tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A 90-day feeding study with rats administered pronamide in the diet at concentrations of 0, 40, 200, 1,000, or 4,000
ppm (equivalent to 0, 2.5, 12.3, 60.0, or 254.0 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day in males; 0, 3.1, 15.0, 74.6, or
289.2 mg/kg/day in females). A systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was established at 200 ppm (12.3 mg/kg/day/male;
15 mg/kg/day/female). A systemic lowest-effect level (LEL) was established at 1,000 ppm (60.0 mg/kg/day/male;
74.6 mg/kg/day/female), based on increased liver relative weight and incidence of liver histopathology in both
sexes, decreased body/weight gain and feed consumption in females, and increased blood cholesterol level in males.
Effects observed at the high dose (4,000 ppm) include decreases in body weight/weight gain and feed consumption in
both sexes, and increases in liver-related effects and in the histopathology of the thyroid (both sexes) and anterior
pituitary (males).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 52-week chronic feeding study with dogs fed diets containing 0, 300, 875, or 1,750 ppm (equivalent to 0, 11.9, 33.1,
or 67.7 mg/kg/day in males; or 0, 11.9, 36.1, or 69.0 mg/kg/day in females) with a NOEL established at 300 ppm, based
on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase in males and thyroid weight in females, and in liver pathology in both sexes
at the 875-ppm dose level. Additional effects observed at the highest dose tested (1,750 ppm) include decreases in
body weight/feed consumption, increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase in both sexes,
increases in serum alanine aminotransferase in females, and increases in testes relative weight in males.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An 18-month carcinogenicity study with B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 0, 1,000, or 2,000 ppm (approximately
0, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day) with a dose-related increase in incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in male mice sacrificed
at 18 months. The increases in tumor rates observed at 1,000 and 2,000 ppm were statistically significant by pair-wise
comparison with the control. There were no carcinogenic effects observed in female mice under the conditions of the
study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 24-month chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 40, 200, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent
to 0, 1.73, 8.46, or 42.59 mg/kg/day/male and 0, 2.13, 10.69, or 55.09 mg/kg/day/female). The NOEL for systemic (nonneoplastic)
effects was established at 8.46 mg/kg/day/males and 10.69 mg/kg/day females, based on decreased body weight/body
weight gain and increased liver weight, as well as an increased incidence of hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy,
eosinophilic cell alterations, and thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy in both sexes at the high-dose level. Rats
fed at the high-dose level also showed an increased incidence of thyroid tumor (thyroid follicular cell adenomas)
and testicular tumor (benign testicular interstitial cell tumors) rates, which exceeded historical control ranges.
There was no progression from thyroid and testicular tumors to carcinomas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A two-generation reproduction study with rats fed diets containing 0, 40, 200, or 1,500 ppm (approximately 0, 3.0,
15.4, or 114.0 mg/kg/day/P1 males and 0, 3.2, 16.5, or 127.3 mg/kg/day/P2 males during pre-mating period; group time-weighted
average approximately 0, 4.1, 20.2, and 158.2 mg/kg/day/P1 females and 0, 4.0, 19.8, or 157.4 mg/kg/day/P2 females).
The reproductive NOEL was established at 200 ppm, based on decreased combined male/female pup weight per litter at
the 1,500-ppm dose level. A NOEL for parental systemic effects was established at 200 ppm, based on decreased body
weight and food consumption and histopathology of the liver and adrenal in both sexes, the thyroid in females, and
the anterior pituitary in males at the 1,500-ppm dose level. These effects were observed in both P1 and P2 generations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A developmental toxicity study with rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 5, 20, or 80 mg/kg/day during gestation days
7 through 19 with a developmental NOEL established at 20 mg/kg/day, based on late resorption (2 of 5 abortions at the
80 mg/kg/day dose level each showed one incidence of late resorption). The maternal NOEL was established at 20 mg/kg/day,
based on one mortality, abortions in 5 of 16 animals, body weight loss, and liver histopathology at the 80 mg/kg/day
dose level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A developmental toxicity study with rats given gavage doses of 0, 5, 20, 80, or 160 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 through
15 with no clinical signs of toxicity under the conditions of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation (Ames test), forward gene mutation (CH V79 cells), structural chromosome
aberration in vitro (CHO cells), structural chromosome aberration in vivo (mouse bone marrow cells), and UDNA synthesis
(primary hepatocytes of rats), were all negative. The results of the mutagenicity test indicate that pronamide does
not appear to be mutagenic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Pesticide Programs' Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee has classified pronamide as a Group B2 carcinogen
(a probable human carcinogen), based on the findings of two types of tumors in the rat (uncommon benign testicular
interstitial cell tumors and thyroid follicular cell adenomas) and one type (liver carcinomas) in the mouse. The
upper limit on the carcinogenic risk from dietary exposure resulting from established uses of pronamide and the proposed
use on radicchio is estimated at 4.9 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the general population. The carcinogenic risk assessment for pronamide was calculated based on a potency estimator
(Q
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 and an Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) calculated at 0.000032 mg/kg/body weight/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) is established at 0.080 mg/kg of body weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 8.46 mg/kg/day
from the rat 2-year feeding study and an uncertainty factor of 100. The ARC from established uses and the proposed use
of pronamide utilizes less than 1 percent of the RfD for the U.S. population and all subgroups of the population currently
evaluated by EPA's Dietary Risk Evaluation System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood. The residues of concern are pronamide and its metabolites
containing the 3,5-dichlorophenyl moiety. An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, is available for
enforcement purposes. The analytical method for enforcing this tolerance has been published in the Pesticide Analytical
Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat
of livestock and poultry: radicchio greens are not considered to be livestock feed items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerance established by amending
40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be established as set
forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3907/P588]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region V announces its intent to delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics
Site from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comments on this action. The NPL is appendix B of 40
CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated
pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)
as amended. This action is being taken, because all Fund-financed response actions under CERCLA have been implemented
and EPA, in consultation with the State of Minnesota, has determined that no further response is appropriate. Moreover,
EPA and the State have determined that remedial activities conducted at the site to date have been protective of public
health, welfare, and the environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics
Site from the National Priorities List (NPL), appendix B to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency
Plan, 40 CFR part 300 (NCP), and requests comments on the proposed deletion. The EPA identifies sites which appear
to present a significant risk to public health, welfare or the environment, and maintains the NPL as the list of those
sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Superfund (Fund) financed remedial actions. Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3)
of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for additional Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely
event that conditions at the site warrant such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA will accept comments on this proposal for thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the history of this site and explains how the site meets the deletion
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. Furthermore,
deletion from the NPL does not in any way alter EPA's right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate. The NPL is designed
primarily for informational purposes and to assist in Agency management.

II. NPL Deletion Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e),
sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, USEPA will
consider, in consultation with the State, whether any of the following criteria have been met:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Boise Cascade/Onan/Medtronics Superfund Site covers 183 acres and is located in the City of Fridley in Anoka County
in the state of Minnesota. From approximately 1921 through 1961, National Pole and Treating Company and its affiliate,
Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company (M&amp;O) operated a wood treating facility at the site. Initial operations
included the use of creosote treatment of wood for the manufacture of railroad ties and utility poles. In approximately
1958, pentachlorophenol (PCP), another wood preservative, was also used for treating lumber. Wood-treating operations
ceased in early 1961. In 1964, M&amp;O merged with the Boise Cascade Corporation (Boise). Boise sold the site in 1967.
Subsequently, Medtronics, Inc. acquired 50 acres of the Boise Cascade property located to the west and south, and
Onan, Inc. acquired 133 acres of the site to the north and east. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1979, Onan began excavation for construction purposes and encountered large quantities of creosote and PCP saturated
soil. Similar deposits were subsequently discovered on the Medtronics portion of the Site. Wood-treating operations
had contaminated soils and groundwater with creosote and PCP by spillage, dripping, and wastewater disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Boise Cascade site was placed on the National Priorities List on September 21, 1984, at 49 FR 37066&hyph;37090.
In conjunction with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Boise conducted extensive soil and groundwater
investigations from 1979 through 1982. Because the Site's ownership is divided between two different companies,
Site investigations at the Boise Cascade Site were conducted separately within the individual property boundaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the Onan property the analyses verified that the major contaminants of concern were creosote derived polynuclear
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) and phenolic compounds (phenolics are also derived from PCP). The heaviest concentrations
of these substances were found on two areas where significant aspects of the tie treating process had been conducted:
(1) The area where the ties were pressure treated in the retorts; and (2) the area where the ties were left to cool and
dry after they were removed from the retorts and before they were loaded onto railroad cars for shipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven shallow monitoring wells were installed at locations to sample surficial groundwater in the coarse Fridley
Formation to determine the Glacial Drift Stratigraphy in the Site area. Heavy concentrations of PAHs were found in
the vicinity of the Retort building in an area where tanks were removed in mid-1979. A plume of PAH compounds was found
to extend to the southwest of the Retort area; however, the concentrations of PAH compounds decreased by more than
two orders of magnitude by the time the plume reached the southern boundary of the Onan property, which was likely due
to the attenuation of the PAH compound in the soil system. Phenolics were not present in the samples from the shallow
groundwater beneath the Onan property at concentrations above the detection limits with the one exception of 4-methylphenol
which was detected in the Retort area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hillside sand aquifer was sampled and found to contain insignificant levels of PAHs and no phenolics compounds.
An eight inch diameter bedrock well, uncovered in 1979 during earth moving activities, was investigated. Approximately
two feet of creosote sludge was discovered at the bottom of the well. All contaminated soil was excavated and placed
in a vault formed by slurry wall and a cap consisting of clean soil and a vegetative cover was constructed over the vault.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The direction of groundwater movement in the surficial groundwater system in the upper portion of the Fridley Formation
beneath the Onan property is southwesterly toward Rice and Norton Creeks. Water and sediment samples were collected
from two monitoring stations along Norton Creek and from three monitoring stations along Rice Creek. PAH samples
were measured above detection limits in the surface water and sediment samples from all sampling stations on Rice
and Norton Creeks, including stations upstream of the site, therefore it was impossible to attribute an impact from
the Site to the Creeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Medtronic Property the waste water treatment lagoons were utilized for disposal of the waste waters generated
by operations. The waste waters contained quantities of creosote and PCP which subsequently contaminated soils
and groundwater beneath the primary and secondary wastewater treatment lagoons and a trench leading to the lagoons.
Both the trench and the lagoons were located on the Medtronics portion of the site, east of Old Central Avenue. Eight
shallow soil borings were installed along the waste water trench and around the primary and secondary waste water
treatment lagoons. High levels of PAHs and heterocyclics were found. Additionally, about 5000 gallons of free oil
were discovered in the vicinity of the primary waste water lagoon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the Site Investigations, remediation at the Boise Cascade Site was conducted separately within the individual
property boundaries. The following remedial actions were implemented at the Site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A slurry wall containment system was constructed around the former retort building. Visually contaminated soil
was excavated and placed in a vault formed by a slurry wall, and a cap was constructed over the vault. The excavated areas
were backfilled with clean soil. A subdrain system was installed in the former loading area to remove groundwater
from the coarse Fridley Formation and discharge it into the City of Fridley sanitary sewer system. A long-term monitoring
of groundwater, surface water, and air quality has been ongoing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Medtronics Property on the basis of the investigations above, Boise and Medtronics companies developed a Remedial
Action Plan (RAP) to excavate and dispose of visibly contaminated soils on the Medtronics portion of the site. The
following Remedial Actions were implemented at the Site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the visibly contaminated soil in the two wastewater lagoons and in the trench that was used to convey wastewater
from the retort to the lagoons were excavated and disposed of in a hazardous waste facility that had interim status
pursuant to RCRA. Excavated areas were backfilled with clean soil. Groundwater that was in contact with and directly
beneath contaminated soil was collected, treated and disposed of into the City of Fridley sanitary sewer system.
About 5000 gallons of free oil discovered in the vicinity of the primary wastewater lagoon was collected and disposed
offsite. Long-term monitoring of groundwater, surface water, sediments, and air quality has been ongoing. A final
Close Out Report which documents completion of Site construction, was signed on September 30, 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By decision served August 23, 1994 (59 FR 43529, August 24, 1994), the Commission sought public comment by September
23, 1994, on a proposal to exempt partially from regulation the rail transportation of certain non-ferrous recyclables.
The due date for comments was subsequently extended to October 24, 1994 (59 FR 47292, September 15, 1994). The Association
of American Railroads and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc., require additional time to prepare
and coordinate the witness statements and the joint comments and request an extension of the due date until November
7, 1994. The request is reasonable; therefore, the extension will be granted.

Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as amended, requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist
or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial information to demonstrate that the petitioned
action may be warranted. This finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time the finding
is made. To the maximum extent practicable, the finding shall be made within 90 days following receipt of the petition
and promptly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Service must also commence a timely status review of the petitioned species if its accompanying information
results in a positive finding. Following a positive 90-day finding, Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Service
to make a 12-month finding as to whether the petitioned action is:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Not warranted,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Warranted; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Warranted but precluded by other higher priority listing proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 15, 1994, the Service received a petition from Ms. Nancy Fraser Williams on behalf of the Rock Creek Owners'
Association, Gainesville, Florida. The petition requests that Says' spiketail dragonfly, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cordulegaster sayi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), be listed as an endangered species. It states that a portion of a forested ravine and its riparian corridor owned
by the Rock Creek residential housing subdivision is essentially the species' only known breeding grounds. The petitioners
contend that a proposed municipal storm water retention project within the corridor's floodplain, described as
the Possum Branch of Hogtown Creek, would gravely endanger the existing breeding sites of this extremely rare dragonfly
and virtually wipe out the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Westfall (unpublished) provides collection information for Say's spiketail from seven localities in northern
Florida and one specific site from southeastern Georgia. Five of these sites are located on public land, with occurrence
based on fewer than two dozen specimens. Rock Creek, named in the petition, is the best studied and most productive
of the known collection sites. Alabama may be added to the range if identification of an adult female collected in 1994
from Conecuh National Forest is verified (Mr. Bill Mauffray, International Odonate Research Institute, pers. comm.,
1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Say's spiketail was included as a candidate for listing in the Service's invertebrate notice of review for animals
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664) and is comprehensive animal notices of review published January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554) and
November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). The dragonfly was included in the first notice as a category 1 candidate for listing,
but as a category 2 candidate in subsequent notices. A category 1 taxon is one for which the Service has available enough
substantial information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support a proposal to list it as endangered
or threatened. A category 2 taxon is one for which information in possession of the Service indicates that proposing
to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability
and threat are not currently available to support a proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information presented in the petition supports the Service's previous decision to consider this species as a
category 2 listing candidate as defined above. At the time the petition was received, the Service was aware of and investigating
the proposed floodwater relief project and its potential impact on Say's spiketail. The hydrologic model for the
project (Westfall and Mauffray 1994) predicted the proposed flood control structure would increase depth of inundation
for 10-year and 25-year storm events by approximately 2 and 3 feet, respectively. All but one of nine seepage transects
included in the project's biological assessment would be completely inundated during any 10-year event. The seep
heads and a few feet of their runs in four of the nine sampled seeps would not be totally inundated by a 10-year flood under
the existing pre-project conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One such 10-year event did occur in March 1993. The only larvae collected after this flood were found at three completely
inundated seeps (Westfall and Mauffray, 1994). Less than 10 percent of the previous seasons' adult total was observed
during a 3-week period in 1993. During the 1994 flight season, however, 12 adults were observed in a single day at Rock
Creek, indicating recovery from any adverse effects from flooding. It appears that larvae may not be displayed by
significant flooding and are able to survive these episodes at their original locations.

A recent review of category 2 insects in the southeast region (Schweitzer 1989) recommended a very high status survey
priority for Say's spiketail. The Service concurs with this recommendation and plans to fund a survey within the near
future to better determine current distribution and status. However, the service does not anticipate this survey
will be completed in time for the 12-month finding on this petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) is publishing proposed regulations
governing retirement benefits court orders. The proposed regulations contain a number of procedural changes which
reflect the Board's experience in processing retirement benefits court orders, as well as changes in Federal tax
law. The proposed regulations will establish a new Part in the Code of Federal Regulations replacing existing regulations
regarding court orders.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board administers the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which was established by the Federal Employees' Retirement
System Act of 1986 (FERSA), Pub. L. 99&hyph;335. The provisions governing the TSP are codified primarily in subchapters
III and VII of Chapter 84 of Title 5, United States Code. The TSP is a tax-deferred retirement savings plan for Federal
employees that is similar to cash or deferred arrangements established under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Sums in a TSP participant's account are held in trust for that participant. 5 U.S.C. 8437(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 8467(a), payments from the TSP that would otherwise be made to a TSP participant shall be paid ``to another
person if and to the extent that the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment or legal separation, or the terms of
any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment,
or legal separation expressly provide.'' A related provision, 5 U.S.C. 8435(d), states that an election or change
of election of TSP benefits shall not be effective to the extent that it would conflict with ``a court decree of divorce,
annulment or legal separation *&blank;*&blank;* or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement
incident to such decree *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The TSP need only honor court orders or decrees meeting the requirements
of 5 U.S.C. 8467(a) and 8435(d) if the Executive Director receives proper notice of the order before disbursement
of the participant's account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations address only court orders and decrees described in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467. Such orders
and decrees are referred to in the proposed regulations as ``retirement benefits court orders.'' These are to be distinguished
from ``alimony and child support orders,'' which are governed by 5 U.S.C. 8437(e)(3). Proposed regulations governing
alimony and child support orders will be promulgated in a separate subpart of Part 1653. The current proposed regulations,
when effective, will supersede the interim regulations presently found at 5 CFR 1650.27 to 1650.43.

Section 1653.1 states the purpose of the proposed regulations. The procedures set forth in the regulations will be
applied in determining whether the Board must honor orders purporting to constitute retirement benefits court orders
described in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467. The regulations also establish procedures for calculation and payment of
awards pursuant to qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(a) sets forth the general rule that only ``qualifying'' retirement benefits court orders will be
honored. If an order is determined not to be qualifying, it will not affect the participant's account. TSP participants
involved in divorce proceedings, and their representatives, are encouraged to read the TSP publication, ``Information
About Court Orders,'' to obtain useful information for drafting and submitting court orders that will be deemed qualifying
under the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1653.2(b) sets forth the requirements for a court order to be ``qualifying.'' Section 1653.2(b)(1) describes
the type of legal document that can be a qualifying order. The first sentence is designed to clarify that the language
``court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation,'' as used in both 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467 has been interpreted
by the Board to mean ``a court decree of divorce, a court decree of annulment, or a court decree of legal separation.''
In order to have a qualifying court order, a court must be involved. A legal separation agreement that has not been approved
by a court, for example, is not a ``court decree of legal separation,'' and therefore cannot constitute a qualifying
court order. Also, a property settlement agreement must be court-approved in order to be qualifying. This means that
the court's approval must be demonstrated on the face of the document or in an accompanying court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second sentence of &sect;1653.2(b)(1) is designed to make it clear that a ``court order or court-approved property
settlement agreement incident to [a decree of divorce, of annulment or of legal separation]'' may occur at any stage
of the proceeding, not just after the entry of a final decree of divorce, of annulment or of legal separation. For example,
courts often issue orders during a divorce proceeding in order to preserve the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in anticipation of a final decree dividing the property of the parties. The proposed regulations also allow for the
possibility that an order serving a function other than preservation of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 could be deemed ``incident to'' a decree that has not yet been entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Board receives an otherwise valid order awarding a former spouse a portion of a TSP account, but prior to payment
receives a valid amended order changing the earlier award, the amended order will be honored. However, under no circumstances
will the Board accept the return to the TSP of funds that have been properly paid pursuant to an earlier order, even if
a subsequent order would dictate such a result. The processing of multiple court orders is addressed in &sect;1653.3(k).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(b)(2) addresses the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 8435(d)(2)(A) that a court order must ``expressly relate''
to a participant's TSP account and the requirement in 5 U.S.C. 8467 that the court order must ``expressly provide''
for payment to someone other than the participant. For an order to be honored under either provision, the order must
unambiguously address the TSP account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(b)(2)(i) requires that an order must clearly and specifically deal with a participant's TSP account.
It is not sufficient to use generic language that is arguably broad enough to include the TSP. For example, an order
that states, ``Former Spouse is awarded 50% of all of Participant's Federal retirement benefits'' would not be language
that expressly relates to the TSP, even though the TSP is a Federal retirement benefit. The clearest and most effective
way to ensure that an order is honored is to actually name the Thrift Savings Plan; parties to divorce actions are encouraged
to attempt to obtain such specific language in their orders. However, &sect;1653.2(b)(2)(ii) makes it clear that,
even if the Thrift Savings Plan is identified by name, the order must not contain language that is inconsistent with
the division of a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan, such as the TSP, in which the participant
has an individual account. References to ``benefit formulas,'' ``accrued benefits,'' or ``eventual benefits''
may or may not be acceptable in context, because such terms have the potential to raise questions as to whether the order
is truly dealing specifically with the TSP account as opposed to simply including the TSP among other retirement benefits
to which the participant may be entitled. Since use of such terms may lead the Board to reject an order as not expressly
relating to the TSP account, these terms should be avoided in favor of references to the ``TSP account'' or ``TSP account
balance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(b)(3) further implements the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 8467 that a payment pursuant to a court order
must be expressly provided for in the order. If the order requires a payment from the TSP account, it must either award
a specific dollar amount or divide the participant's account balance by applying a fraction, a percentage, or a formula
that yields a mathematically possible result. For example, a formula where the numerator is larger than the denominator
and therefore yields an amount greater than the entire account balance is not acceptable. All of the variables for
the formula must also be set forth in the order or must be available through reference to Government employment records.
The dollar amount, percentage, fraction or variables used must be clearly determinable; they cannot be qualified
by terms such as ``approximately.'' The order may or may not provide for interest or earnings to be added to the amount
of the award, but any award of earnings must also be clearly determinable. The order may also award a survivor annuity
under 5 U.S.C. 8435(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;1653.2(b)(4), an order will only be deemed qualifying if it calls for payment to the spouse, former spouse,
attorney for the spouse or former spouse, dependent children of the participant, other dependents of the participant,
or the attorney for the participant's dependent children or other dependents. Payment cannot be made to the participant
or to others, such as credit card companies, mortgage lenders, or other creditors of the parties to the divorce. The
TSP is a retirement savings plan, and the occasion of a divorce should not be a general opportunity for the participant
to obtain access to his or her account or for the parties to use retirement savings to liquidate their general debts.
In this context, payment to the attorney for the participant is tantamount to a payment to the participant, since the
participant owes a debt to the attorney. Thus, the proposed rules would not permit such a payment. In contrast, it is
permissible for the court to award a payment from the TSP account to the attorney representing the spouse/former spouse
or dependent children or other dependents for legal fees incurred in connection with the divorce, because direct
payments to the spouse/former spouse or dependent children or other dependents are also permissible. The Board will
not honor an order asking for payment to be made jointly, such as to the former spouse and his or her children. Rather,
the order should separately specify the award to be made to each person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1653.2(c) specifically states that certain orders are not qualifying. Section 1653.2(c)(1) provides that
an order relating only to money that is not vested (under 5 U.S.C. 8432(g)) shall not be deemed a qualifying order unless
the money will become vested within 90 days of receipt of the order if the participant remains in Federal employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(c)(2) represents a significant departure from current rules for processing court orders. Under
current rules the Board has been paying court orders as soon as the amount of the award can be calculated, even where
the order calls for a payment at a later date. In cases where a dollar amount is awarded and the order specifies that payment
is to be made upon a date in the future, that dollar amount has been paid immediately. On the other hand, where the amount
of the award is based on a percentage of the account balance as of a date in the future (such as the participant's separation
from Federal Government employment or some other specified date), or is based on a percentage determined by a formula
containing variables that cannot be determined until a date in the future, the Board's current procedures have called
for the order to be retained by the Board so that payment could be made at the appropriate time in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;1653.2(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rules, orders requiring payment at a future specified date will not
be considered qualifying orders unless two requirements are met. First, it must be currently possible to calculate
the amount of the entitlement. Second, the award must provide for interest or earnings to be paid on the amount of the
award until the date of payment. If both of these requirements are met, the order will be considered qualifying. However,
payment will be made not at the future date specified in the order, but rather will be made currently after following
the procedures of &sect;1653.5. The rationale for this limited exception to the general rule that orders requiring
future payment will be rejected is that, where the amount of the award can currently be calculated and the order calls
for interest or earnings, a payment of that amount currently is the economic equivalent of a payment of the same amount
plus earnings at a future date. However, under the proposed regulations there will be no case in which the Board will
hold orders until a future date specified by a court for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(c)(2)(ii) is designed to clarify that is not necessary for the exact amount of the award to be determinable
upon receipt of the order by the Board. An order may be qualifying if it provides for a current payment to be calculated
as of the date of payment. The Board recognizes that the procedures set forth in the proposed regulations will often
require a few months between the receipt of the order by the Board and the payment of the account. Orders will not be deemed
non-qualifying future orders merely because the amount of the award cannot be calculated until a payment date that
will invariably be later than the date of receipt of the order by the Board. For example, an order that incorporates
a formula using a variable such as the number of months of the participant's Federal employment as of the date of payment
would not be considered a non-qualifying future order, even though the length of the participant's Federal service
will have to be determined as of the date of payment, which is likely to be a few months after the Board's receipt of the
order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.2(d) defines the term ``former spouse'' as used in the proposed regulations, by adopting the definition
contained in 5 U.S.C. 8401(12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3 sets forth procedures for reviewing retirement benefits court orders. Section 1653.3(a) provides
that the Board will process court orders in accordances with applicable Federal law, namely FERSA and the Board's
regulations. The Board's processing of court orders is not controlled by the procedures of the state divorce courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(a) also makes it clear that the Board cannot be made a party to the underlying divorce action and thereby
be subject to the jurisdiction of the court handling the divorce proceeding. The Board is a Federal agency which, under
the doctrine of sovereign immunity, is not subject to suit in state court absent specific statutory authorization.
Therefore, legal process to join the Board as a party to a divorce proceeding will not be honored. Parties to a divorce
must, without the Board's participation in the proceeding, obtain from the court an appropriate order and then submit
that order to the Board for a determination as to whether it is a qualifying order. To the extent there is any dispute
about the Board's actions concerning a court order, the matter must be resolved in Federal court under 5 U.S.C. 8477,
not in state court.

Section 1653.3(b) provides the address for the TSP recordkeeper to which court orders should be sent for processing.
Receipt by the recordkeeper is deemed receipt by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(c) provides the general rule that the Board will ``freeze'' the account of a TSP participant for whom
a document has been received that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order. When an account is frozen,
the participant may not withdraw the account or obtain a loan from the account. The freeze is intended to ensure that
the participant may not defeat the purposes of a court order by removing the funds from the account while the Board is
conducting its review of what may turn out to be a valid order. Both 5 U.S.C. 8435(d) and 8467 indicate that the Executive
Director may not make payments to the participant after receiving a qualifying court order until the court order has
been complied with.

Section 1653.3(d) lists certain types of documents that the Board views as not even purporting to constitute qualifying
retirement benefits court orders. Therefore, these documents will be rejected without substantive review and no
freeze will be placed on the account. Section 1653.3(d)(1) provides that an order will be rejected if it fails to indicate
on its face that it has been issued or approved by a court, unless an accompanying document plainly establishes that
the order was approved or issued by a court. An unsigned order will be rejected under this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(d)(2) provides that an order will be rejected where the account has been closed, which may have occurred
either because the participant withdrew his or her account or because the entire account was paid pursuant to an earlier
court order. Similarly, because FERSA was enacted on June 6, 1986, court orders entered before that date cannot ``expressly
relate'' to a TSP account, since the court could not have contemplated the existence of a TSP account. Accordingly,
under &sect;1653.3(d)(3), such orders will be rejected without review. Court orders awarding funds in the TSP account
only to the participant (&sect;1653.3(d)(4)) and court orders failing to make any mention of any retirement benefits
(&sect;1653.3(d)(5)) will also be rejected without substantive review and without freezing the account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1653.3(e) and (f) require a court order to be either an original or copy of a complete court order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a court order is not complete, the parties will be given 30 days to submit a complete document. If it is not received
within 30 days, the account will be unfrozen and the order will not be reviewed further. However, if the incomplete
order does not include a signature or other indication that it was properly issued or approved by a court, then it will
be rejected under &sect;1653.3(d)(1) without a 30-day period for resubmission.

Sections 1653.3 (g) and (h) require the Board to determine whether court orders accepted for review under this subpart
constitute qualifying orders and to provide an explanation of the decision. If the order is found to be qualifying,
the decision will state the effect of the order on the TSP account of the participant. In many cases, the effect of a final
divorce decree will be a payment from the participant's account to the spouse of former spouse. In the case of a preliminary
order, the effect is often maintenance of a freeze on the account until a further court order is received by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current Board procedures, the Board's decisions provide a 30-day appeal period for the parties to request an
administrative review of the decision by the Executive Director. Section 1653.3(i) of the proposed regulations
eliminates that appeal period and makes the Board's initial decision the final administrative action. In the Board's
experience, the appeal period has been used primarily as a time for seeking from the divorce court a new order to supersede
the earlier order, rather than to raise substantive issues relating to the Board's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that it is appropriate for the divorce court, rather than the Board, to clarify any question concerning
the meaning of the order. Elimination of the appeal period will not, however, eliminate any opportunity for the parties
to return to the divorce court for an amended order, since &sect;1653.5(a) provides that even after a determination
that an order awards a portion of a TSP account, payment cannot be made until at least 30 days after appropriate tax notification
has been provided. Similarly, if the Board determines that an order is not qualifying, &sect;1653.3(j)(4) provides
that the account will remain frozen for 45 days from the date of the Board's determination. Thus, the spouse or former
spouse is protected against disbursement of a loan or withdrawal to the participant during the 45-day period, and
may seek a new order from the divorce court during that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(j) describes when a freeze imposed under &sect;1653.3(c) will be removed. Section 1653.3(j)(1)
reiterates the provision in paragraph (f) that if the Board receives an incomplete order the parties will be notified
that a complete document must be received within 30 days. If it is not received within that time, the freeze will be removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(j)(2) provides that, where a qualifying order precludes disbursements from the participant's account,
the freeze will remain on the account until the order is either superseded or vacated by a subsequent order of the court.
Of course, if the subsequent order itself requires freezing the account, then the account will not be unfrozen. A common
situation involves a preliminary order entered to preserve the status quo by precluding the participant from obtaining
a loan or withdrawal from his or her account while the divorce proceedings are pending. The court then enters a final
divorce decree, which dissolves the preliminary order but also includes an award of a portion of the TSP account to
the former spouse. Because the final divorce decree will itself require that the account be frozen, the freeze will
remain on the account until payment of the former spouse's share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.(j)(3) provides that, where it is determined that an order makes an award of a portion of a TSP account,
the freeze will be removed upon payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in connection with the elimination of the appeal period &sect;1653.3(j)(4) provides that, where the
Board determines that an order is not qualifying, the account will remain frozen for 45 days after that determination.
This enables the parties to seek and submit to the Board a new, qualifying order from the divorce court, without concern
that the participant may withdraw or borrow from his or her account during the 45-day period. Alternatively, a party
may seek to challenge the Board's determination in Federal court. The freeze may be removed sooner than the expiration
of the 45-day period only upon written agreement from both parties to the divorce proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(k) provides the rules for processing multiple court orders. Section 1653.3(k)(1) provides that,
where there are conflicting orders arising from the same divorce proceeding and involving the same spouse of former
spouse, the order bearing the latest date will supersede any earlier orders, regardless of the dates on which they
are received by the Board. The date will be determined by using the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court
or the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, if the order does not show a date entered. If the order does not
indicate a date entered or filed, the date the order was signed by the judge will be used. Since 5 U.S.C. 8467(a) provides
that ``[a]ny payment under this subsection to a person bars recovery by any other person,'' the general rule set forth
in &sect;1643.3(k)(1) obviously cannot be applied if payment on the first order received has already been made before
the Board receives a later order that would have superseded the first order. Moreover, consistent with the last sentence
of &sect;1653.2(b)(1), no court order will be honored to the extent that doing so would require the Board to accept
the return of money already properly paid pursuant to another order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.3(k)(2) provides that where there are conflicting orders involving different spouses of former spouses,
the order with the earliest date (determined in the same manner as under &sect;1653.3(k)(1)) will be given priority
(again, unless payment on the first order received has already been made). Any payments from the account will be made
first based on the order bearing the earliest date, and proceeding through and additional orders until the account
is exhausted. It is presumed that the earliest order established rights for the spouse or former spouse named in that
order which cannot be affected by subsequent orders in different cases in which the first spouse is not a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4 sets forth rules for calculation of the amount of an entitlement. TSP accounts are valued once a month
as of the last day of the month. Under &sect;1653.4(a), if the date or event specified in the order for calculating the
award falls on any day except the last day of the month, the account balance on which the amount of the entitlement is
based is determined as of the last day of the previous month. Unless otherwise provided by the court order, any outstanding
loan balance as of the end of the month used for calculating the entitlement will be included in the account balance
for this calculation. If the date or event specified in the order falls on the last day of a month, the account balance
is determined as of that day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The actual month-end account balance used to calculate the entitlement must be adjusted by transactions which are
processed before the payment is processed but which relate to the period on or before the month-end used for the calculation.
For example, assume that in March 1995 the Board receives a qualifying court order awarding the former spouse one-half
of the participant's account balance as of the end of February 1995. In May 1995, the Board processes an adjustment
record received from the participant's employing agency which removes from the account $100 that was determined
by the agency to be an excess contribution erroneously made by the agency in January 1995. If payment pursuant to the
court order is made in July 1995, the amount paid would be computed based on the February 1995 month-end account balance,
minus the $100 which was removed from the account in May 1995 but which related to the period prior to the February month-end
computation date. On the other hand, if the adjustment record was for an erroneous contribution made in April 1995,
then the February balance would be used in the calculation of the former spouse's award without reduction for the $100
adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4(b) provides that, where the award does not cite a specific date or event, the entitlement will be calculated
based on the month-end balance on or immediately preceding the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or
the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, if the order does not show a date entered. If the order does not indicate
a date entered or filed, the date the order was signed by the judge will be used. Once the appropriate date is established,
the rules of paragraph (a) are applied as if that date had been specified in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4(c) provides that, if the court awards a specific dollar amount, but indicates that the amount awarded
must be paid out of the balance that is in the account on a certain date, the award will be for the lesser of the amount awarded
or the appropriate month-end account balance, determined and adjusted under the same rules as in paragraph (a). This
approach is based on the notion that the court has no power to award a sum that is greater than the amount in the account
on the particular date cited in the order. Also similar to the rules set forth in paragraph (a), if no date is specified
in the court order, the award will be assumed to be based on the date the order was entered, filed or signed as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;1653.4(d), unless the court order specifies otherwise, no earnings will be credited to the amount awarded.
If the court specifies that interest or earnings are to be credited, but does not specify a rate or method of calculation,
the Board will use the actual rate of return on the participant's account for the time period involved based on the funds
in which the account is invested. The participant's account may be invested in one or more of the following funds: the
Government Securities Investment (G) Fund, the Common Stock Index Investment (C) Fund, the Fixed Income Index Investment
(F) Fund. Because the earnings may be based in whole or in part on the earnings of the Common Stock Index Investment (C)
Fund or the Fixed Income Index Investment (F) Fund, and those funds may suffer losses for any given period of time, the
earnings credited to the award could be either positive or negative. The earnings calculation will begin with the
month after the month-end balance used in calculating the principal amount of the award, and will end with the month
preceding payment. If the court specifies a different method for calculating interest to be credited to the award,
that method will be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.4(e) makes it clear that under no circumstances may a participant's Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions
be paid pursuant to a court order it those funds are not vested under 5 U.S.C. 8432(g) at the time of payment. While the
entitlement may initially be calculated to include such nonvested sums for purposes of advising the parties of the
amount awarded, the amount will be recalculated excluding those sums if they have not become vested by the date of payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5 sets forth the procedures for making payments pursuant to qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
Under &sect;1653.5(a), if a qualifying order is found to require payment, an appropriate tax notification will be
provided to the payee after issuance of the Board's decision. Payment will not be made less than 30 days after issuance
of the tax notification because, under the Internal Revenue Code, the payee will often have the right to elect a transfer
to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or other eligible retirement plan, or to make a tax withholding election.
As discussed with respect to the elimination of the period for appeal of the Board's decision, this minimum waiting
period of 30 days also provides the participant an opportunity to seek an amended order from the state divorce court
or to challenge the Board's determination in Federal court under 5 U.S.C. 8477.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(b) states that payment must be made directly to the individual(s) specified in the court order. However,
as required by the Internal Revenue Code, this paragraph also provides for a spouse or former spouse to elect to have
all or a part of the payment transferred directly to an IRA or other eligible retirement plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(c) provides that no payment may be made from an account that exceeds the vested account balance at the
time of payment, excluding any outstanding loan at the time of payment. Although outstanding loan balances are included
for purposes of computing the amount of an award as of the appropriate computation date as determined in accordance
with &sect;1653.4, payment cannot include any amount that is outstanding as a loan, because the money is not in the
account and thus is not available to be paid. Payment of more than the vested account balance excluding the outstanding
loan balance would require a payment from the Plan that would have to be absorbed by the rest of the TSP participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1653.5(d) provides that orders requiring a series of payments will not be deemed qualifying orders. If an
order requires a payment greater than the account balance as of the date of the payment, the full amount of the account
will be paid pursuant to the order. If the account subsequently receives additional money, that money will not be paid
pursuant to the court order. A new court order would be required for payment of the additional sums. In essence, a payment
pursuant to a court order extinguishes all entitlements under that court order; further payment can only be made pursuant
to a subsequent order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(e) provides that joint payments are not permitted. If more than one person is awarded a portion of the
account, the amount awarded to each must be specified in the order. Although the checks will be made payable only to
the payee(s) named in the order, the Board will permit each payee to specify the address to which the check should be
sent, even if that address is different from an address listed in the court order. However, only the payee may designate
an address to which the check should be sent, and such designation must be done in writing. The Board will not honor a
change of address submitted, for example, by the payee's attorney. A strict rule against accepting address changes
from anyone other than the payee is necessary to protect against forbidden alienations of the benefits to which the
payee, as a beneficiary of the TSP, has become entitled. Unless the address is changed by the payee, the check will be
sent to an address provided in the court order. If an order provides an address that is ``in care of'' another individual,
the check will be issued to the payee but sent to the ``in care of'' address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(f) provides that prior to payment the TSP recordkeeper must have the payee's full name, mailing address,
and Social Security number. This information may be provided in the court order or separately by the parties or their
representatives. However, as discussed in connection with paragraph (e), only the payee may change the mailing address
for the check to an address other than his or her own address. The payee's representative may not do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(g) provides that payment will be made to the payee's estate if the payee dies before payment is made
pursuant to a court order. It is not necessary that the court order be submitted to the Board prior to the death of the
payee, as long as the order was issued prior to the payee's death and in all other respects constitutes a qualifying
order. The court may, in the order, provide for an individual or entity other than the payee's estate to receive payment
in the event of the payee's death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the participant dies prior to payment of the account, a court order entered prior to the participant's death will
be honored. It does not matter that the order may not have been received by the Board prior to the participant's death.
However, if the order is not received by the Board prior to otherwise proper payment of the account to someone other
than the payee(s) specified in the court order, then the court order will not be honored. The Board will neither seek
nor accept a return of funds properly paid prior to receipt of a court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(h) provides that remarriage or termination of a legal separation does not nullify a court order that
has already been submitted to the Board. The Board does not believe it can be presumed that in all cases in which a domestic
relations court divides property, including a TSP account, the division should be rendered void merely because the
parties choose to remarry. If that is the court's intent, then the parties must obtain an order to that effect and submit
it to the Board before payment is made pursuant to the original court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(i) reflects the last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 8467(a), which provides that, ``Any payment under this subsection
to a person bars recovery by any other person.'' Once payment pursuant to a court order has been properly made, the Board
will not accept return of the money disbursed. Nor will an additional payment be made to another payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1653.5(j) provides that payments will be made from the TSP investment funds on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis. For example, if a participant's $10,000 account balance is invested 50% ($5,000) in the G Fund, 30% ($3,000)
in the C Fund and 20% ($2,000) in the F Fund, then an award of $1,000 would be paid $500 from the G Fund, $300 from the C Fund,
and $200 from the F Fund. The Board will not honor any provision in a court order that requires the payment to be made other
than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart contains regulations prescribing the Board's procedures for processing retirement benefits court
orders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;1653.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The TSP will only honor the terms of a retirement benefits court order that is qualifying under paragraph (b) of
this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A retirement benefits court order must meet each of the following requirements to be considered qualifying:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The court order must be a court decree of divorce, of annulment, or of legal separation, or any court order or court-approved
property settlement agreement incident to a decree of divorce, of annulment, or of legal separation. Orders may be
issued at any stage of a divorce, annulment, or legal separation proceeding. Orders issued prior to a final decree,
such as orders for the purpose of preserving the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pending the final resolution of the proceeding, are referred to as ``preliminary'' court orders, and will be considered
``incident to'' a final decree, notwithstanding that a final decree has not yet been, and may not be, issued. Orders
issued subsequent to a final decree, such as orders for the purpose of amending such decree, are referred to as ``subsequent''
court orders, and will also be considered ``incident to'' such decree. However, any subsequent order that requires
the return of money properly paid pursuant to an earlier court order will not constitute a qualifying order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The court order must ``expressly relate'' to the Thrift Savings Plan account of a current TSP participant. This
means that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The order must on its face specifically describe the TSP in such a way that it cannot be confused with other Federal
Government retirement benefits or non-Federal retirement benefits; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The order must be written in terms appropriate to a defined contribution plan rather than a defined benefit plan.
For example, it should generally refer to the individual participant's ``account'' or ``account balance'' rather
than a ``benefit formula'' or the participant's ``eventual benefits.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the court order awards an amount to be paid from the participant's TSP account, the award must be for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A specific dollar amount;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A stated percentage or stated fraction of the account;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A portion of the account to be calculated by applying a formula that yields a mathematically possible result.
Any variables in the formula must have values that are readily ascertainable from the face of the order or from Government
employment records; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A survivor annuity as provided in 5 U.S.C. 8435(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Court orders that make awards from the TSP may only provide for payments to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Spouses or former spouses of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Attorneys for spouses or former spouses of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Dependent children or other dependents of the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Attorneys for dependent children or other dependents of the participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The following retirement benefits court orders will be considered non-qualifying:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Orders relating to a TSP account that contains only nonvested money, unless the money will become vested within
90 days of the date of receipt of the order if the participant remains in Federal service;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Orders that award an amount to be paid at a future specified date or upon the occurrence of a future specified
event, unless:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The amount of the entitlement can be currently calculated; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The award provides for the payment of interest or earnings from the date of calculation to the specified date or
event for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If an order meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section, a current payment will
be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in &sect;1653.5, rather than a payment at the future date stated
in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, orders that require only that the amount of the award be calculated
on the date of payment, without stating a future date or event for payment, will not be considered as awarding an amount
to be paid at a future date or upon the occurrence of a future event. In such cases, the date of payment will be determined
in accordance with the procedures set forth in &sect;1653.5, and the amount of the entitlement will be determined
in accordance with &sect;1653.4 using that date of payment.

&sect;1653.3 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Processing retirement benefits court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Board's review of retirement benefits court orders is governed solely by the Federal Employees' Retirement
System Act (FERSA), 5 U.S.C. Chapter 84, and by the terms of this part. The Board will honor retirement benefits court
orders properly issued by a court of any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and any Indian court. However, those courts have no jurisdiction
over the Board and the Board cannot be made a party to the underlying domestic relations proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Retirement benefits court orders should be submitted to the Board's recordkeeper at the following address: Thrift
Savings Plan Service Office, National Finance Center, P.O. Box 61500, New Orleans, Louisiana 70161&hyph;1500.
Receipt by the recordkeeper will be considered receipt by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Upon receipt of a document that purports to be a qualifying retirement benefits court order, including preliminary
and subsequent court orders, the participant's account will be frozen. After an account is frozen, no withdrawals
or loans will be allowed until the account is unfrozen. All other account activity, including contributions, adjustments,
and interfund transfers, will be permitted. The parties will be notified that the participant's account has been
frozen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The following documents will not be treated as purporting to be qualifying retirement benefits court orders.
Therefore accounts of participants to whom such orders relate will not be frozen and these documents will not be reviewed
by the Board:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A document that does not indicate on its face (or accompany a document that establishes) that it has been issued
or approved by a court;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A court order relating to a TSP account that has been closed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A court order dated prior to June 6, 1986;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A court order that fails to award all or any part of the TSP account to anyone other than the participant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A court order that does not mention retirement benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) After the participant's account is frozen, the document will be reviewed initially to determine if it is a complete
original or copy of a retirement benefits court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) It it is determined that the document is not complete, a complete document will be requested. If it is not received
within 30 days of the date of such request, the account will be unfrozen and no further action will be taken with respect
to the document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Upon receipt of a complete order that is either an original or a copy of a retirement benefits court order, the Board
will review the order and will determine whether it is a qualifying order as described in &sect;1653.2 and, if it awards
an amount to be paid from a participant's TSP account, the amount of the entitlement. The Board will advise all parties
in writing of its decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Board's decision will contain the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Board's determination regarding whether the court order is qualifying;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A statement of the applicable statute or regulations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the order is determined to be qualifying, a statement regarding the effect that compliance with the court order
will have on the participant's TSP account;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the order requires payment, a description of the method by which the entitlement under the court order was calculated
and the circumstances under which payment will be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Board's decision will be final. There is no administrative appeal from the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) An account frozen under this section will be unfrozen as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a complete document has not been received within 30 days from the date of a request described in paragraph (f)
of this section, upon expiration of the 30-day period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If the order is a preliminary order or other order precluding payment from the account, as soon as practicable after
receipt of a certified copy or original court order vacating or superseding such order (unless the order vacating
or superseding the preliminary order itself warrants placing a freeze on the account).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the order is valid to award a payment from the TSP account of a participant under this part, upon payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Board determines that the order is not a qualifying order under this part, 45 days after issuance of the Board's
decision. The 45-day period will be terminated if both parties submit a written request for such a termination to the
Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Multiple court orders pending before the Board will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this part in the following order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As between conflicting qualifying court orders relating to the same spouse or former spouse, the Board will process
only the court order bearing the latest date entered by the clerk of the court. If any order does not have a date entered,
then the date the order was filed by the clerk shall be used; if there is no date entered or date filed, then the date the
order was signed by the judge shall be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As between conflicting qualifying court orders relating to two or more former spouses, the Board will process
the orders in the order of the dates entered by the clerk of the court, starting with the order bearing the earliest date,
and continuing until the account is exhausted. If any order does not have a date entered, then the date the order was
filed by the clerk shall be used; if there is no date entered or date filed, then the date the order was signed by the judge
shall be used.

Calculating entitlement under a retirement benefits court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of the account as of a specific date or event, the amount of the
entitlement will be calculated based upon the balance of the account as of the end of the month on or immediately preceding
the date or event, plus any transactions posted after the date or event, but before payment, that are effective on or
before the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement. For purposes of computing the amount of an entitlement,
any loan amount outstanding as of the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement shall be treated as included
in the account balance, unless the court order provides otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the court order awards a percentage or fraction of an account but does not contain a specific date as of which to
apply the percentage or fraction to the account, the amount of the entitlement will be calculated as described in paragraph
(a) of this section, using the account balance as of the end of the month on or immediately prior to the date the order
was entered by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not show a date entered, the date the order was filed by the clerk
of the court or, if the order does not contain a date entered or a date filed, the date signed by the judge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the court order awards a specific dollar amount, the amount of the entitlement will be the lesser of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The amount of order awards; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount in the account as of the end of the month on or before the date specified in the order (or, if no date is specified,
the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or, if the order does not show a date entered, the date the order
was filed by the clerk of the court, or, if the order does not contain a date entered or a date filed, the date signed by
the judge) plus any transactions posted after the date or event, but before payment, that are effective on or before
the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement. For purposes of computing the amount of entitlement, any
loan amount outstanding as of the month-end date used for calculating the entitlement shall be treated as included
in the account balance, unless the court order provides otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Unless the court order specifically provides otherwise, the entitlement calculated under this section will
not be credited with interest or earnings. If interest or earnings are awarded, the Board will use the monthly rates
of return credited to the account unless the court order specifies a different rate. The TSP monthly rates of return
may be either positive or negative. Interest or earnings will be calculated beginning with the month following the
month-end valuation date used for calculating the entitlement and ending with the month prior to the month of payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All entitlements will be calculated initially under this section including both vested and nonvested amounts
in the participant's account. If at the time of payment the non-vested portion of the account has not become vested
or has been forfeited, the entitlement will be recalculated using only the participant's vested account balance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If a qualifying court order creates an entitlement to a portion of a TSP account under this part, payment will be
made no sooner than 30 days after the Board's decision has been issued and the appropriate tax withholding notification
has been provided.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) A payment made pursuant to a qualifying court order will be made only to the person(s) specified in the court order.
If payment is to be made to the spouse or former spouse of the participant, he or she may request that the TSP transfer
all or a portion of his or her payment to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or other eligible retirement plan.
Such a request must be made by filing a Spouse Election to Transfer to IRA or Other Eligible Retirement Plan, and must
be received prior to payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In no case may a payment made pursuant to a qualifying court order exceed the participant's vested account balance,
excluding any outstanding loan amount as of the end of the month preceding the date of payment. If the entitlement calculated
pursuant to this subpart exceeds the participant's vested account balance (excluding any outstanding loan amount),
then only the vested amount in the account (excluding the outstanding loan balance) will be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The entire amount of an entitlement created by a qualifying court order must be disbursed at one time. A series of
payments will not be made even if the court order provides for such a method of payment. A payment pursuant to a court
order extinguishes all further rights to any payment under that order even if the entire amount of the entitlement
could not be paid. Any further award must be contained in a separate court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment cannot be made jointly to more than one person. If payment is to be made more than one individual, the order
must separately indicate the amount to be paid to each.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In order to make a payment pursuant to a retirement benefits court order, the Board's recordkeeper must be provided
with the full name, mailing address, and Social Security number of the payee, even if the payment is being mailed to
another address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If the payee dies before a payment is made pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order, payment will
be made to the estate of the payee, unless otherwise specified by the court order. If the participant dies before payment
is made pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits order entered prior to the participant's death, the order will
be honored as long as it is submitted to the Board before payment of the account, regardless of whether the order was
received by the Board prior to the participant's death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) If the parties to a divorce or annulment are remarried, or a legal separation is terminated, a new court order will
be required to prevent payment pursuant to a previously submitted qualifying retirement benefits court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Payment to a person (including the estate of the payee) pursuant to a qualifying retirement benefits court order,
made in accordance with this subpart, bars recovery by any other person pursuant to that order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Payments pursuant to qualifying court orders will be paid 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the TSP investment funds, based on the balance in each fund on the date as of which the payment is made. The Board
will not honor provisions of court orders that require payment to be made from specific investment funds.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) proposes to amend its regulations in response to a
petition for rulemaking. The rulemaking would require that the regulatory authority provide to each person who was
a party to an informal conference its written findings granting, requiring modification of, or denying a permit application.
The rulemaking would also require both that an approved permit contain in its permit area only lands for which the applicant
has established a right-to-enter and commence surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and that compliance
with an approved permit be based on activities to be conducted solely upon such lands.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated September 29, 1992, Mr. Jim B. Wyant of Vincennes, Indiana, presented a petition for rulemaking to
OSM. A ``Notice of availability of a petition to initiate rulemaking and request for comment'' was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, November 12, 1992, (57 FR 53670). After consideration of the petitioner's requests and public comments received
on the petition, the Director of OSM published his ``Notice of decision on petition for rulemaking'' and stated that
``OSM will initiate Federal rulemaking proposing to revise the permit application provisions of 30 CFR 773.15 to
require notification of all parties to an informal conference of any decision to require modification of the permit
application. OSM will also initiate a rulemaking to revise the provisions of 30 CFR 778.15 to address the degree to
which lands may be included in the permit area where the permittee does not have the right-to-enter.'' (August 24,
1993, 58 FR 44630)

Notification Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM proposes to modify 30 CFR 773.15, Review of Permit Applications at 773.15(a)(1). The sentences of this subparagraph
would be redesignated as (1), (i) and (ii) with an additional sentence added as subsection (iii). The added sentence
would require that the regulatory authority ``(p)rovide a copy of the written decision granting, requiring modification
of, or denying the permit, and stating the specific reasons for the decision to the permit applicant and to each person
who was a party to the conference.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM is proposing to revise &sect;773.15(a) because its current regulations 30 CFR 773.19(b)(1) only require the
regulatory authority to provide written notification of its final decision on the permit application to all parties
to an informal conference. Its regulations at &sect;773.15(a) do not, however, require the regulatory authority
to provide the same notification to the same parties when that authority requires a modification of the permit application.
Section 773.15(a) would, therefore, be revised to require the regulatory authority to provide parties to an informal
conference the same notification of decisions modifying the permit application as for decisions approving or denying
the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1979 final permanent regulations at 30 CFR 786.23(c) originally required the regulatory authority to notify
all parties to an informal conference of any decision granting, modifying or denying the permit application, and
stating the specific reasons therefor in the decision. (March 13, 44 FR 15381) This required notice provision was
dropped without explanation in the 1983 revision of OSM's permitting regulations. (September 28, 48 FR 44371, 44395)
Thus, under the current 30 part 773 regulations, and as noted by the petitioner, concerned parties who have taken an
active role in the permitting process through participation in informal conferences may find that regulatory authority
decisions requiring modification of the permit application are conveyed solely to the applicant. These concerned
parties would receive no feedback on important permit application issues until the regulatory authority's final
decision on the application is conveyed to all parties pursuant to &sect;773.19(b)(1). The proposed revisions to
&sect;773.15(a) would address this inequity by reinstating the 1979 requirement that all parties to an informal
conference be provided the regulatory authority's written decision granting, modifying, or denying the permit
application and stating the specific reasons therefore in the decision.

 August 24, 1993, the agency stated that it would ``initiate a rulemaking to revise the provisions of 30 CFR 778.15 to
address the degree to which lands may be included in the permit area where the permittee does not have the right-to-enter.''
Later, in considering this commitment, OSM concluded that it could be more appropriately implemented by proposing
revisions to &sect;773.15, Review of permit applications, and 30 CFR 773.17, Permit conditions, rather than to &sect;778.15,
Right-of-entry information. Existing section 773.15 would therefore be revised to add paragraph (c)(13) requiring
both that the approved permit contain only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct
surface mining and reclamation operations and that compliance with the operation and reclamation plans be based
upon activities conducted solely upon such lands.

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A new but different subparagraph &sect;773.15(c)(13) has also been proposed under the remining rulemaking. (June
2, 1994, 59 FR 28744) If both this and the remining rulemaking are finalized as proposed, the (c)(13) subparagraph
of the second effective rule will be redesignated as (c)(14).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing &sect;773.17 would also be revised to be consistent with proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) and would, as a permit
condition, impose a similar requirement that the permit area of an approved permit contain only lands for which the
applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(b)(9) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, states, ``the applicant shall file with the regulatory authority on an accurate map or plan, to an appropriate scale,
clearly showing the land to be affected as of the date of the application, the area of land within the permit area upon
which the applicant has the legal right-to-enter and commence surface mining operations on that area affected, and
whether that right is the subject of pending court litigation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That nothing in this Act shall be construed as vesting in the regulatory authority the jurisdiction to adjudicate
property title disputes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations are silent on the specific question of whether the approved permit can include
land for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry (``uncontrolled land'') and which will not be disturbed
under the permit until such right-of-entry is obtained. It has, however, been OSM's practice under its Federal and
Indian lands programs to allow inclusion in the permit application of land for which the applicant can not establish
right-of-entry but to prohibit inclusion of such land in the permit at the time of issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Promulgation of this Federal practice as a national rule would end the practice in a minority of approved program States
of allowing inclusion in the approved permit of land for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry. The owners
of such lands often complain that this inclusion clouds their title, depresses their property values, and interferes
with their ability to enjoy their property rights.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) ``(t)he applicant has demonstrated that the approved permit area
contains only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface coal mining and
reclamation operations'' and similar language in proposed &sect;773.17(a) are intended to prohibit the inclusion
of uncontrolled land in the permit area of approved permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's oversight of those State programs allowing uncontrolled land in the permit area of approved permits has shown
that the validity of the operation and reclamation plans required by 30 CFR part 780 may be substantially compromised
by the applicant's subsequent inability to gain access to blocks of land within the permit area upon which the plans
were predicated. Examples exist where central elements upon which approval was based required modification when
the applicant subsequently was unable to obtain access to required land. In various instances, proposed spoil and
soil storage areas, borrow areas, and facility areas have been unavailable for use. Sediment control strategies
have been compromised when land for sediment ponds and diversion ditches in the approved operation and reclamation
plans was unavailable. Changes have occurred which require recalculation of the bond amount. While OSM recognizes
the need for operation and reclamation plans to be dynamic enough to accommodate new information and unexpected conditions
that may develop, changes such as those described militate against the credibility of OSM's regulatory scheme which
is to be based upon the approval or rejection of accurate and reliable operation and reclamation plans. Accordingly,
and in partial response to industry's comments discussed below, OSM is also proposing that &sect;773.15(c)(13)
include the requirement that compliance with the operation and reclamation plans be based upon activities to be conducted
solely upon lands for which the applicant has the right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations.
This language is intended to put all parties on notice that operation and reclamation plans included in the approved
permit cannot be based on activities to be conducted on uncontrolled land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters opposing the petition argued that the inclusion of uncontrolled land in the permit areas of permit
applications and approved permits is necessary to accommodate the complexities of real estate transaction involved
in mine plan development and to allow for environmental planning based on a more conceptually complete mining and
reclamation plan. While OSM acknowledges that inclusion of uncontrolled lands in an approved permit may allow the
formulation of a comprehensive and cumulative operation and reclamation plan and environmental analysis, such
plans and analysis may not prove reliable and, therefore, may not provide the regulatory authority with a reasonable
basis for concluding that the lands for which the applicant has right-of-entry can actually be mined and reclaimed
in accordance with the Act and in compliance with its implementing regulations. 30 CFR 773.15(c) (1), (2) and 780.2.
Neither would the commenter's suggestion that the approved permit be conditioned to authorize mining only on lands
for which right-of-entry is obtained address this potential defect in the permitted operation and reclamation plans
and associated environmental analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;773.15(c)(13) and 773.17(a) would not preclude inclusion under &sect;778.15(a) of a reasonable
amount of uncontrolled land in the permit application thus accommodating the need for continued real estate transactions
during the permit review process and facilitating the development of environmental projections based on mining
and reclamation on a scale the applicant plans to achieve. However, under the proposed rule permit issuance would
be predicated upon the existence of a clearly discernible and finite permit area in the operation and reclamation
plans where the applicant's ability to obtain right-of-entry is not a variable that would influence the execution
of the plans as approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In practical terms, the requirement of proposed &sect;773.15(c)(13) that ``compliance with the operation and reclamation
plans is based upon activities to be conducted solely upon such lands'' means that immediately prior to permit issuance
the regulatory authority must reassess the legitimacy of the applicant's operation and reclamation plans taking
into account the impact of the applicant's lack of access to any uncontrolled land. Loss of a piece of land necessary
for the accomplishment of the operation or reclamation plan could require permit modification or permit denial.
It is anticipated that the &sect;773.15(c)(13) requirement will militate against inclusion in the permit application
of properties for which the applicant is unlikely to obtain right-of-entry by the time of permit issuance. This should
in turn accrue to the benefit of landowners who never wanted their properties included in the permit application.
It should also accrue to the benefit of the environment as planning would be based on more plausible real estate projections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;&sect;773.15(c)(13) and 773.17(a) are seen as striking a reasonable balance between not unnecessarily
burdening the legitimate mining industry and protecting the rights of landowners while providing the regulatory
authority with the accurate, comprehensive and reliable information it needs to comply with its responsibilities
under 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1), (2) and 780.2. These proposals are not intended to alter existing standards for establishing
right-of-entry. They merely require that the applicant must demonstrate that the permit area of the approved permit
contains only lands for which he has established a right-of-entry.

, that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Although
OSM does not have data on the number of coal mine operations or the number of landowners and amount of land that would
be affected by this rule, data obtained from OSM Field Offices on 14 States indicates that only 3 of those States do not
notify participants as to the outcome of informal conferences, and that only 6 out of 18 States for which data is available
allow land in the permit area of an approved permit for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry authorization.
However, to notify the participants to a conference of the outcome of that conference is a procedural type of action
entailing minor economic consequences comprised of the cost of mailing notices to the participants, and to require
that an applicant have right-of-entry authorization to all lands included in the permit area of an approved permit
does not take any economic rights from the applicant, nor does it impose significant additional costs on the applicant.
Therefore, the proposed revisions are not expected to be of economic significance.

OSM has prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA), and has made a tentative finding that the proposed rule would
not significantly affect the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). The EA is on file in the OSM Administrative Record at the address specified
previously (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). An EA will be completed on the final rule and a finding made on the significance of any resulting impacts prior to promulgation
of the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778,
Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered
by the preamble discussion of this proposed rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the
Executive Order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy,
States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth
in OSM's rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule
would be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent
that the proposed rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent
State laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. What is the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed or modified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation
of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions
that are affected by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Does the rule provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while
promoting simplification and burden reduction? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics
covered and the mandates of SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. What is the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Are administrative proceedings required before parties may file suit in court? Which proceedings apply? Is the
exhaustion of administrative remedies required?

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging the provisions of this
rule under section 526(a) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1276(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the rule, however, administrative procedures must be exhausted.
In situations involving OSM application of the rule, applicable administrative procedures may be found at 43 CFR
part 4. In situations involving State regulatory authority application of provisions equivalent to those contained
in this rule, applicable administrative procedures are set forth in the particular State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Does the rule define key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes that explicitly
define those items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Terms which are important to the understanding of this rule are set forth in 30 CFR 700.5 and 701.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Does the rule address other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations set forth
by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, that are determined
to be in accordance with the purposes of the Executive Order?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget have not issued any guidance on this requirement.

The Federal Government's plant variety protection rights to this variety are assigned to the United States of America,
as represented by the Secretary of Agriculture. It is in the public interest to so license this invention, for UGRF
has submitted a complete and sufficient application for a license. The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing
and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 USC 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be
granted unless, within ninety days from the date of this published Notice, the Agricultural Research Service receives
written evidence and argument which establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements
of 35 USC 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared two environmental assessments
and findings of no significant impact for the shipment of unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing.
Risk analyses, which form the bases for the environmental assessments, have led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of
the human environment. Based on our findings of no significant impact, we have determined that environmental impact
statements need not be prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151

et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.
A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In
order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization
from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological products
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted risk analyses to assess the products' potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on those risk analyses, APHIS has prepared environmental assessments.
APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not significantly
affect the quality of the human environment. Based on these findings of no significant impact, we have determined
that there is no need to prepare environmental impact statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These evaluations will be conducted pursuant to section 312 and section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972
(CZMA), as amended. The CZMA requires a continuing review of the performance of Coastal Management Programs (CMPs)
and National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRs). Evaluation of CMPs requires findings concerning the extent to
which a State has met the national coastal management objectives, adhered to its Coastal Management Program approved
by the Secretary of Commerce, and adhered to the terms of financial assistance awards funded under the CZMA. Evaluation
of NERRs requires findings concerning the operation and management of the reserve including education and interpretive
activities, the consistency of research activities with the approved research guidelines, and the existence of
a basis for the continued support of the findings for designation. The evaluations will include a site visit, consideration
of public comments, and consultations with interested Federal, State, and local agencies and members of the public.
Public meetings are held as part of the site visits.

Notice is hereby given that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has applied in due form for a modification
to Permit 818 (P211C) requesting an increase in the take of listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR
parts 217-227).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ODFW requests authorization for an increase in the take of juvenile, endangered, Snake River spring/summer chinook
salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) because of their plans to expand their research sampling at Catherine Creek as
a part of their life history, smolt migration, and habitat studies in the upper Grande Ronde and Imnaha River basins.
In addition, an unexpectedly high production of juveniles in 1994, partially attributed to recent progeny production
from listed Rapid River Hatchery adults passed above the hatchery to spawn, is resulting in greater capture numbers
and associated indirect mortality. The juvenile salmon's larger than expected escapement in the spring of 1995 will
allow ODFW to increase the sample size for their scientific research. A larger number of juveniles would be captured,
handled, and receive passive integrated transponder tags for the modification and the increased take would be authorized
for 1994 and 1995 only.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 14, 1994, the Air Force signed a Supplemental Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton
AFB. The decisions included in this Supplemental ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information
contained in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on
June 4, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Norton AFB closed on March 31, 1994, pursaunt to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment
Act (BCRA) (Public Law No. 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment
and Closure. This Supplemental ROD modifies certain previous decisions made in the Partial ROD executed on December
15, 1993, first supplemental January 14, 1994, and subsequently supplemental March 30, 1994. The previous decisions
making Parcels C, F, H, H&hyph;1, I&hyph;1, I&hyph;2, I&hyph;3, K&hyph;1, K&hyph;2, K&hyph;4, and the Easements
and Utilities, available for disposal by neogtiated or public sale is modified to provide for the disposal of such
property by Economic Development Conveyance under the provisions of Public Law No. 103&hyph;160, the Pryor Amendments.
In all other respects, previous decisions regarding such parcels are unchanged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal
adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local regulations and
statutes, and all practicable and reasonable efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public
and environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E.B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696&hyph;5534.
Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project (Newberry Project), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide billing credits
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EWEB), and to provide wheeling services to EWEB for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission of this power to their system. BPA has decided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquire 20 average megawatts (aMW) of electrical power from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
privately-owned geothermal power plant on the west flank of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newberry Volcano in Deschutes County, Oregon. The Newberry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project will generate 30 aMW and will be developed, owned, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated by CE Newberry, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA has decided to grant billing credits to EWEB for 10 aMW of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical power and to provide wheeling services to EWEB for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission of this power to their system. BPA expects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newberry Project to be in commercial operation by November 1997.

Purpose and Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a self-financing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal power marketing agency with statutory responsibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply electricity to utility, industrial, and other customers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Northwest Electric Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) requires BPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet its customers' electric power requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 U.S.C. 839d(a)(2). As part of its mission, BPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for acquiring conservation and additional generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources sufficient to meet the future needs of its utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers. Section 6(d) of the Northwest Power Act authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA to acquire experimental, developmental, demonstration, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot projects of a type with potential for providing cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective service to the region. 16 U.S.C. 839d(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council (Council), in its 1986 Power Plan, noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;approximately 4,400 megawatts of cost-effective electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy could be obtained through the development of regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geothermal resource areas.'' However, because the resource had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been confirmed, it was not included in the portfolio of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986 Plan. The Power Plan called for methods of confirming this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource so that it would be available when needed. Newberry

Volcano, Oregon, was identified as one of the most promising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Newberry Project was selected under the BPA Geothermal Pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project Program. The goal of the Program is to initiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of the Pacific Northwest's large, but essentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
untapped, geothermal resources, and to confirm the availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this resource to meet the energy needs of the region. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary underlying objective of this Program is to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply of alternative sources of electrical power to help meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing regional power demands and needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA's purposes for this action are to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Meet contractual obligations to supply requested, cost-effective power to BPA customers, having considered
potential environmental impacts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigation measures in its decision; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assure consistency with BPA's statutory responsibilities, including the Pacific Northwest Electric Power
Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act), while taking into consideration the Pacific Northwest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council's (Council) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation and Electric Power Plan (Power Plan) and Fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Test the availability of geothermal energy to provide a reliable, economical, and environmentally acceptable
alternative energy source to help meet the region's power needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To make these decisions, BPA cooperated on and adopted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Final Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement (FEIS) (DOE/EIS_0207, June 1994). The FEIS was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tiered to the Resource Programs Environmental Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(RPEIS&hyph;DOE/EIS&hyph;0162), which considered the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tradeoffs among the resource types available to meet BPA's needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS evaluated the exploration, development, utilization, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning phases of the Newberry Project as well as related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission, wheeling, and billing credit components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative A is the CEC/EWEB proposal, and Alternative B is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three Federal agencies' modification of the proposal. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to identifying and analyzing the environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these two alternatives for the Newberry Project, the FEIS also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated the No Action alternative. By contract, the Newberry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project is required to meet all Federal, state, and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The FEIS fulfills the requirements of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and meets the needs of the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forest Service (USFS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have documented their decisions in a separate, joint ROD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA has also determined that this action is consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council's 1991 Power Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information analyzed and disclosed in the FEIS and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated documents, including the USFS/BLM ROD, BPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the preferred alternative is Alternative B with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions and mitigation and monitoring elements described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the USFS/BLM ROD. A Mitigation Action Plan (MAP) developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the FEIS analysis is available. It requires implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the specific mitigation requirements described in the FEIS and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USFS/BLM ROD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
BPA develops and publishes a biennial integrated least cost plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Resource Program. In its Draft 1990 Resource Program, BPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said it would be willing to participate in up to three geothermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot projects. The purpose of these projects would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiate development, confirm resources, and determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to develop three of the largest, most promising sites in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the region. BPA agreed to purchase_in joint ventures with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional utilities_up to 10 average megawatts (aMW) from each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of three projects. After receiving comments from customers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting the projects, and after the Council approved this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach in its 1991 Power Plan, BPA published a solicitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that resulted in seven proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of BPA's solicitation were to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Meet contractual obligations to supply requested, cost-effective power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to BPA customers, having considered potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures in its decision; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assure consistency with BPA's statutory responsibilities, including the Northwest Power Act, while taking
into consideration the Council's Power Plan and Fish and Wildlife Program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Test the availability of geothermal energy to provide a reliable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economical, and environmentally acceptable alternative energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source to help meet the region's power needs. Three projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were selected for contract negotiations on December 17, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the selected projects was a proposal by the California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Company (CEC) and the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop a 30-aMW geothermal power plant and supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities at Newberry Volcano, Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Administrative Record of Decision sets out the reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA's decision to execute a Power Purchase Agreement with CE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newberry, Inc. (a subsidiary of CEC), through which BPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase electrical output from the proposed Newberry Project; to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
execute a Billing Credits Generation Agreement with EWEB for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the output from the Newberry Project; and to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wheeling services to EWEB for the transmission of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity to their system.

BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Department of Energy. BPA was established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market wholesale power from the Bonneville Dam and to construct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power lines for the transmission of this power to load centers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Northwest. As other Federal dams and transmission lines were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built, the combined power and transmission facilities have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated into a single power supply system. Today, BPA markets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power from 30 Federal hydroelectric projects and two nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. BPA's transmission systems contain 14,797 circuit miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and provide about half of the region's power and three-fourths of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its transmission capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA sells wholesale electric power to 126 utilities, 13 direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service industrial customers (DSIs), and several government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. BPA's primary marketing area is the Pacific Northwest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region, comprised of the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of Montana lying west of the continental divide, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small portions of California, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 U.S.C. 837 and 839a(14). BPA also has congressional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization to sell or exchange wholesale power outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific Northwest to the extent that such power is surplus to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the needs of the region. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16 U.S.C. 837a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Northwest Power Act directs BPA to serve the net power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of any Pacific Northwest electric utility requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest Power Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric power resources. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16 U.S.C. 839a(1) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 U.S.C. 839d. BPA may acquire a major resource (a resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having a planned capability greater than 50 aMW and acquired for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 5 years, 16 U.S.C. 839a(12)) if it is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Council's Power Plan. 16 U.S.C. 839d(c)(1)(D). If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource is not major, the Northwest Power Act instructs that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource must be consistent with the priorities required of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan. 16 U.S.C. 839d(b)(1) and (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Northwest Power Act authorizes BPA to acquire experimental, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental, demonstration, or pilot projects of a type with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for providing cost-effective service to the region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 U.S.C. 839d(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA is also directed by the Northwest Power Act to grant billing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits to a customer, if requested. 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billing credit agreement is a contract between BPA and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customer, under which BPA gives the customer a credit on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power bill for the difference between BPA's wholesale power rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the cost of power from a new resource. The energy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity on which the credit is based is the net amount the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource reduces the customer's load on BPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, BPA must satisfy all requirements of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

BPA load forecasts for the 1990 Resource Program showed that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the medium load growth rate occurs, BPA must acquire 500 aMW by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the year 2000 to meet customers' needs. Pacific Northwest Loads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Resources Study, 1990. If utility and DSI loads grow at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medium-high rate, BPA will need to acquire an additional 1,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aMW by the year 2000. The analysis in BPA's Resource Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement (RPEIS) showed that geothermal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a reliable source of electric power that can help meet energy

BPA's 1990 Resource Program, issued July 1990, defined the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions BPA would take to develop new resources to meet the power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of its customers. The 1990 Resource Program focused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, and included near-term actions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare for these years. One of these actions was an offer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in geothermal pilot projects aimed at confirming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources and determining developability at three of the largest, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most promising sites in the Pacific Northwest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Resource Program was developed through an extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public process that included a technical review panel. Many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments received supported BPA's participation in geothermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot projects.

The Council's 1991 Power Plan noted that the geothermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmation program in BPA's 1990 Resource Program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the recommendations of the Council's Research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development, and Demonstration Advisory Committee. The Council's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Recommended Activities for Implementing the 1991 Power Plan'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included geothermal demonstration projects initiated by BPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the region's utilities. The Council acknowledged that energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of a demonstration plant would likely be higher than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marginal cost of other new resources, but the premium would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline over time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BPA published a Request for Proposals (RFP) in Commerce Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily on July 5, 1991. The RFP stated that BPA would be willing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to purchase up to 10 aMW of electric power from each of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects located in or near the BPA service area. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions specified in the RFP were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;BPA would not finance projects but only purchase output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Part of the output from each project had to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased by another utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Overall project size could be greater than 10 aMW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The proposed site had to be capable of supporting at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 100 MW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The proposed site had to be suitable for operation as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal geothermal unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The resource area had to be undeveloped for electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The power contract had to include an option for BPA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase subsequent output from the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Projects that would allow BPA to be a cooperating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency in a BLM environmental process were strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions were intended in part to limit the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals likely to be submitted. BPA could devote only a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of staff time to evaluating proposals, and therefore tried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be quite specific about what it wanted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project sponsors were encouraged to submit project outlines or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summaries ahead of time before developing detailed proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This was intended to prevent developers from spending money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing proposals that would not meet program goals. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developers met with program staff or discussed the RFP on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal basis before submitting proposals. Letters of intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were due September 3, 1991, and proposals were due October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991.

Further information on BPA's Geothermal Pilot Project Program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published prior to the solicitation in an article in a geothermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry trade journal, the Geothermal Resources Council BULLETIN 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(December 1990). The article specified that the projects had to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be in three different resource areas, preferably involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different resource developers. This article was provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developers and others who inquired about the RFP or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Geothermal Pilot Project Program.

Proposals Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seven proposals were received. Two of them clearly did not meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program objectives, and a third was withdrawn by the sponsor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the evaluation period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the projects not meeting program objectives was located in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada. Although projects located outside the United States were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not excluded in the RFP, a foreign project would not have met the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program goal of testing ability to overcome (U.S.) institutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barriers to development. Furthermore, a Canadian project would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be subject to a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A project was proposed at Raft River, Idaho, employing a power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle (the ``Kalina'' cycle) considered to be precommercial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing new power plant technologies was not a goal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, and previously developed sites were specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded by the RFP. In the early 1980s, Raft River was the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a demonstration plant developed by the U.S. Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy. Sponsors of the Canadian and Raft River projects were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified on October 30, 1991, that their proposals had been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated from consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four proposals received detailed evaluation. They were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A proposal by the California Energy Company (CEC) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB) for a 30&hyph;MW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project at Newberry Volcano, Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A proposal by Vulcan Power Company (Vulcan) for a 30&hyph;MW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project at Newberry Volcano, Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A proposal by Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corporation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 30&hyph;MW project at Vale, Oregon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A proposal by Unocal Corporation for a 14&hyph;MW project at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Two sets of criteria were used. The first set, considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``threshold'' criteria, were the criteria stated in the RFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals were eliminated from further consideration if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed to meet any of these criteria except the utility cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing requirement. Threshold criteria included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Resource area considered capable of producing at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 MW
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since BPA required the sites to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undeveloped, there was no way to know reservoir size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with much certainty for the proposed sites. If better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data were not available, a resource estimate by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Geological Survey or some other authoritative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source was considered sufficient basis for meeting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Suitable for operation as a unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conserving the resource, Federal geothermal leasing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations allow geothermal leaseholders to unite with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each other in the development or operation of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geothermal resource area. The leases affected by such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cooperative arrangement are called a unit, and one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the leaseholders is designated the unit operator. 43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 3243. BPA wanted to encourage coordinated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development and avoid resource depletion problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced elsewhere, and therefore included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitability for unitization as a selection criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lease block had to be unitized or suitable for unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation with the developer as operator. If the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not already unitized, the developer had to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a large and reasonably contiguous lease block. Bureau 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Land Management staff were consulted regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitability of proposed sites for unitization. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be noted that unitization in itself was not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of this requirement. The objective was to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage coordinated development and conservation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resource. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Resource area not previously developed for electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power production
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A program goal was to develop new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources. If a power project had already been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed at a site, the site did not meet this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Output contract proposed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amenable to BPA receiving an option on future power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the lease block
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since the cost of power from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first project was expected to exceed the cost of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources available to BPA, BPA required a right of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first refusal on up to 100 MW of additional development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at each site. Subsequent plants would benefit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established infrastructure and lower risks, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of power from them would likely be more cost-effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost sharing by another utility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Initiating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of Northwest resources would have regionwide benefit. A cooperative effort that included cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing seemed appropriate. It was recognized that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developers might have difficulty enlisting another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility before BPA identified candidate projects, so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to meet this criterion did not disqualify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal during the evaluation period. Developers were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified of this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project allows BPA to be a cooperating agency in a BLM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental process
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Staffing constraints would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow BPA to be the lead agency in the NEPA review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion effectively limited projects to Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Tribal land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second set of criteria addressed the developer
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the project successfully. These are standard criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by BPA in previous and subsequent solicitations, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Development team experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. How qualified was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project team? Had they worked together on previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful projects? A salaried staff currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in project development or in operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects tended to be rated more highly than a listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of consultants that would be hired for a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project. A salaried staff was thought to indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater stability and commitment by the developer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining a long term presence in the geothermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. There was also no guarantee that the listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultants would ever work on a proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ability to finance the project
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proven ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finance projects was desired. Was the developer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced in obtaining construction and long term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project financing? Was the financing plan realistic? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Audited financial reports were requested from each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developer, and Dun and Bradstreet financial information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports were obtained, if available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with land management agencies in the project areas, and

requested additional information from developers, when

Cost of energy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This was used more as a starting point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for negotiations than as a selection criterion. BPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not expect developers to commit to a price until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terms and conditions of the power contract were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better known. Another reason for not selecting based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on price was to avoid being forced to select weak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects with unrealistic power prices and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discourage ``low-ball'' bids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation process included a preliminary evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals, followed by requests from the BPA project team for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information and a final evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An issue of site control affecting the two proposed projects at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newberry Volcano was examined. The ownership or ownership share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of three leases_OR 11987, OR 11992, and OR 45506_was a matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dispute between CEC and Vulcan. Since both developers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered it likely that litigation would be necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve this dispute, and because BPA's decision to purchase only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output was thought to place all risk of nonperformance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developer, this was not a critical factor in the selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BPA team selected three projects for further consideration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Administrator was briefed and a final decision made on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 17, 1991. The proposers were notified of BPA's decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by registered letter between December 18 and December 20, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December 18 letter to Vulcan Power Company, which was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected, explained the reasons for BPA's decision. The CEC/EWEB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project was stronger in many respects and met BPA requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for utility cost sharing. Also, Vulcan lacked a history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful project development (the one project it attempted was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsuccessful). As noted in the December 1990 Geothermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Council BULLETIN article mentioned above, only one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project would be chosen at each site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Contract Negotiations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three projects selected for contract discussions were Glass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mountain, Vale, and the CEC/EWEB Newberry Project. All three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects were considered capable of meeting the goals of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Total output from the three projects exceeded the 30 aMW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA agreed to purchase in the solicitation. But because the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the power purchase contracts and the degree of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by other utilities were not known at this time (only one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects had identified a utility partner), and in the interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of meeting program goals, BPA agreed to consider purchasing more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 30 aMW. The Glass Mountain and Vale Projects will, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, be the subject of separate Records of Decision, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be discussed further in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negotiations for the Newberry Project began in January 1992, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were completed in December 1992. The negotiations resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three proposed agreements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A Power Purchase Agreement between CEC and BPA;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A Billing Credits Generation Agreement between EWEB and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A Power Purchase Agreement between CEC and EWEB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its Power Purchase Agreement with CEC, BPA would purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 20 average megawatts of output from the project and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive an option on an additional 67 megawatts, if available in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the future. Under its Power Purchase Agreement with CEC, EWEB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would purchase 10 average megawatts from the project and receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an option on 33 megawatts, if available. BPA would give EWEB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billing credits for 10 average megawatts under a Billing Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generation Agreement. The term of the agreements is 50 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the commercial operation date of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The price of energy will not exceed BPA's Alternative Cost, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in BPA's 1990 Billing Credit Solicitation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Cost is the estimated cost which BPA would incur as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of acquiring new resources, and is the upper limit on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of a billing credit other than conservation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CE Newberry, Inc. (a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiary of the California Energy Company), EWEB, and BPA was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executed on December 17, 1992. The MOU acknowledged that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties had reached agreement on contract principles, and defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the roles of the parties during the environmental review required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by NEPA. The MOU noted that BPA had not made a final decision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sign any power purchase or other agreements, and that such power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase obligation would not arise, if at all, until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts of the proposed Newberry Project had been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed in accordance with NEPA.

Environmental Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national charter for protection of the environment. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes policy, sets goals, and provides means for carrying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out its policy. NEPA requires Federal agencies to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental information available to public officials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA. The NEPA process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to help public officials make decisions that are based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an understanding of environmental consequences. NEPA mandates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Federal agencies use all practical means to protect, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restore, and enhance the quality of the human environment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid or minimize any possible adverse effects of their actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the quality of the human environment.

Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Environmental Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 2, 1992, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with NEPA was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This EIS would analyze the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of various alternatives related to the development of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project (Newberry Project). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) would be the Lead Agency in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process; the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and BPA would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooperating Agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BPA adopted the Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (DOE/EIS&hyph;0207, June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994). The FEIS was tiered to the Resource Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statement (RPEIS&hyph;DOE/EIS&hyph;0162), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered the environmental tradeoffs among the resource types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to meet BPA's need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS evaluated the exploration, development, utilization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and decommissioning phases of the Newberry Project as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related transmission, wheeling, and billing credit components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative A is the CEC/EWEB proposal, and Alternative B is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three Federal agencies' modification of the proposal. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to identifying and analyzing the environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these two alternatives for the proposed Newberry Project, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEIS also evaluated the No Action alternative. The Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purchase and Billing Credits Agreements require that the Newberry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project meet all Federal, state, and local requirements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEIS fulfills the requirements of the National Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy Act (NEPA) and meets the needs of the USFS and the BLM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have documented their decisions in a separate, joint Record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Decision (ROD). BPA has also determined that this action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Council's 1991 Power Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following alternatives were considered in the EIS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative A is the proposal as submitted by CE Exploration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CEE, a subsidiary of the California Energy Company). It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes exploration, development, production, utilization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and decommissioning of the geothermal resources on CEE's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal geothermal leases on the west flank of Newberry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volcano. Highlights of this alternative, which is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in more detail in the FEIS, include development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploration/production well pads at 14 specific locations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and operation of one 33&hyph;MW (gross output) power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant at a specific site; construction of associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pipelines and access roads; construction and utilization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an H-frame, 115-kilovolt transmission line along the north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
side of Forest Road 9735 to deliver power from the plant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an existing transmission line; and mitigation and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures as proposed by CEE. These would be permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities with a contract life of at least 50 years.

Alternative B is a modification of Alternative A developed

of the well field and pads, and design of the facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except for the transmission line. It differs most in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the siting flexibility of well pads, power plant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pipelines, and access roads and the mitigation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring measures to be included. It is described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detail in the FEIS and highlights include development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploration/production well pads at 14 out of 20 possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations; siting the individual well pads within a 40-acre 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or less siting area; construction and operation of one 33&hyph;MW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power plant at one of three possible locations; construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of associated pipelines and access roads; construction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilization of a single pole design 115-kilovolt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission line to the south of Forest Road 9735; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional mitigation and monitoring measures proposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agencies and public. These facilities would also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent, with a contract life of at least 50 years.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative C is the No Action alternative. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative, BPA would not acquire the energy output from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed Newberry Project, thereby foregoing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to supplement BPA's energy supply and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate the availability of geothermal power to help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the region's power needs. BPA would also not provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billing credits to EWEB, with the same results as above, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not provide wheeling services to transmit the energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CEE would not go forth with the project without the power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase agreement, and EWEB would cease further involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without billing credits. This alternative is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmentally preferable, as it would result in no impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the immediate environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the proposed action will not satisfy BPA's total need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical energy, implementing the proposed action will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreclose consideration of other potential BPA resource actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resource types potentially available to meet future load growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were comparatively evaluated in the RPEIS and include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

All of the project alternatives were evaluated against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose and need for the Newberry Project, and only Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A and B would satisfy the need for electrical power. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives would also help BPA meet its contractual obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are consistent with BPA's statutory responsibilities. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the information analyzed and disclosed in the FEIS and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated documents, including the USFS/BLM ROD, BPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the preferred alternative is Alternative B with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions and mitigation and monitoring elements described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the USFS/BLM ROD. The rationale for selecting Alternative B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is summarized in the USFS/BLM ROD by major issues that were of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most concern or apparent controversy. A Mitigation Action Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MAP) developed from the FEIS analysis is available. It requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the specific mitigation requirements described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the FEIS and USFS/BLM ROD.

the Newberry Project, consulted with CEE to satisfy area-wide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state, and local environmental plans and programs, and developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Mitigation Action Plan MAP to assure that all environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are addressed and that all practicable means to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid, minimize, or mitigate environmental impacts have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. It implements the specific mitigation requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the FEIS and USFS/BLM ROD. Development of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newberry Project will be consistent with environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies established by NEPA and the Oregon Energy Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Siting Council (EFSC), and will be consistent with the

The MAP (Attachment 2) for the Newberry Project requires implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigation measures necessary to reduce the environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the FEIS. The USFS, BLM, and BPA all have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for monitoring the progress of the Newberry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project and ensuring that these measures are taken as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. The USFS and BLM responsibilities are detailed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the USFS/BLM ROD. (Attachment 1). BPA will continue to monitor the Newberry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project through its environmental oversight program. The Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purchase and Billing Credits Agreements stipulate the penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for noncompliance with these measures.

Summary of the Proposed Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) proposes to construct:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;About 20.2 miles of 12-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline in Catoosa and Whitfield Counties, Georgia and
Hamilton and Bradley Counties, Tennessee. This proposed pipeline, referred to as the ``Cleveland Branch Line''
would extend from milepost (MP) 101.44 on Southern's existing 12-inch Chattanooga Branch Line in Catoosa County,
Georgia, to a proposed interconnection owned by East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee) in Bradley County,
Tennessee; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One new meter station in Bradley County. The proposed meter station would consist of two 6-inch meter runs,
pressure regulators, flow control valves, about 125 feet of miscellaneous buried piping, and an 8-foot by 10-foot
instrumentation building. This facility would be located adjacent to East Tennessee's existing mainline system
and would require a site of about 150 feet by 150 feet for construction and operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern indicates that the proposed pipeline facilities would deliver a total firm transportation service of about
11,350 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per day to its customer group, which is comprised of various gas distributors and
municipalities served exclusively on a firm basis by East Tennessee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Southern proposes to use a 75-foot-wide right-of-way for construction. Following construction, a 50-foot-wide
easement would be permanently maintained; the remaining 25 feet would be restored and revert back to prior use. About
200.4 acres would be affected by construction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at areas of steep side
slopes, bored road crossings, stream crossings and in most areas where topsoil would be segregated (agricultural
and residential areas). No new access roads would be required.

The EA Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Geology and soils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Vegetation and wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Endangered and threatened species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Land use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cultural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Air quality and noise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project.

Currently Identified Environmental Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed
facilities and the environmental information provided by Southern. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list.
The list of issues may be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The proposed project would cross 37 waterbodies, three of which are perennial. The perennial waterbodies
are Little Tiger Creek, Tiger Creek and Sugar Creek, all located in Catoosa County, Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Some of these waterbodies support valuable riparian vegetation, which helps stabilize soil to prevent erosion
and provides pristine habitat for wildlife. Some creeks may also support fishery resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;About 79 acres of upland forest would be disturbed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;About 6 acres of residential land would be affected by construction; one residence is located within 50 feet
of the proposed construction right-of-way.

Becoming an Intervenor
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered.

Take notice that on October 17, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) tendered for filing as part

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed tariff sheets bear an issue date of October 17, 1994 and proposed effective dates of November 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Columbia states that the instant filing revises the base TCRA rates to (a) reflect the impact of paying an exit fee of
$37,556,308, plus a pre-petition administrative claim of $3,498,728, inclusive of interest, to Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company (Tennessee) on October 7, 1994, (b) remove $34,701,618 of annual demand costs included in the current TCRA
rates that would have been paid under the 858 contracts with Tennessee but for the Exit Fee Settlement, (c) flow through
a refund of $13,708,920 (inclusive of interest) received from Tennessee pursuant to a Commission order issued in
Tennessee's Docket No. RP91&hyph;203, and (d) eliminate the portion of the estimated capacity release revenue attributable
to Tennessee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Columbia requests waiver of the 30-day notice requirement and also requests waiver of the Commission's requirement
in a September 30, 1994 order in Tennessee's Docket No. RP91&hyph;203 that it make a special compliance filing to adjust
its rates to reflect any future refunds in that docket, and requests permission to return any future refund through
the normal operation of the tariff since the refund would only be demand charges for one month amounting to less than
$500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Columbia states that copies of the filing were served upon Columbia's wholesale customers and interested state regulatory
commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules
211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
October 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken,
but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of Columbia's filings are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Take notice that on October 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso) tendered for filing and acceptance, pursuant
to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act certain
restated tariff sheets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states the tendered tariff sheets restate the take-or-pay Throughput Surcharge and Direct Bill amounts for
the period from March 1, 1990 through July 31, 1994 in order to remove certain ineligible costs required by Commission
orders issued on June 16, 1994 at Docket No. RP90&hyph;81&hyph;00, et al., and Docket No. RP91&hyph;26&hyph;000,
et al. The restated Transportation Statement of Rates tariff sheets are included in Original Volume No. 1&hyph;A,
First Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A, Second Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A, and Third Revised Volume No. 2 of El Paso's
FERC Gas Tariff. The restated Direct Bill amounts are included in First Revised Volume No. 1 and Second Revised Volume
No. 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that it is requesting waiver of the notice requirement of Section 154.22 of the Commission Regulations
pursuant to Section 154.51 to permit the tendered tariff sheets to become effective on their indicated dates. El Paso
states that no party will be adversely affected by the waiver since El Paso is merely restating tariff sheets to reflect
revised rates for previously effective periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's affected interstate pipeline system customers
and interested state regulatory commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act (Act) authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prohibit or restrict
the discharge of dredged or fill material at defined sites in the waters of the United States (including wetlands)
whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that use of such sites for disposal would have an
unacceptable adverse impact on various resources, including wildlife. EPA-New England proposes under Section
404(c) of the Act to prohibit use of wetlands and other waters by the proposed Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway
(NHCH) as disposal sites for dredged or fill material. The highway would directly eliminate 40 acres of valuable wetlands
and indirectly degrade or threaten extensive additional wetland habitat. EPA-New England believes that filling
the wetlands and waters of the site may have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife habitat and possibly municipal
water supplies, and that less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives may be available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AND BACKGROUND
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
I. Section 404(c) Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
prohibits the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill material, into the waters of the United States,
including wetlands, except in compliance with, among other requirements, section 404. Section 404 establishes
a federal permit program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material subject to environmental regulations,
known as the 404(b)(1) Guidelines, developed by EPA in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Except
for section 404(c) actions, the Corps may issue permits authorizing dredged and fill material discharges into waters
and wetlands if they comply with, among other requirements, EPA's 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Section 404(c) authorizes
EPA, after providing notice and opportunity for hearing, to prohibit or restrict filling waters of the United States
where it determines that such use would have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife or other specified environmental
interests. EPA can exercise 404(c) to ``veto'' a permit the Corps has decided to issue or to protect valuable aquatic
areas in the absence of any specific permit decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations published in 40 CFR Part 231 establish the procedures to be followed by EPA in exercising its section 404(c)
authority. Whenever the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that use of a site may have an unacceptable adverse
effect on one or more of the pertinent resources, he may begin the process by notifying the Corps of Engineers, the applicant,
and the landowners of the aquatic sites (if different from the applicant), that he intends to issue a proposed determination
under section 404(c). Unless one of these parties persuades the Regional Administrator within 15 days that no unacceptable
adverse effects will occur, the Regional Administrator publishes a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of his proposed determination, soliciting public comment and offering an opportunity for a public hearing. Today's
notice represents this step in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the public hearing and the close of the comment period, the Regional Administrator may either withdraw
the proposed determination or prepare a recommended determination. (A decision to withdraw may be reviewed at the
discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA Headquarters.) If the Regional Administrator prepares
a recommended determination, he then forwards it and the complete administrative record compiled in the Region to
the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA Headquarters. The Assistant Administrator makes the final decision
affirming, modifying, or rescinding the recommended determination.

II. Project Description and History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT) proposes to construct the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential
Highway, a 13 mile limited access toll road in the City of Nashua and the Towns of Hudson, Litchfield and Merrimack in
New Hampshire. A bypass highway, similar to the NHCH, has been proposed for many years. For the past decade EPA has raised
environmental concerns regarding the highway. In its review of an earlier 1984 EIS, EPA recommended permit denial
due to concerns about drinking water impacts at the Pennichuck Reservoir and wetland losses. In 1990 the Army Corps
of Engineers required a revised EIS to focus on these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past three years, EPA reviewed several draft EIS documents, attended numerous meetings with DOT and the
Corps, and conducted many site visits. EPA consistently advised the Corps and NHDOT that potential impacts to the
Pennichuck Reservoir area, wetlands, and other water resources must be avoided and reduced. In 1992, EPA sent several
letters to the Corps stating concerns regarding severity of the aquatic impacts, the need to examine other alternatives,
and the potential adverse drinking water impacts. EPA alerted the Corps that these impacts could cause the highway
to violate the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corps released the revised draft EIS in October 1992. EPA commented to the Corps in March 1993 that the proposed
project violated the 404(b)(1) Guidelines and should be denied a permit and that the project was a candidate for prohibition
under EPA's section 404(c) authority. The Corps issued the final EIS in October 1993. EPA restated its concerns in
a November 1993 comment letter on the final EIS and identified the highway as a likely candidate for action under section
404(c) of the Clean Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At several points in February and March 1994, the Corps indicated its intent to issue a 404 permit for the NHCH, notwithstanding
EPA's objections. On March 31, 1994, EPA began the first step in the 404(c) process by notifying DOT and the Corps that
it believed the filling of the wetlands and other waters may have an unacceptable adverse effect on wildlife habitat
and drinking water resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA subsequently sent the notification letter to the numerous landowners in the right-of-way. The Corps, DOT and
some landowners submitted letters in response to the notice that EPA was commencing the 404(c) process. EPA also met
with DOT and the Corps on May 13 and 26, 1994, and with approximately 20 landowners on June 23, 1994 in Hudson, NH. Because
these consultations did not convince the Regional Administrator that the highway would not cause an unacceptable
impact, he is proceeding to this next step in the process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Characteristics and Functions of the Site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wetlands within the proposed alignment of the NHCH as well as the 100+ square mile study area, as defined in the EIS,
provide high quality, diverse habitat for fish and wildlife, a travel corridor for upland and wetland wildlife, food
web production for on-site and downstream biological communities, nutrient and pollutant uptake and assimilation,
floodwater storage, and flow moderation. Additionally, they serve as an environment for fishing, hunting, bird
watching and other recreational activities. The EIS states that the vast majority of the wetlands provide a wide spectrum
of functions and values. Wildlife habitat rated the highest at most of the sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the wetlands in the study area are riparian systems which border streams that flow to the Merrimack River, including
Limit, Second, Merrill, Glover, Chase, and Pennichuck Brooks. Wetlands bordering streams provide special values.
The streams transport organic material from upstream areas in the watershed to the floodplain wetlands, supporting
food web production for on-site and downstream biological communities. Riverine wetlands also assimilate nutrients
and pollutants, store floodwater, and moderate flows. These riparian corridors are also valuable because of their
high productivity and travel use by wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study area contains valuable wildlife habitat, and includes over 200 different species of birds, mammals, amphibians
and reptiles. The New Hampshire Heritage Program considers over 20% of these species uncommon, rare, threatened,
or endangered in the state. Over 75% of the species in the study area utilize or depend on wetlands or riparian systems
for survival. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the more than 100 bird species that utilize the study area include great blue heron and green-backed heron.
Several wetland birds are uncommon or threatened, including species such as American bittern and eastern screech
owl. Many of these aquatic species need large tracts of land to survive, such as northern waterthrush and belted kingfisher;
others, such as red-shouldered hawk, depend greatly on riparian wetland systems. The bald eagle, a federal endangered
species, uses this portion of the Merrimack River during winter for feeding, roosting and as a travel corridor. A peregrine
falcon, also a federal endangered species, was observed at the Second Brook wetland complex during its migratory
patterns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More than 40 mammal species live in the study area, including otter and mink. These aquatic species also require large
blocks of habitat in which to forage and breed. Some of the mammal species in the study area are considered uncommon
or rare in the state, such as fisher, hoary bat, and southern bog lemming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 30 species of reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the project site such as the uncommon blue spotted salamander;
the vast majority of these species need wetlands for various life functions. Several species of amphibians in New
Hampshire are obligate vernal pool species; that is, they require vernal pools to breed and survive. Moreover, some
of these species, which can live 20 to 25 years, return to their natal pools each year to breed. Therefore, destruction
of these pools may eliminate entire breeding populations of these animals. For example, one obligate species, spotted
salamander, was observed at numerous vernal pools directly on the proposed alignment. Another obligate species,
blue spotted salamander, a state listed species, was also observed at several locations on the proposed alignment.
Painted turtles and other species were also observed using these valuable aquatic systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fish use wetlands as nursery areas and most important recreational fishes spawn in wetlands. Second Brook and Glover
Brook are stocked with trout; the Merrimack River itself likely supports more than 30 fish species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Area-sensitive species such as mink and otter as well as forest interior birds, such as red-shouldered hawk, broad-winged
hawk, northern waterthrush, Canada warbler, barred owl, and black and white warbler live in the study area. These
wetland species typically require large tracts for breeding and decline sharply with habitat fragmentation and
reductions in forest patch sizes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several large blocks of habitat in the study area support these interior, secretive animals. These habitats, generally
associated with the large wetland complexes, are primarily undeveloped tracts of land and water with several corridors
to allow free range of movement. The Second Brook area and lands to the east form a habitat block of approximately 5,000
to 10,000 acres, uncommonly large for this portion of New Hampshire. Large wildlife habitats also exist to the north
in Londonderry and Litchfield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Merrimack River, which flows north to south, dominates the hydrology of the study area and is fed by numerous tributaries
flowing east to west. Since most of the proposed highway heads north and south, the 13 mile road would inevitably cross
and fill a number of tributaries and sub-tributaries to the Merrimack. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wetlands at the site help to maintain and/or improve water quality, as well as regulate water quantity. Wetland plants
and soil trap, assimilate, and transform pollutants entering the watershed. Wetland trees and shrubs retard floodwater,
decreasing downstream flood stages. The basal flow contribution from wetlands to streams during summer stress periods
provides water at the most important time of year.

The Merrimack River is an existing and future source of water supply for a number of communities in New Hampshire and
Massachusetts. In fact, the Merrimack River is a supplemental and emergency supply source for Nashua, although the
intake is upstream from the proposed project. The Merrimack River is currently the primary drinking water source
for a number of communities in Massachusetts (e.g. Lawrence, Lowell, Methuen, and Tewksbury), all of which are downstream
of the proposed project and take raw water directly from the Merrimack River, just prior to treatment. Another community,
Andover, MA, augments its primary supply by pumping water from the Merrimack. In addition, the Merrimack River has
been considered as a future drinking water supply source for several additional communities, many of which are downstream
(e.g. Haverhill, MA, North Andover, MA) of the proposed project.

The NHCH would result in approximately 1.25 miles of roadway and two proposed interchanges within the Pennichuck
Brook drainage watershed. Pennichuck Brook and ponds serve as the primary public water supply for the City of Nashua
and for sections of other neighboring communities. There are many small public water supply systems that rely on drilled
wells in Hudson and Litchfield. In addition, the Southern New Hampshire Water Company has a high yield wellfield in
southern Litchfield.

EPA, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, having recognized the important environmental resources in the area, have
been working to implement a multi-million dollar initiative to protect the aquatic resources of the Merrimack River
Watershed. Considerable time, money and effort have been expended during the past three years to protect water quality
and wildlife habitat. This project would adversely affect the very resources that EPA has targeted for protection
with this watershed initiative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CWA requires that exercise of the final section 404(c) authority be based on a determination of ``unacceptable
adverse effect'' to municipal water supplies, shellfish beds, fisheries, wildlife or recreational areas. EPA's
regulations define ``unacceptable adverse effect'' at 40 CFR 231.2(e) as:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Impact on an aquatic or wetland ecosystem which is likely to result in significant degradation of municipal water
supplies (including surface or groundwater) or significant loss of or damage to fisheries, shellfishing, or wildlife
habitat or recreation areas. In evaluating the unacceptability of such impacts, consideration should be given to
the relevant portions of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the basic functions of section 404(c) is to police the application of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Those
portions of the Guidelines relating to the analysis of less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives
and significant degradation of waters of the United States are particularly important in the evaluation of unacceptability
of environmental impacts in this case. The Guidelines forbid the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters
of the United States if, among other requirements, there is a less environmentally damaging practicable alternative
or if it would cause or contribute to significant degradation of waters of the United States.

 Destruction of wetland acreage correlates with loss of functions and values including habitat destruction, reduced
primary and secondary productivity and alteration of hydrological functions. The NHCH would also cross 18 streams,
causing the direct loss of 3,000 feet of stream bed, place 200 acres of roadway on top of fourteen different high yield
aquifers, and eliminate 600 acres of undeveloped upland habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project would disrupt high quality aquatic ecosystems already experiencing stress from encroaching
development in southern New Hampshire. The large direct loss of wetlands would cause the death and displacement of
wildlife, and reduce water quality functions. Uncommon species would suffer the most, especially area sensitive
animals, species dependent on riparian habitats, and smaller animals that are either less mobile or depend on vernal
pools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project would destroy at least 5 vernal pools. Vernal pools are especially valuable to wildlife, particularly
as breeding areas for amphibians. Given the strong fidelity of numerous aquatic species to their natal ponds, the
direct destruction of the pools results in the loss of a large and important wildlife resource. Several populations
of different species would be lost, including spotted salamander and the rare state listed blue-spotted salamander.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highway would impact one of the last essentially intact ecosystems remaining in the greater Nashua area and cause
impacts well beyond the footprint of the fill. Numerous streams and wetlands would be bisected, thereby altering
the hydrology, disrupting species movement and increasing predation of uncommon species.

Indirect Impacts to Wildlife

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to direct losses, the NHCH would degrade wetlands, including vernal pools, that would border the proposed
highway. When a large highway fragments habitat blocks, common species proliferate at the expense of the more unusual
wetland wildlife species. Fragmentation causes increased nest predation and parasitism to songbird populations.
Large highways act as funnels moving some predators, such as red fox and crows, into previously buffered wetland interior
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riparian corridors help maintain viable wildlife populations by adding to the natural connectivity of habitats
already fragmented by development. Far ranging aquatic mammals inhabiting the site which often travel along streams,
such as fisher and mink, would be impacted adversely. While such species are capable of crossing highways, they often
avoid areas of human disturbance. Fast moving vehicles would kill some of these individuals which venture onto the
highway especially at night. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large highways restrict wildlife movement and interfere with the natural exchange of genetic material. A large highway
with fences, broken canopy, and vehicle activity throughout much of the night presents a significant barrier to the
movement patterns of animals, resulting in increased direct mortality and avoidance behavior. Because of its size
and projected high traffic volume, this highway will likely act as a barrier to restrict the movement of numerous wetland
species across the landscape, especially small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOT has asserted that: (1) local roads and other disturbances have already fragmented the area to some degree; (2)
the undeveloped block of habitat near Second Brook is actually 10,000 acres, not 3,000 or 5,000 acres and the road would
not pass through the center of it; (3) the bridges and culverts would provide for the movement of animals; (4) DOT's
consultant conducted a site specific analysis of the habitats and wildlife; and (5) the vernal pools, several of which
are impaired, do not contain any special species. EPA agrees in part with some of these statements, but nevertheless
believes the NHCH could have unacceptable effects on wildlife. EPA is, however, especially interested in receiving
comment on the five issues raised above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering DOT's statements, EPA has been mindful of several factors. First, while there are local roads in the
area, most of them are roughly 25
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; wide and have tree canopies which cover most of the road. Fragmentation impacts are generally proportional
to the size of the interruption. A 250
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; wide highway such as the NHCH, with activity throughout the day and night would normally cause an order of magnitude
or greater impact than existing conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA agrees that the overall habitat block approximates 10,000 acres, but this fact only underscores the value
of the area for wildlife. That a roadway further east could cross more of the center of the block does not change the severe
impacts of a highway in the present proposed location. Third, we hope that the bridges and culverts would help with
animal movement patterns; however, despite these efforts less than 2% of the roadway will allow passage and, in any
event, there is little known regarding animal use of oversized culverts. These passages would not assist many of the
small species searching for food or breeding sites that cannot find or travel to the nearest potential passageway.
Other long ranging species can and will cross highways without using a culvert and are subject to roadkill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the EIS provided much useful information, it contained relatively few site specific wildlife observations
and the likely impacts of the highway. Thus, EPA contracted with wildlife experts to gain site specific information
lacking in the EIS. Preliminary results for reptiles and amphibians confirm that many of the vernal pools the NHCH
would impact provide high quality breeding habitat for many wetland species, including a rare state listed species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Secondary and Cumulative Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Construction of the highway may also spur secondary development along the route which will degrade additional aquatic
resources. The highway would allow quicker access to the region, encouraging greater development especially for
certain types of projects. Location and access are major siting criteria for many types of commercial and industrial
development. In addition, these projects normally require reasonably large tracts of land increasing the prospects
of adverse impacts to wetland habitat. Over time, additional point and non-point contamination sources may degrade
the quality of both surface and groundwater supply resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the number of permit applications that EPA, the Corps, and the State have reviewed the past 10 years, the greater
Nashua area has experienced some of the most severe cumulative loss of aquatic habitat in New England. The direct and
indirect impacts from the proposed highway would aggravate the severe cumulative loss of habitat and depletion of
biodiversity that has occurred. Furthermore, other large highways proposed in this vicinity, such as the Manchester
Airport highway, the Nashua southwest bypass, and the Windham-Salem Route 111 bypass are currently in the planning
stages. If built, these highways would result in additional cumulative impacts to the wetlands and streams that flow
into this portion of the Merrimack River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Water Quality Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NHCH would also reduce overall water quality as a result of temporary construction related adverse impacts, the
long-term adverse impacts from contamination from highway stormwater runoff, the anticipated secondary and cumulative
impacts associated with newly constructed highways, and the potential for bulk chemical or fuel spills. Greater
amounts of sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants associated with urban runoff, such as heavy metals, oil and
grease, and organic contaminants could enter groundwater and tributary streams and flow into the Merrimack River.
Sedimentation results in turbidity and often transports pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins into the streams,
which adversely affects aquatic life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that DOT proposes to make a substantial effort to reduce impacts to drinking water resources. It plans
to install a closed drainage system near the Pennichuck water supply that diverts a majority of the runoff to a detention
pond downstream of the intake. It also proposes to divert drainage from the F.E. Everett Turnpike (not part of the NHCH),
several bridges (including crossing the Merrimack River), several interchanges, including the Turnpike and Route
102, and other locations, and discharge the contaminated water into lined detention basins for water quality renovation,
prior to being discharged to a surface water source (e.g. the Merrimack River or an associated tributary). DOT also
states it will carefully maintain these structures and ponds and designate a Environmental Coordinator to oversee
the implementation of the plans. In addition, there has been discussion about implementing some type of long-term
water quality monitoring plan to evaluate the effectiveness of selected detention basins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these measures will help considerably, and in the case of the F.E. Everett Turnpike, actually improve an existing
situation, the highway would unavoidably increase overall pollution to these water supply sources. The NHCH would
place over 200 acres of land under pavement and impact a number of surface and groundwater public water supplies by
adding contaminants to these aquatic systems. Stormwater runoff from the highway would degrade both surface and
groundwater. While mitigation measures could reduce these impacts, it is difficult to control fully the pollutants
generated by a large highway crossing many streams and wetlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, long-term problems such as accidents, spills, maintenance and disposal would remain. Detention ponds
hopefully remove the majority of the pollutants, but some pollution passes through and enters aquatic systems. Over
time, detention ponds may become a sink of pollution unless properly and frequently dredged and maintained. In time,
impermeable lining material may be altered in such a way that it could be functioning less efficiently. Also, numerous
portions of the highway would drain directly to groundwater, wetlands and streams.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Secondary development in the watershed, in part spurred by the highway, would worsen water quality concerns. Historical
studies and a recent planning study (I&hyph;190/Wachusett Reservoir Water Supply Protection Study, 1992) support
the fact that the presence of interstate highways encourages development and induces growth. Highways provide the
necessary access to areas where development has not occurred, as well as additional access to existing developed
areas. The Pennichuck Corporation, which owns and operates the Pennichuck Water Supply, controls only 11% (approximately
1800 acres) of the entire Pennichuck Brook watershed. In fact, the Pennichuck Corporation has sold nearly 200 acres
of watershed land in recent years and EPA anticipates continued development within the watershed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHCH could directly or indirectly adversely impact a number of groundwater resources, particularly in the communities
of Hudson and Litchfield along the project corridor. The increased secondary and cumulative growth will be concentrated
at or in the vicinity of the proposed interchanges, within sensitive water supply resource areas. Groundwater degradation
is a nearly inevitable consequence of increased development, increased land use, and industrial development. Additionally,
there is no assurance that new interchanges would not be constructed in the future along this proposed limited access
highway, which would further increase developmental pressures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS also concludes that any of the full or partial build alternatives will degrade or pose a contamination threat
to surface water and groundwater resources as a result of stormwater runoff, the possibility of accidental spills,
and short-term construction impacts. The FEIS presents these impacts to water supply resources as being essentially
unavoidable and states that these potential adverse impacts should be minimized and mitigated, primarily through
the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other structural means. However, the future responsibility of mitigating
any adverse impacts to water supply resources from accelerated or enhanced associated development would be deferred
to local zoning and planning boards.

C. Project Need and Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is clearly a need to reduce or minimize traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area and the Central Business
District (CBD) in particular. This is especially true at the Taylor's Falls Bridge, the only crossing of the Merrimack
River in New Hampshire south of Manchester. Several primary routes converge on the bridge_Routes 111, 102, and 3A.
However, no alternative, including the NHCH, will solve all the traffic difficulties; under all options traffic
problems remain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests public comment on the effectiveness of various alternatives to reduce traffic problems in the Nashua
area, including the NHCH. We also request comment on other alternatives or combinations of options which would cause
considerably less environmental damage, including partial build options, mass transit, reducing existing traffic
during rush hours, and improving or expanding existing local roads (see discussion below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA concurred with the project purpose as originally defined by the Corps: ``to provide a transportation improvement
to assist east-west traffic movements and to reduce congestion on existing bridges and streets in and near the central
business districts of Nashua and Hudson by adding new crossings of the Merrimack River.'' However, the EIS includes
the additional ``goal'' of reducing traffic volumes for the CBD in the year 2010 to a level less than existing traffic
levels, as specifically measured by the percent change in LOS F miles (explained below) from 1990 to 2010. Alternatives
which did not meet this specific goal were eliminated as being ``impracticable.'' Because this test for practicability
is constrained in space (central business district), time (compares two specific years of analysis) and measure
(percentage of miles of level of service F), it artificially eliminated certain alternatives from further consideration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the basic project purpose, in keeping with the requirements of the Guidelines, would be: to reduce a large
portion of the traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area (as defined in the EIS), with greater importance being
given to the Central Business District. This basic project purpose would provide a sound basis to evaluate and judge
the practicability of various options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traffic engineers analyze traffic conditions and future projections using a number of different techniques, including
the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Average daily traffic volume (ADT) for roadway segments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Level of Service (LOS)_for roadway segments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Level of Service (LOS)_for intersections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Free-Flow and Congested Vehicle Hours of Travel (VHT) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Typically highway departments use a peak-hour analysis of existing and projected conditions to determine the need
for highway improvements. Existing and future ``Levels of Service'' are analyzed. LOS is a qualitative measure describing
operational conditions assigned a letter A&hyph;F. LOS A and B represent relatively little traffic and LOS E and F
represent heavy traffic conditions and vehicular delay for at least peak hours (prime commuting hours). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of these methods were used with Nashua to predict future traffic conditions (2010) in three separate locations:

The proposed NHCH provides some traffic relief for the central business district. Using DOT data and models, the full
build would remove LOS F
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; in the CBD (F
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; is worse than F), while, for example, if a partial build highway from Route 102 north to the Turnpike were constructed,
1.2 miles of LOS F
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; would remain.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the CBD in 2010 with the NHCH built, 4.5 miles of traffic congestion (LOS F
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;, F, &amp; E) would result. Under the no build condition, 8.9 miles of congestion would remain (LOS F
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;, F, &amp; E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the proposed NHCH does not provide substantial traffic relief for the entire study area. Using DOT's data
and models, any traffic measurement_ADT, LOS for intersections, LOS for road segments_shows modest traffic improvements
for the NHCH. In the study area in 2010, 27.3 miles of congestion (LOS E, F, and F
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;) would remain. Under a no build alternative 39.7 miles of congestion would result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When one examines the vehicle hours of travel (VHT), it appears that the partial build option supplies a substantial
portion of traffic relief that the NHCH would provide. The percent of free-flow traffic would be 69% for the NHCH verses
66% for the partial build from Route 102 north to the Turnpike. The following table summarizes the congested and free-flow
hours of travel:

DOT's models may also overestimate traffic benefits from a full build highway. For example, the model assumes the
same future traffic growth in the study area, with or without the highway. EPA's experience with other highways in
New England suggests that they do alter land use and development patterns. We have no reason to believe that this highway
would be any different. If the highway generates more development, the corresponding increase in traffic could increase
levels beyond current projections for the full build (or reduce projections for the no build option). We request comment
from the public on whether the highway will likely spur additional development and traffic growth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased traffic in the study area resulting from the NHCH could place additional burdens on the two North-South
roads in the region, I&hyph;93 and especially the F.E. Everett Turnpike. Both of these roads are proposed for widening
in the near future, and major portions of the Turnpike will be at LOS F conditions even after expansion. Even with the
EIS assuming no increased growth in traffic caused by the highway, the EIS shows that parts of the Turnpike already
experiencing LOS F conditions will receive greater traffic volumes once the NHCH is in place. This condition would
worsen if the NHCH generates additional traffic to the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current analysis gives little weight to toll avoidance. However, this is a factor that could cause the full build
to reduce congestion less than projected in the CBD because the Taylor's Falls Bridge, the primary focal point of traffic
in the CBD, would be the only non-toll road remaining in New Hampshire to cross the Merrimack River south of Manchester.
(The Sagamore Bridge, currently free, would require a toll once it is part of the NHCH.) Some percentage of vehicles
currently using the Sagamore Bridge would avoid paying the toll by using either the Taylor's Falls Bridge, or the Tyngsborough
Bridge, five miles south in Massachusetts. The EIS did not discuss the issue of tolls and toll avoidance, and EPA requests
comment on these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed highway would only provide partial traffic relief for the overall traffic patterns in the
greater Nashua area. Other measures of reducing traffic volumes, which cause much less impact to the environment,
may also provide some portion of the relief that the NHCH would provide. Such measures and combinations of measures
could include partial build options, traffic demand management measures (TDM), traffic systems management (TSM),
and local improvements.

Partial Build Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Partial build alternatives would involve constructing one or more segments of the NHCH but something short of the
full highway proposed by DOT. All the partial build alternatives discussed below have substantially less impact
to wildlife because the partial build options would not fragment the 10,000 acre habitat block, would not destroy
several valuable vernal pools, and it would avoid nine streams and other valuable wetlands. Partial build alternatives
include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Southern Bridge. This option would be an expansion of the Sagamore bridge in the south from the F.E. Everett
Turnpike in Nashua to Route 3A in Hudson, allowing direct access from the Turnpike across the Merrimack River to Hudson.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Two Bridges. This option would include expansion of the Sagamore bridge in the south from the F.E. Everett Turnpike
in Nashua to Route 3A in Hudson and construction of a new bridge in the north also from the F.E. Everett Turnpike in Merrimack
to Route 3A in Litchfield. Thus, it would provide a new crossing of the Merrimack River between Nashua and Manchester.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Partial Build to Route 102. Identical to the above alternative, this option would also extend the northern
section two miles east to Route 102 in Litchfield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Partial Build to Route 111. This alternative is the same as above, plus an extension of the northern section
another four miles southeast to Route 111. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Partial build alternatives, as measured by LOS of segments, appear to do relatively little to improve traffic in the
CBD. However, as measured by average daily traffic, the partial build option from Route 102 north to the F.E. Everett
Turnpike, for example, would provide over 50% of the traffic benefits of the full build in the CBD and over 75% of the
traffic benefits of the full build for the entire traffic network. DOT states in several documents that a bridge to
the north would provide traffic benefits to the study area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, DOT has also stated that the partial build options will not provide traffic relief or could even make the traffic
situation worse, including adding more traffic on local roads, such as Route 3A. We understand that local roads in
the area will be busier with more cars in the future, but that may be true if the NHCH is built as well. EPA seeks comment
on this issue as well.

TDM/TSM Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Traffic demand measures (TDM) reduce the number of vehicles on roadways especially during peak travel times when
the worst congestion occurs. Traffic system management (TSM) refers to infrastructure improvements to enhance
the efficiency of vehicle movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT and the Nashua Regional Planning Commission have already made important strides in acquiring funds in recent
years to pursue some TDM/TSM measures. Some of the projects which have been funded or for which they are pursuing funding
include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional and expanded TDM and planning techniques for managing and reducing peak congestion, which appear to have
the greatest potential in the greater Nashua area include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) organized operation of mini-vans for car-pooling and ride-sharing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) better management, operation, and extension of the local bus system; (3) changing future land use development
patterns to encourage cluster developments;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) parking disincentives;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) removing disincentives to implement and utilize mass transit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) extending rail service to the greater Nashua and Manchester area from Boston;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) telecommunications in lieu of travel; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) incentives to business for implementing staggered work hours and many of the measures listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important that TDM measures be combined with TSM to prevent the improved mobility from attracting new users and
leading to future congestion problems. Traffic flow improvements could include signal system timing/optimization,
addition of turning lanes, restrictions of single occupant vehicles (to enhance HOV operations and attract users),
fringe park and ride lots, and pedestrian/non-motorized improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Local road improvements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Local improvements include anything that expands capacity on the basic existing traffic network, for example, improving
traffic flow across the Taylor's Falls Bridge. While some TDM/TSM measures could also be listed under this category,
other local improvements could involve adding additional lanes, overpasses, mini-bypasses, or other structural
changes. Since the EIS does not focus on this issue very much, EPA would appreciate comments on needed improvements
to the existing traffic network.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Mitigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current mitigation plan consists of avoiding, minimizing and compensating for environmental losses. DOT has
endeavored to minimize impacts by proposing: 1. two bridges and five box culverts at some of the stream locations;
2. closed drainage systems to divert and treat runoff in order to minimize impacts to drinking water resources; 3.
26
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; median widths at wetland locations; 4. 2:1 side slopes to minimize impacts; and 5. two retaining walls to reduce
impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compensatory mitigation portions of the plan consist of the following: 1. attempted creation or restoration
of 44 acres of wetlands mainly at the former Benson's Wild Animal Farm; 2. bringing Merrill Brook above ground at Benson's;
3. constructing water detention basins adjacent to the roadway; 4. preserving an additional 100 acres at Benson's
and 135 acres along an old alignment that DOT owns in the southern portion of the site; and 5. protecting water supply
by capturing part of the runoff from the existing F.E. Everett Turnpike. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, DOT has proposed a substantial mitigation plan, especially to minimize impacts. However, EPA believes
that the environmental benefits, especially for wildlife, of the proposed compensation plan fall well short of the
impacts the NHCH would cause. While creation and restoration may be beneficial to the aquatic environment, especially
when applied at a low value site in a relatively undisturbed landscape setting, wetland creation suffers from both
theoretical limitations and practical problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the poor track record associated with wetland creation suggests that it would be unwise to rely on this mitigation
to provide all of the intended benefits. Some wetland functions, such as flood storage, can normally be replicated
successfully. Attempts to mitigate wildlife habitat losses have met with mixed success, and benefit only a few select
species. There has been little or no demonstrated ability to recreate other wetland values such as groundwater discharge
and recharge or the complex interactions of water, soil and plants involved in the uptake and transformation of nutrients
and pollutants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOT has made an effort to address this uncertainty by offering to construct the mitigation at Benson's before the highway
can proceed. This would allow the success or failure at Benson's to be evaluated with greater certainty. EPA believes
that demonstrating success at the Benson's site or other selected sites prior to highway construction makes sense
and should be part of any mitigation plan should the NHCH be partially or fully constructed. However, even if successful,
it would not alter the insufficiency of the current mitigation plan. The creation site borders 3 roads, including
the busy Route 111. The potential for human alteration and disturbance, from off road vehicles and other human intrusion,
would remain, as well as the impacts to wildlife from fragmentation and being hit by cars and trucks. Thus, restoring
the site would only offset a modest amount of the impacts the highway would cause to uncommon species in the study area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the proposed mitigation would not replace many lost functions and values. It would not compensate for fragmenting
one of the last large undeveloped tracts remaining in the study area, which provides an oasis for many species of wildlife.
The plan would not replace riparian streams, floodplains or the spectrum of natural resource values these areas provide.
Also, it would do little to offset the large indirect, secondary, and cumulative impacts the highway would inevitably
cause or contribute to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While preservation cannot replace the direct and indirect impacts from fragmentation, it can reduce the likely secondary
and cumulative impacts. However, the current preservation proposal appears insufficient to provide substantial
environmental benefits. The 100 acres at Benson's, while useful to buffer the creation area, would be located between
the new highway and the developed portions of Hudson, providing only modest wildlife access and benefits. The 135
acres, which is part of the old right-of-way, protects some useful habitat; however, it is a long linear parcel and
some of it lies inside of or adjacent to the NHCH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three areas appear to be especially valuable and vulnerable to secondary impacts in the future: (1) the 5,000&hyph;10,000
acre block in the southeastern portion of the study area; (2) a large wetland and upland complex in the southern part
of Litchfield and Londonderry, containing several rare species and bordering other protected lands; and (3) floodplain
forest and farmland along the Merrimack River in Litchfield. We request comment on the adequacy of the current preservation
package and whether additional preservation options, such as portions of those described above, could offset the
likely secondary and cumulative impacts of the highway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the project's impacts and the uneven track record of wetland creation and enhancement projects
to compensate for projects involving much less severe impacts, EPA has concluded that the adverse effects of the highway
will be difficult to mitigate sufficiently to render them environmentally acceptable. The mitigation plan described
in the EIS and other documents would not compensate for the severe impacts to wildlife which the project would cause.

V. Proposed Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the current proposal, the Regional Administrator proposes to recommend that the discharge of dredged or
fill material into wetlands and other waters associated with the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway be prohibited.
This action would not prohibit other uses of the land on the alignment, nor would it preclude possible permitting of
partial build alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed determination is based primarily on the adverse impacts to wildlife. EPA has already concluded and
stated in previous letters that the project would cause or contribute to significant degradation of waters of the
United States and violate the &sect;404(b)(1) Guidelines. It would directly destroy 40 acres of wetlands in an area
beset with cumulative impacts, and will degrade additional wetlands through secondary and indirect impacts. Based
on current information, the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that the adverse impacts of the Nashua-Hudson
Circumferential Highway would be unacceptable. Moreover, these impacts may be in part avoidable.

VI. Solicitation of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA solicits comments on all issues discussed in this notice. In particular, we request information on the likely
adverse impacts to wildlife and other functional values of the streams and wetlands at the site. We also seek information
pertaining to plants, animals and hydrology of the site and adjacent lands. All studies of the natural resource values
of the area or informal observations would be helpful. Information on species or communities of regional and/or statewide
importance would be especially useful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the significant loss of wildlife habitat serves as EPA's main basis for this proposed 404(c) determination,
New England has additional concerns with the proposed project including water quality and drinking water impacts,
alternatives, and mitigation. In particular, EPA solicits comments on particular aspects of the project including:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The presence and likely impacts to fish and wildlife resources using the study area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The potential for indirect impacts from the NHCH to fish and wildlife resources, such as fragmentation, noise
and roadkill; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The extent to which local roads and other disturbances have or have not fragmented the study area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The extent to which the bridges and culverts would or would not provide for the movement of animals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The potential for secondary wetland losses, through additional development that would benefit from access to
the highway; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Evidence of past and likely future cumulative impacts to the aquatic environment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Information on potential for drinking water and other water quality impacts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Information on whether the new highway would generate additional traffic and land use changes compared to a no-build
alternative; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The extent to which additional traffic would travel across the Taylor's Falls Bridge and the Tyngsborough Bridge
to avoid paying tolls on the Sagamore Bridge or the northern bridge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The extent to which partial build options would provide traffic relief or make the traffic situation worse, including
adding more traffic on local roads, such as Route 3A; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of the NHCH in reducing traffic congestion;

The record will remain open for comments until December 6, 1994. All comments will be fully considered in reaching
a decision to either withdraw the proposed determination or forward to EPA Headquarters a recommended determination
to prohibit or restrict the use of the wetlands as a disposal site for construction of Nashua-Hudson Circumferential
Highway.

 Toxicity Guidelines for inhalation studies were issued in 1982. Since then, numerous inadequacies have been identified,
particularly with regards to aerosol particle size and limit concentration requirements. In 1991, EPA's Health
Effects Division (HED) requested public comments on its Inhalation Guidelines. These critiques, combined with
numerous interviews with inhalation toxicologists, demonstrated these issues to be universal concerns. HED evaluated
the state of the science with particular emphasis on the physical and biological realities of performing inhalation
toxicity studies. The results of this investigation led to an Interim Policy which considers four major areas of controversy:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Particle size requirements for aerosol products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Limit concentration for aerosols, gases, and vapors in acute studies, and revised Toxicity Categories.

The Interim Policy was presented to a Science Advisory Panel on December 15, 1993, for comment. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Report of the Joint FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel and Science Advisory Board Meeting
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 states that, ``The Panel concurs with the Agency's recommendations and further that these guideline revisions reflect
the current state-of-the-art for inhalation toxicity tests which are consistent with aerosol toxicology.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather than waiting for a comprehensive revision of the inhalation guidelines, EPA has chosen to disseminate the
Interim Policy at this time because its recommendations have significant impact on the performance of studies and
regulation of pesticide products.

 EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy which streamlines the registration process by identifying minor
registration amendments which may be (1) submitted as notifications, (2) not submitted at all (non-notifications),
or (3) which can be processed faster if they are minor formulation changes. That policy is described in a draft Pesticide
Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Notifications, Non-Notifications and Minor Formulation Amendments.'' Interested
parties may request this document as described in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is proposing to expand the current list of amendment actions which may be accomplished without prior Agency
approval. The policy will streamline the registration process to allow certain minor, low risk amendments to be achieved
by notification, non-notification or by accelerated review. If adopted, this policy would speed the approval of
such amendments and free Agency resources to focus on more important actions while maintaining protection to public
health and the environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. In particular,
the Agency invites comment on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A process for accelerating the processing of minor formulation amendments is being proposed to speed up the review
of changes of inert ingredients which are believed not to change the toxicological or chemical properties of products.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of this approach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A certification statement is being proposed which would be submitted with each notification indicating that the
amendment complies with the PR Notice, that a product may be subject to enforcement action or cancellation by order
without a hearing if it is not consistent with the PR Notice. The intent of this certification is to assure registrants
comply with the notice and that they understand the consequences of not complying. What are the pros and cons of the
certification statement? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. EPA proposes allowing several additional kinds of amendments to be accomplished by notification_addition of
pests, addition of non-food, indoor sites, and addition of directions related to packaging. Changes in directions
for use is currently prohibited by 40 CFR 151.46(b)(1). Does EPA have discretion to allow the proposed changes under
40 CFR 152.44(b)(1)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing public comments received, EPA may make changes to the Policy and revise the draft PR Notice prior to
release.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463), the Environmental Protection Agency gives
notice of a meeting of the Effluent Guidelines Task Force (EGTF). The EGTF is a subcommittee of the National Advisory
Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT), the external policy advisory board to the Administrator
of EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EGTF was established in July of 1992 to advise EPA on the Effluent Guidelines Program, which develops regulations
for dischargers of industrial wastewater pursuant to Title III of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Task Force consists of members appointed by EPA from industry, citizen groups, state and local government,
the academic and scientific communities, and EPA regional offices. The Task Force was created to offer advice to the
Administrator on the long-term strategy for the effluent guidelines program, and particularly to provide recommendations
on a process for expediting the promulgation of effluent guidelines. The Task Force generally does not review specific
effluent guideline regulations currently under development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting agenda will include continued discussions on draft recommendations concerning subcategorization
of industries in effluent guidelines. There will also be consideration of a draft report on methodology for conducting
preliminary industry studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting is open to the public. Limited seating for the public is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
The public may submit written comments to the Task Force regarding improvements to the Effluent Guidelines program.
Comments should be sent to EPA at the above address. Comments submitted will be transmitted to Task Force members for
consideration.

This notice announces the availability of a report entitled ``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from
a Risk Assessment Perspective Volume II''. The report includes five peer-reviewed case studies that explore the
relationship between the ecological risk assessment process as described in the EPA report ``Framework for Ecological
Risk Assessment'' (EPA 630/R&hyph;92/001) and several types of ecological assessments done by EPA and others. The
report is a companion volume to a previously published set of 12 case studies (``Review of Ecological Assessment Case
Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective'', EPA/630/R&hyph;92/005).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, EPA's Risk Assessment Forum published an evaluation of 12 ecological assessment case studies from a risk
perspective (``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective'', EPA/630/R&hyph;92/005).
To complement this original set of case studies, five new case studies were developed and peer reviewed to provide
further insight into the ecological risk assessment process. The new case studies expand the range of the first case
study set by including different kinds of stressors (radionuclides, genetically-engineering organisms, and physical
alteration of wetlands) and programmatic approaches (Pre-Manufacture Notice assessments under the Toxic Substances
Control Act and the EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program). Both case studies reports provide useful
perspectives concerning the application of ecological risk assessment principles to a range of problems.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Communications Commission has adopted a Further Order Inviting Comments on selected accounts and proposed
projection life and future net salvage ranges for use by local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under its price
cap regulatory scheme. The Further Order Inviting Comments identifies eight accounts for which the Commission proposes
to establish ranges for use beginning in 1995. The Commission has also proposed different simplification methods
for four other accounts. The rule change is intended to lessen the depreciation prescription burden on price cap LECs
in light of regulatory and market changes without sacrificing protection for consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted streamlined depreciation prescription procedures for the local exchange carriers
(``LECs'') regulated under our price cap incentive regulatory plan.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 These procedures require us to establish ranges for the future net salvage and projection life estimates that are
used to compute depreciation rates for plant categories. The new procedures generally permit price cap LECs to make
streamlined filings for changes in depreciation rates for these categories, as long as these estimates fall within
the prescribed ranges. In our

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 35632 (July 13, 1994), we adopted underlying factor ranges for 22 depreciation rate categories. By this

Further Order Inviting Comments, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2. Prior to adoption of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depreciation Simplification Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the depreciation prescription process required carriers to submit extensive data to support the underlying depreciation
basic factors that are the future net salvage, projection life, and survivor curve estimates used to compute proposed
depreciation rates. These data requirements often resulted in voluminous submissions, consisting of up to 25 pages
of analysis for each of 34 plant categories. In recognition of the regulatory, technological, and market changes
that price cap LECs face, we decided to simplify the process by establishing ranges that specify maximum and minimum
amounts for two of the basic depreciation factors, the future net salvage and projection life estimates. Under our
new process, if a price cap LEC meeting the requisite criteria selects future net salvage and projection life estimates
that are within the established ranges, it need not submit the detailed supporting data otherwise required. In addition,
under the new procedures, price cap LECs can change these basic factors annually, as opposed to the current triennial
represcription cycle. These streamlined procedures are intended to simplify the depreciation process, achieve
administrative savings, and allow the price cap LECs greater flexibility in the depreciation process, while continuing
an appropriate oversight of their depreciation rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We determined that the new, streamlined procedures should be implemented in two phases, beginning with the accounts
most readily adaptable to the range approach. We have completed phase one of the streamlining process and adopted
ranges for 22 plant categories. We now begin phase two by proposing ranges for eight of the remaining categories. If
we implement these proposals, we will have established ranges of projection life and future net salvage factors for
30 of the 34 plant categories. These plant categories represent 85% of the total plant investment. In addition, we
propose in this notice alternate simplified procedures for the other four accounts. We solicit public comment on
the following proposals for phase two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. We propose to establish ranges for eight of the remaining twelve plant categories. (See Appendix). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depreciation Simplification Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we set forth a number of specific data that should be considered in establishing the projection life and future net
salvage ranges, and we used these data to formulate the ranges listed in the attached Appendix. For each plant category,
we first developed a range of one standard deviation from the mean of each of the projection life and the future net salvage
basic factors underlying the currently prescribed LEC depreciation rates. We then determined whether there are
technological trends or recent changes in carrier investment plans that might not be fully reflected in the LECs'
prescribed factors. Finally, we considered the number of LECs with basic factors that fall within the initial ranges
and altered the ranges where appropriate. We recognized, however, that these specifically enumerated data must
be considered in light of our obligation to prescribe reasonable depreciation rates: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We wish to make the ranges wide enough to accommodate a significant number, if not all, of the LECs. On the other hand,
we must not make the ranges so wide that they would no longer enable us to exercise effective oversight of depreciation
rates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, in developing the proposed ranges, we considered both the specific data enumerated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Depreciation Simplification Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and our overriding responsibility to prescribe reasonable depreciation rates. We set forth in the Appendix our proposed
projection life and future net salvage ranges for these light plant categories.

5. We do not propose to establish ranges for Account 2211, Analog Electronic Switching; Account 2215, Electro-mechanical
Switching; and Account 2431, Aerial Wire. These are ``dying accounts'' as LECs are replacing the plant in these accounts
with newer technologies. The LECs are rapidly phasing out this obsolete equipment in accordance with specific retirement
schedules that are based on company plans to modernize their networks. Depreciation rates for this equipment can
be readily calculated from these retirement schedules. We believe that depreciation rates for such equipment that
are based upon a LEC's specific retirement plans are more accurate than rates based upon national averages. Moreover,
the calculations are less complicated than those for other plant accounts, since detailed statistical analyses
are not required to forecast lives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In addition, we do not propose to set ranges for Account 2121, Buildings. For depreciation study purposes, we have
permitted the LECs to subdivide this account and estimate lives for each subcategory. Moreover, we allowed the LECs
flexibility to develop individual methods of categorization. As a result, some LECs subdivided this account based
on the size of the buildings, some by location, and others based on use. Because of the significant differences among
the categorization methods, the LECs' current basic factors for the subaccounts cannot be used to establish nationwide
ranges. If ranges are to be developed for the buildings account, the LECs' data must be recast into new, uniform subcategories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. We believe that the cost of establishing such subcategories would outweigh the benefits. The LECs have indicated
that the cost of compiling the information necessary to develop new subcategories would be substantial. Moreover,
the LECs do not have plans to add or retire a significant number of buildings in the next few years. As a result, the underlying
depreciation factors applicable to Account 2121 likely will not change, and an extensive analysis of the building
account probably will not be necessary within the next few years. Accordingly, we propose to maintain the basic factors
underlying the current prescribed depreciation rates for the buildings account, until our three-year range review
when we will reconsider whether ranges would be appropriate for this account. In the interim, we believe that the data
required under the streamlined procedures will be adequate, and we propose to require that the price cap LECs provide
only these data for the buildings account.

8. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding.

presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided
in the Commission's rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this proceeding because if the proposals
in this Order Inviting Comments are adopted, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Because of the nature
of local exchange and exchange access service, the Commission has concluded that small telephone companies are dominant
in their fields of operation and therefore are not ``small entities'' as defined by that Act. The Secretary shall send
a copy of this Order Inviting Comments, including this certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration in accordance with Section 603(a) of that Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. We invite comment on the proposals set forth above. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in Sections 1.415
and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, interested parties may file comments on or before November 14, 1994, and reply
comments on or before December 14, 1994. To file formally in this proceeding, interested parties must file an original
and four copies of all comments and reply comments. If commenters want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy
of their comments, they must file an original plus nine copies. Interested parties should send comments and reply
comments to Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. Parties should
also file one copy of any documents filed in this docket with the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Services, Room 246, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554. We also ask that parties send a courtesy copy of their
comments to the Accounting and Audits Division, 2000 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Comments and reply comments
will be available for public inspection during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239) of the
Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated October 19, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Georgia, resulting from severe weather, heavy rains,
flooding, high winds and tornadoes on October 1, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to
warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the
Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of Georgia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are authorized to provide individual Assistance in the designated areas. Public Assistance may be added at a later
date, if warranted. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds
provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.

The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Glenn C. Woodard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as
the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Acting under the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. 2201 note, the United States Fire Administration
has worked with each State to compile a national master list of all of the places of public accommodation affecting
commerce located in each State that meet the requirements of the guidelines under the Act. FEMA published the national
master list in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on Tuesday, November 29, 1993, 58 FR 62718, and published changes approximately monthly since then. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parties wishing to be added to the National Master List, or to make any other change, should contact the State office
or official responsible for compiling listings of properties which comply with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act.
A list of State contacts was published in 58 FR 17020 on March 31, 1993. If the published list is unavailable to you, the
State Fire Marshal's office can direct you to the appropriate office. Periodically FEMA will update and redistribute
the national master list to incorporate additions and corrections/changes to the list, and deletions from the list,
that are received from the State offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each update contains or may contain three categories: ``Additions;'' ``Corrections/changes;'' and ``Deletions.''
For the purposes of the updates, the three categories mean and include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Additions'' are either names of properties submitted by a State but inadvertently omitted from the initial master
list or names of properties submitted by a State after publication of the initial master list; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Corrections/changes'' are corrections to property names, addresses or telephone numbers previously published
or changes to previously published information directed by the State, such as changes of address or telephone numbers,
or spelling corrections; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Deletions'' are entries previously submitted by a State and published in the national master list or an update to
the national master list, but subsequently removed from the list at the direction of the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the national master list and its updates may be obtained by writing to the Government Printing Office, Superintendent
of Documents, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325. When requesting copies please refer to stock number 069&hyph;001&hyph;00049&hyph;1.

&sect;&sect;1709(b) (1), (4), (10), (12), (14) and (15) by knowingly and willfully accepting cargo for the account
of various shippers of household goods who are NVOCCs without tariffs or bonds on file with the Commission; by entering
into unlawful service contracts with these shippers resulting in rates for them that discriminate against complainant;
and by allowing these shippers to obtain transportation at less than the rates contained in Respondents' tariffs
through unjust and unfair devices or means.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Congress has recognized that Department of Defense activities may have caused environmental problems for Indian
tribes and Alaska Natives. These environmental hazards can negatively impact the health and safety as well as their
social and economic welfare. Accordingly, the Congress has taken steps to help those affected begin to mitigate environmental
impacts from Department of Defense activities by assisting them in the planning, development and implementation
of programs for such mitigation.

(the Act), enacted on September 30, 1994. Section 8094 of the Act states, ``Of the funds appropriated to the Department
of Defense (DOD) for Operations and Maintenance Defense_Wide, not less than $8,000,000 shall be made available until

shall be made available only for the mitigation of environmental impacts, including training and technical assistance
to tribes, related administrative support, the gathering of information, documenting of environmental damage,
and developing a system for prioritizing of mitigation, on Indian lands resulting from Department of Defense activities:
Provided further, That the Department of Defense shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate
and House of Representatives by September 30, 1995, a summary report of all environmental damage that has occurred

for Native Americans for the purpose of mitigating environmental impacts on Indian lands related to Department of
Defense activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Financial assistance awards made under this program announcement will be on a competitive basis and the proposals
will be reviewed against the evaluation criteria in this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal government recognizes that substantial environmental problems, resultant from defense activities,
exist on Indian lands and will geographically range from border to border and from coast to coast. The nature and magnitude
of the problems will most likely be better defined when affected Indian tribes and Alaska Natives have completed environmental
assessments called for in Phase I of this four-phase program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Federal government has also recognized that Indian tribes, Alaska Natives and their tribal organizations must
have the opportunity to develop their own plans and technical capabilities and access the necessary financial and
technical resources in order to assess, plan, develop and implement programs to mitigate any impacts caused by Department
of Defense activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) recognize the potential environmental
problems created by DOD activities that may affect air, water, soil and human and natural resources (i.e., forests,
fish, plants). It is also recognized that potential applicants may have specialized knowledge and capabilities
to address specific concerns at various levels within the four phase program. Under this announcement proposals
will be accepted for any and all of the four phases or one specific phase. These phases are: Phase I_assessment of Indian
lands to develop as complete an inventory as possible of environmental impacts caused by Department of Defense activities;
Phase II_identification and exploration of alternative means for mitigation of these impacts and determination
of the technical merit, feasibility and expected costs and benefits of each approach in order to select one approach;
Phase III_development of a detailed mitigation plan, and costing and scheduling for implementation of the design,
including strategies for meeting statutory or regulatory requirements and for dealing with other appropriate Federal
agencies; and, Phase IV_implementation of the mitigation plan.

&bull;identify other Federal environmental restoration programs that could be accessed to cooperatively coordinate
and mobilize resources in addressing short and long-term activities developed under Phase III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phase I should result in adequately detailed documentation of the problems and sources of help in solving them to provide
a useful basis for examining alternative mitigation approaches in Phase II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase II: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of Phase II activities is to examine alternative approaches for mitigation of the impacts identified
in Phase I and to lead toward the mitigation design to be developed in Phase III. Phase II activities may include, but
need not be limited to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;conduct remedial investigation and/or feasibility studies as necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;plan for the design of a comprehensive mitigation strategy to address problems identified during Phase I which
address areas such as land use restoration, clean-up processes, contracting and liability concerns; regulatory
responsibilities; and resources necessary to implement clean up actions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;design strategies that coordinate with or are complementary to existing DOD cleanup programs such as the Defense
Environmental Restoration Program which promotes and coordinates efforts for the evaluation and cleanup of contamination
at DOD installations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;review possible interim remedial strategies that address immediate potential hazards to the public health
and environment in order to provide alternative measures i.e., providing alternate water supplies, removing concentrated
sources of contaminants, or constructing structures to prevent the spread of contamination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;identify specific types of technical assistance and management expertise required to assist in developing
specific protocols for environmental assessments, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, interim remedial
actions and strategic planning for existing and future mitigation activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;review other types of assessments that need to be considered, reviewed and incorporated into the conduct and/or
design process such as:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;document approaches and procedures which have been developed in order to negotiate with appropriate Federal
agencies for necessary cleanup action and to keep the public informed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing the basis for a design process, particularly when there are multiple problems, the applicants may
want to consider a prioritization process as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;emergency situations that require immediate clean-up; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;time-critical sites, i.e. sites where the situation will deteriorate if action is not taken soon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;projects with minimum funding requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;projects with intermediate-level funding requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;projects with maximum funding requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Achieving compliance with Federal environmental protection legislation is the driving force behind all Federal
clean-up activities. The following is a list of major Federal environmental legislation that should be recognized
in a regulatory review as all Federal, state and local regulatory requirements which could have major impacts in the
design of mitigation strategies:

E. Multi-Year Projects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to 36 months. Awards, on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be as long as 36 months. Funding after the 12 month
budget period of an approved multi-year project is non-competitive. The non-competitive funding for the second
and third years is contingent upon the grantee's satisfactory progress in achieving the objectives of the project
according to the approved work plan, the availability of Federal funds, compliance with the applicable statutory,
regulatory and grant requirements, and determination that continued funding is in the best interest of the Government.

F. Grantee Share of Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must provide at least five (5) percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of
the project is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind
contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions.
The funds for the match must be from a private source, or state source where the funds were not obtained from the Federal
government by the state, or a Federal source where legislation or regulation authorizes the use of these funds for
matching purposes. Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $100,000 per budget
period), must include a match of at least $15,789 (5% total project cost). Applicants may request a waiver of the requirement
for a 5% non-Federal matching share. Since the matching requirement is very low it is not expected that waivers will
be requested. However, the procedure for requesting a waiver can be found in 45 CFR 1336, Subpart E_Financial Assistance
Provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is the policy of ANA to apply the waiver of the non-Federal matching share requirement for the purposes of this particular

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Application Consideration: The Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans determines the final
action to be taken with respect to each grant application received under this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following points should be taken into consideration by all applicants: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Incomplete applications and applications that do not otherwise conform to this announcement will not be accepted
for review. Applicants will be notified in writing of any such determination by ANA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Complete applications that conform to all the requirements of this program announcement are subjected to
a competitive review and evaluation process. An independent review panel consisting of reviewers familiar with
environmental problems of Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages will evaluate each application against the published
criteria in this announcement. The results of this review will assist the Commissioner in making final funding decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Commissioner's decision will also take into account the comments of ANA staff, state and Federal agencies
having performance related information, and other interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As a matter of policy the Commissioner will make grant awards consistent with the stated purpose of this announcement
and all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements under 45 C.F.R. Parts 74 and 92 applicable to grants under
this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After the Commissioner has made decisions on all applications, unsuccessful applicants will be notified
in writing within approximately 120 days of the closing date. Successful applicants are notified through an official
Financial Assistance Award (FAA) document. The Administration for Native Americans staff cannot respond to requests
for funding decisions prior to the official notification to the applicants. The FAA will state the amount of Federal
funds awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award,
the project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-Federal matching share requirement.

I. Review Process and Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applications submitted by the post-marked date under this program announcement will undergo a pre-review to determine
that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The applicant is eligible in accordance with the Eligible Applicants Section of this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The application materials submitted are sufficient to allow the panel to undertake an in-depth evaluation
(All required materials and forms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by an independent review panel on the basis of the
evaluation criteria. These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project, and to determine the likelihood
of its success. A proposed project should reflect the purposes stated and described in the Introduction and Program
Purpose (Section A) of this announcement. No additional weight or preference is given to applications because of
an increased number of phases proposed. Also, competition is not based on proposals of the same phase or phases but
on the merit of the application independent of phase consideration. The evaluation criteria are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The application presents specific mitigation goals related to the proposed project. It explains how the tribe
or village intend to achieve those goals identified in the application and clearly documents the involvement and
support of the community in the planning process and implementation of the proposed project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above requirement can be met by the tribe or tribal organization through submission of a resolution that states
that community involvement has occurred in the project planning and will occur in the implementation of the proposed
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Available resources (other than ANA) which will assist and be coordinated with the project are described. These
resources may be personnel, facilities, vehicles or financial and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Organizational Capabilities and Qualifications (10 points): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The management and administrative structure of the applicant is explained. Evidence of the applicant's ability

of prior or current projects of similar scope by the organization and/or by the individuals designated to manage the
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position
descriptions and resumes relate specifically to the staff proposed in the Approach Page and in the proposed Budget
of the application. Position descriptions very clearly describe the position and its duties and clearly relate to
the personnel staffing required for implementation of the project activities. Either the position descriptions
or the resumes present the qualifications that the applicant believes are necessary for overall quality management
of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Project Objectives, Approach and Activities (45 points). The Objective Work Plan in the application includes
project objectives and activities related to the long term goals for each budget period proposed and demonstrates

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;are based on a fully described and locally determined balanced strategy for mitigation of impacts to the environment;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;clearly relate to the tribe or village long-range goals which the project addresses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;can be accomplished with available or expected resources during the proposed project period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;indicate when the objective, and major activities under each objective will be accomplished;

&bull;support a project that will be completed, self-sustaining, or financed by other than ANA funds at the end of
the project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Results or Benefits Expected (20 points). The proposed project will result in specific measurable outcomes for
each objective that will clearly contribute to the completion of the project and will help the tribe or village meet
its goals. The specific information provided in the application on expected results or benefits for each objective
is the basis upon which the outcomes can be evaluated at the end of each budget year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Budget (10 points). There is a detailed budget provided for each budget period requested. (This is especially
necessary for multi-year applications.) The budget is fully explained. It justifies each line item in the budget
categories in Section B of the Budget Information of the application, including the applicant's non-Federal share
and its source. Sufficient cost and other detail is included and explained to facilitate the determination of cost
allowability and the relevance of these costs to the proposed project. The funds requested are appropriate and necessary
for the scope of the project.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The following is provided to assist applicants to develop a competitive application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Program Guidance: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans will fund projects that present the strongest prospects for meeting
the stated purposes of this program announcement. Projects will not be funded on the basis of need alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In discussing the problems being addressed in the application, relevant historical data should be included
so that the appropriateness and potential benefits of the proposed project will be better understood by the reviewers
and decision-maker.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
&bull;Supporting documentation, if available, should be included to provide the reviewers and decision-maker
with other relevant data to better understand the scope and magnitude of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The applicant should provide documentation showing support for the proposed project from authorized officials,
board of directors and/or officers through a letter of support or resolution. It would be helpful, particularly for
organizations, to delineate the membership, make-up of the board of directors, and its elective procedures to assist
reviewers in determining authorized support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Technical Guidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants are strongly encouraged to have someone other than the author apply the evaluation criteria in
the program announcement and to score the application prior to its submission, in order to gain a better sense of its
quality and potential competitiveness in the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;ANA will accept only one application under this program announcement from any one applicant. If an eligible
applicant sends two applications, the one with the earlier postmark will be accepted for review unless the applicant
withdraws the earlier application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An application from an Indian tribe, Alaska Native Village or other eligible organization must be submitted
by the governing body of the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The application's Form 424 must be signed by the applicant's representative (tribal official or designate)
who can act with full authority on behalf of the applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administration for Native Americans suggests that the pages of the application be numbered sequentially
from the first page and that a table of contents be provided. The page numbering, along with simple tabbing of the sections,
would be helpful and allows easy reference during the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Two (2) copies of the application plus the original are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Cover Page should be the first page of an application, followed by the one-page abstract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section B of the Program Narrative should be of sufficient detail as to become a guide in determining and tracking
project goals and objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The applicant should specify the entire length of the project period on the first page of the Form 424, Block
13, not the length of the first budget period. ANA will consider the project period specified on the Form 424 as governing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Line 15a of the Form 424 should specify the Federal funds requested for the first Budget period, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
not the entire project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants proposing multi-year projects need to describe and submit project objective workplans and activities
for each budget period. (Separate itemized budgets for the Federal and non-Federal costs should be included) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Applicants for multi-year projects must justify the entire time-frame of the project and also project the
expected results to be achieved in each budget period and for the total project period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any exiting Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A,B,C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections, A,B,C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued E.O. 12862. Among the directives of the E.O. was the requirement that
agencies ``survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction
with existing services.'' As expressed in this E.O., customer satisfaction is seen as the ultimate performance indicator
for the Federal Government because it shows how well our customers are being served and what we must do to close the ``gap''
between what we provide our customers and what they want. Plans are to use a variety of voluntary ``survey instruments''
that will include both quantitative and qualitative written surveys, telephone exchanges, point-of-contact questionnaires,
focus groups, etc.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 29, 1994, IC Corp, ICRR, Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. (KCSI), and the Kansas City Southern Railway
Company (KCSR) (collectively applicants) filed a notice of intent to file an application seeking Commission approval
and authorization for: (1) IC Corp's acquisition of control of and merger with KCSI; and (2) the resulting common control
of ICRR and KCSR by IC Corp. Applicants have submitted a proposed voting trust agreement/management plan for which
they seek an informal opinion stating that the proposal effectively insulates IC Corp (the settlor of the trust) from
any violation of 49 U.S.C. 11343. The Commission here seeks comments on that issue and other related issues.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this transaction, IC Corp will acquire 100% of the stock of KCSI. The acquisition will occur as a part of a transaction
in which: (1) KCSI will effect a reorganization in which it distributes complete ownership of its financial services
and information processing operations to the holders of KCSI's common stock; and (2) IC Corp will place its stock in
its subsidiary, ICRR, rather than the carrier to be acquired (KCSR) or its parent (KCSI), into an independent voting
trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IC Corp proposes to acquire KCSI, which controls KCSR, without Commission authority. Section 11343 (49 U.S.C. 11343),
the provision governing consolidations, mergers, and acquisition of control, requires that Commission authority
be obtained for the acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers or the acquisition of control of at
least two carriers by a person that is not a carrier. After IC Corp places its shares of ICRR stock into trust, the holding
company will immediately acquire control of KCSR. Applicants state that, while awaiting approval of the transaction
by the Commission, ICRR and KCSR will be operated independently. The parties anticipate that the independent voting
trust will terminate upon approval of common control by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with the placement of ICRR stock into the voting trust, certain major personnel changes will be effected:
(1) IC Corp's and ICRR's current chairman of the board, president/Chief Executive Officer/director, and chief financial
officer will resign their positions with ICRR and assume identical positions at KCSR, but will retain their positions
with IC Corp; (2) their positions at ICRR will be filled, respectively, by ICRR's current senior vice president_marketing,
senior vice president_operations, and controller; (3) all ICRR officers who will remain with ICRR, and who presently
occupy positions with IC Corp, will resign from their positions with the holding company; and (4) several outside
directors will resign their positions on the IC Corp board and will become directors of ICRR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain shippers and labor interests have identified concerns associated with applicants' proposal. For this reason,
and because of the uniqueness of the proposal, we have decided to review it ourselves rather than delegating the matter
to agency staff. To assist us in that review, we seek public comment on: (1) whether the proposal sufficiently insulates
IC Corp from controlling ICRR prior to Commission approval of IC Corp's common control of KCSR and ICRR; (2) whether
certain conditions should be imposed on the trust arrangements; and (3) whether KCSR employees are entitled to labor
protection. Interested parties are also invited to comment on any other issues or concerns they deem relevant to the
voting trust/management plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We invite interested persons to submit written comments on applicants' proposal. Comments must be filed by November
15, 1994. Applicants may reply by November 25, 1994.

that may disclose: Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or
confidential; information of a personal nature the disclosure of which will constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from September 30, through
October 14, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on October 12, 1994 (59 FR 51616).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By November 25, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing

Description of amendments request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the Unit 2 Shutdown AC Sources Technical Specifications (TSs) to allow a one-time
extension from 7 to 14 days of the allowed outage time (AOT) for the dedicated Class 1E emergency power source during
the upcoming Unit 2 1995 Refueling Outage (RFO-10). The proposed amendments would also revise the Unit 1 Control Room
Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) TSs to provide a one-time extension from 7 to 30 days of the AOT for one train of
the CREVS to be inoperable. As noted, these extensions will be needed during the upcoming 1995 Unit 2 RFO-10 to support
the modifications scheduled for the onsite electrical distribution system in response to the Station Blackout (SBO)
Rule, 10 CFR 50.63, and the upgrade of No. 21 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific changes requested are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit 2 TSs 3.8.1.2 and 3.8.2.2 will include a footnote indicating that the AOT for aligning an operable emergency diesel
generator (EDG) to provide power to the emergency busses within 14 days during the Unit 2 RFO-10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit 1 TS 3.7.6.1 will be modified to indicate that during the No. 21 EDG upgrade, the time to restore the No. 21 filter
train of the air conditioning unit to operable status may be extended to 30 days (for loss of emergency power only) if:
1) A temporary diesel generator is demonstrated to be available by starting it at least once per 7 days and 2) if action
1 is not met, restore compliance with the action within 7 days or be at least in hot standby within the next 6 hours and
in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of issue of no significant hazards consideration
for each of the proposed changes, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In relation to the requested changes to the Unit 2 TSs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring one Class 1E Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) to be available for a shutdown unit ensures that AC power will
be available for a loss of offsite power event, a boron dilution event, or a fuel handling incident. There is a very low
probability that a loss of offsite power will occur due to severe weather or inadvertent damage to the switchyard during
the 14-day period that the temporary splice box is being installed and No. 12 EDG is out-of-service. The Calvert Cliffs
offsite power supply is highly redundant and has significant capability in withstanding severe weather events,
such as tornadoes. In addition, Calvert Cliffs Emergency Response Plan Implementation Procedures requires that
certain actions be taken, up to and including shutdown of both units, on the approach of a severe storm, such as a hurricane.
The probability of a loss of offsite power is maintained low by prohibiting planned maintenance on two of the three
500 kV transmission lines and associated relaying and devices within the switchyard. Availability of the required
offsite power sources will be verified once per shift. In addition to the offsite power sources, a temporary diesel
generator will also be installed to provide a backup onsite power source with the capacity to support the safety-related
loads of the shutdown unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The boron dilution event and the fuel handling incident are the only two accidents that are explicitly analyzed in
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report for a shutdown unit. The potential accident precursors such as core alterations,
positive reactivity insertions, movement of irradiated fuel and movement of heavy loads over irradiated fuel, will
be prohibited while No. 12 EDG is out-of-service for the temporary splice box installation. Therefore the probability
of a boron dilution event or fuel handling incident is decreased during the operations allowed by this change. The
requirement to maintain containment penetration closure ensures that the consequences of an accident would not
be significantly increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A temporary diesel generator is being installed onto a 4 kV bus of the shutdown unit while the dedicated EDG for this
unit is transferred to the operating unit for up to 14 days. This is an extension of the same configuration allowed by
Action Statements 3.8.1.2.b and 3.8.2.2.b with additional provision taken for the Control Room Emergency Ventilation
System (CREVS). The EDGs will be aligned so that each train of the CREVS will have an emergency power supply available.
The proposed change has been evaluated and it has been determined that it does not impair any existing safety-related
equipment needed to maintain the unit in a safe shutdown condition, and does not create any new accident initiators.
The operation of the temporary diesel generator is familiar to the operators and is not significantly different from
typical operator activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function provided by the AC electrical power sources and associated distribution systems for a shutdown
unit is to ensure that the unit can be maintained in a safe shutdown condition, and there is sufficient instrumentation
and control capability available for monitoring and maintaining the unit status. The proposed change would allow
the shutdown unit to be without a dedicated Class 1E emergency power source for up to 14 days. This is an extension of
the outage time of seven days allowed by the Technical Specifications for performing maintenance and inspections
on No. 12 EDG. This proposed change will have no impact on the offsite power sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several compensatory measures will be taken during this period to ensure that a power source will be available for
the shutdown unit. These measures include requiring that two offsite power sources are available, and a temporary
diesel generator will be installed capable of supplying the loads necessary to maintain the unit in a safe condition.
In addition, Technical Specifications require several compensatory measures to reduce the potential for a fuel
handling incident and a boron dilution event. These measures include prohibiting positive reactivity changes,
suspending core alterations, movement of irradiated fuel, and the movement of heavy loads over irradiated fuel.
Establishing containment penetration closure further ensures that adequate margin of safety is maintained. In
addition, reduced inventory conditions of the Reactor Coolant System will be prohibited during the 14-day period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In relation to the requested changes in the Unit 1 TSs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) is designed so that the Control Room can be occupied under all
plant conditions. The CREVS is required to maintain the Control Room temperature and to filter the Control Room air
in the event of a radioactive release. When No. 21 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) is being upgraded, No. 12 CREVS
will be without a Class 1E emergency power source. The CREVS is not an initiator in any previously evaluated accidents.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CREVS is required to maintain the Control Room habitable following a radioactive release from a loss of coolant
accident, a main steam break, or a steam generator tube rupture. There is a very low probability of an event occurring
requiring Control Room isolation during the 30-day period that it will take to upgrade No. 21 EDG. Requiring that the
CREVS have both a normal power source and an emergency power source available ensures that one train of the system will
be available so that the Control Room can be occupied under these conditions. The probability of a loss of offsite power
is very low due to the highly redundant design of the offsite power supply. Planned maintenance on three of the offsite
power supplies and associated relaying and devices within the switchyard will be prohibited during the upgrade period
to maintain the low probability of a loss of offsite power event. Number 12 CREVS train will continue to have its normal
power source for all but approximately four days when the bus will be de-energized to allow bus work that is necessary
to the tie-in of the Alternate AC diesel generator. Number 11 CREVS will have both its normal and emergency power supply
available and this train is capable of maintaining the Control Room habitable. In addition, a temporary diesel generator
will be installed to provide assurance that an emergency power source will be available to No. 12 CREVS. The compensatory
measures that will be taken during this period will ensure that the proposed change does not involve a significant
increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CREVS is not being modified by this proposed change. The system will continue to operate in the same manner. Number
21 EDG will operate in a similar manner after the upgrade and will be able to support unit operation after all the testing
is completed. The installation of the temporary diesel generator during the upgrade period has been evaluated to
ensure that it does not create any new accident initiators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operability of the CREVS during Modes 1 through 4 ensures that the Control Room will remain habitable under all
plant conditions. The proposed change does not affect the function of the CREVS. The proposed change will allow one
train of the CREVS to be without a Class 1E emergency power supply for up to 30 days. This train will have the normal power
supply available for all but approximately four days to allow necessary bus work. The other train of the CREVS will
have both its normal and emergency power supplies during this period. Compensatory measures that will be taken include
prohibiting planned maintenance on the required offsite power sources and installing a temporary diesel generator
of sufficient capacity as a backup to the affected train. These measures will maintain the current margin of safety.
The upgrade to the existing EDGs will provide additional margin for the electrical loading of 4 kV safety-related
busses. The completion of the No. 21 EDG upgrade will improve the margin of safety for the onsite electrical distribution
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment changes the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station Technical Specifications Sections 3.7.B.1.a,
3.7.B.1.c, 3.7.B.1.e, 3.7.B.2.a, and 3.7.B.2.c. The proposed changes also add new sections 3.7.B.1.f and 3.7.B.2.e.
These sections require both trains of the Standby Gas Treatment (SGTS) and Control Room High Efficiency Air Filtration
(CRHEAF) System to be operable for the initiation of fuel movement and during fuel handling operations involving
irradiated fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications 3.7.B.1 and 3.7.B.2.e restrict the movement of irradiated fuel when only one train of SGTS
or one train of CRHEAF are operable. Irradiated fuel movement may not begin and may only continue for seven days when
the Limiting Condition of Operation is entered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing these restrictions during refueling operations does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because compensatory measures will be in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When sections 3.7.B.1.f and 3.7.B.2.e are invoked fuel movement will not commence until 5 days following plant shutdown
and reactor vessel will be flooded-up to elevation 114''. The 5 day period provides decay-time before irradiated
fuel movement begins. Flooding-up elevation 114'' provides an enlarged inventory reducing the possibility of a
loss-of-coolant event exposing fuel such that radioactive gasses are produced, an event SGTS and CRHEAF are designed
to mitigate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other compensatory measures include requiring the SBO [station blackout] diesel or the shutdown transformer to
be operable prior to and during the fuel movement. This adds defense-in-depth by making available another power supply
to the in-service safety-related bus. Also, the substitution of a non-safety power supply to the SGTS and CRHEAF ``inoperable''
systems while their safety-grade bus is out-of-service for maintenance will provide offsite power to the ``inoperable''
train. While this electrical supply is not safety-grade, it is reliable and capable of powering the SGTS and CRHEAF
systems. The components of the ``inoperable'' trains will be available with power from an alternate power source.
The compensatory connection to the non-safety grade bus gives added confidence these trains can perform the design
function although they are not ``operable'' as defined by Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequence of an accident previously analyzed because compensatory measures will be in force to: restrict the
commencement of irradiated fuel handling or new fuel handling over the spent fuel or core until 5 days following reactor
shutdown; provide a reliable source of power to the ``inoperable'' SGTS and CRHEAF systems; provide an enlarged coolant
inventory to protect irradiated fuel from the effects of an inadvertent draindown of the vessel; and provide an additional
source of emergency power to the active SGTS and CRHEAF systems by ensuring the operability of the SBO diesel generator
or the Shutdown Transformer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planned maintenance activities require removing a safety-related bus and emergency diesel generator powering
a train of SGTS and CRHEAF from service. The redundant trains are not affected. The affected trains of SGTS and CRHEAF
will be connected to a non-safety bus, allowing them to operate but not allowing them to be considered operable under
the purview of Technical Specifications. The proposed change allows refueling activities to commence with one train
of SGTS and CRHEAF fully operable and the other train available but not powered by its safety grade bus and associated
emergency diesel generator. Compensatory measures will be in effect during refueling activities involving this
configuration. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from the fuel-drop
accident previously analyzed. Therefore, operating Pilgrim in accordance with this change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SGTS and CRHEAF contribute to the margin of safety during fuel handling by mitigating the consequences of a fuel-handling
event. Allowing an exception to the requirement of both trains of SGTS and CRHEAF operable prior to or during fuel movement
activities does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because the first line of defense, the
other SGTS and CRHEAF trains, will be operable. The redundant trains will also be powered and operable in all ways except
the ``operable'' concept required by Technical Specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, the actual condition of the equipment allows it to meet its design function except under the strict Technical
Specification interpretation of operable, and the described compensatory measures that will be in effect when the
exception is employed, constrain the potential impact on the margin of safety caused by using the exception; therefore,
operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed Technical Specification request does not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed amendment would reduce the Reactor Pressure Setpoint at which the shutdown cooling system automatically
isolates. This setpoint also isolates the low pressure coolant injection valves when the shutdown cooling system
is in operation.

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification Table 3.2.A lists the instrumentation that initiates primary containment isolation and
also lists the trip level setting (setpoints) for that instrumentation. The setpoint for reactor high pressure is
presently [less than or equal to] 110 psig which was selected to provide protection for the RHR [residual heat removal]
low pressure suction piping against possible overpressurization. This signal initiates a group 3 containment isolation
by closing the shutdown cooling isolation valves and the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) valves. To provide
an optimal solution to address Generic Letter 89-10, the motor-operated valves which effect the isolation of the
RHR suction piping (MO1001-47 and MO1001-50) are being modified based on a lower differential pressure in the design
calculations. The setpoint is being reduced to ensure plant operation is maintained in accordance with the new design
and to continue to provide the protection necessary against overpressurization. This does not involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed because reducing the setpoint to less than
what the technical specifications currently requires is a change in the conservative direction relative to protection
of the piping. The LPCI injection valves are designed for higher pressures and the proposed setpoint change does not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specification Table 3.2.B lists instrumentation that initiates or controls the core and containment
cooling systems and also lists the trip level settings (setpoints) for that instrumentation. The setpoint for reactor
low pressure [less than or equal to] 110 psig, is a permissive for the group 3 isolation of the RHR inboard injection
valves. Reducing the setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig is consistent with the design of the other group 3 isolation
valves that receive the same signal and accomplishes the isolation of the shutdown cooling system when there is a system
breach. Thus, revising this setpoint does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed setpoint change supports modifications made to the shutdown cooling isolation valves to provide additional
margin to address Generic Letter 89-10 concerns. Reducing the setpoint for this function continues to provide protection
of the RHR suction piping and ensures closure of the isolation valves. Therefore, revising the reactor high pressure
setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig for instrumentation that initiates primary containment isolation (Table
3.2.A) does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated. Similarly, the
revision of the reactor low pressure setpoint to [less than or equal to] 76 psig for instrumentation that initiates
or controls the core and containment cooling systems does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the setpoint for reactor pressure in Table 3.2.A and 3.2.B is to provide protection for the RHR suction
piping and ensure proper isolation for unlikely piping breaches. Changing the setpoint to a lower value is consistent
with modifications being made to the shutdown cooling isolation valves. The margin of safety for this setpoint was
established to protect the RHR suction piping from overpressurization and to ensure that primary containment integrity
could be established by the isolation valves on a Group 3 isolation. A margin of safety for protecting the RHR suction
piping exists due to the difference between the design pressure of the piping and the setpoint specified in the technical
specifications. Reducing the setpoint increases the difference between the design pressure of the piping and the
setpoint hence, this margin of safety is increased. The margin of safety established for primary containment isolation
valves is maintained by specifying a setpoint which corresponds to the closing differential pressure of the valves
under postulated accident conditions. The setpoint change does not reduce the design margins established to ensure
the valves perform their design isolation function when required. The low pressure coolant injection valves that
receive this same signal are designed for higher pressures than the current setpoint of [less than or equal to] 110
psig and, therefore, a lower setpoint increases the margin of safety. Thus, the proposed amendment does not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would remove Technical Specification section 4.5.H.4, a section which requires the testing

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. [***].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discharge piping for ECC systems is maintained filled to prevent water hammer during automatic pump starts. Monthly
venting is the primary means of ensuring filled discharge piping. The pressure switches are an adjunct to such venting.
Hence, piping in the Core Spray System, the Low Pressure Coolant Injection System (LPCI), the High Pressure Coolant
Injection (HPCI) system, and the Reactor Core Isolation Coolant (RCIC) system are all equipped with pressure switches
that detect pressure decay in the discharge piping of these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change does not change Pilgrim's configuration or equipment. The switches perform a surveillance
function and do not provide a signal needed to prevent or mitigate an accident. The switches will continue to perform
their surveillance function and their surveillance and calibration will be performed in accordance with Pilgrim
procedures. Removal of section 4.5.H.4 eliminates the possibility of inoperable switches forcing the shutdown
of Pilgrim or the alternative of declaring an operable safety system inoperable because of its association with these
switches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Specifications will continue to require venting the discharge piping high point when the systems are configured
such that water hammer can occur. (sections 4.5.H.1, 4.5.H.2 and 4.5.H.3). Thus, the application of this proposed
change does not reduce the Technical Specifications intent of reducing the likelihood of discharge piping water
hammer. Therefore, operating Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.5.H's purpose is to maintain the ECCS discharge piping filled to prevent water hammer. The purpose of the
pressure switches is to detect voids in ECCS discharge piping to prevent the possibility of damage due to water hammer.
These switches are not safety-related, have no automatic functions, and are not relied on to prevent or mitigate an
accident. Instead, they enhance the existing discharge pipe venting surveillance requirements by detecting void
formation in discharge pipe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The switches will continue to perform their surveillance function through Pilgrim procedures. Venting will continue
to be required by Technical Specifications. Therefore, operating Pilgrim in accordance with this proposed change
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because
the proposed change does not impair the detection of conditions necessary to produce a water hammer in the discharge
piping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discharge piping pressure switches are surveillance instruments and act as a secondary means of protecting the
discharge piping from conditions that can produce water hammer. They are not relied on to prevent or mitigate accidents.
Hence, these switches do not significantly impact safety because they are not the primary means of preventing discharge
piping water hammer. Therefore, removing the pressure switches from Technical Specifications potentially contributes
to plant availability but does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the primary method
of detection (venting) remains and the switches will continue to be subject to procedural controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change has been reviewed and recommended for approval by the Operations Review Committee and reviewed
by the Nuclear Safety Review and Audit Committee.

A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Section 6 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors
and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of
an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and provide clarification. These changes provide consistency
with station procedures, programs, the Code of Federal Regulations, other Technical Specifications, and Standard

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. The
proposed changes are considered to be administrative changes. All responsibilities described in Technical Specifications
for management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals.

C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. The initial conditions and
methodologies used in the accident analyses remain unchanged, therefore, accident analysis results are not impacted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are administrative in nature and have no impact on the margin of safety of any Technical Specification.
They do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. The descriptions for the Shift Technical Advisor and

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change involves replacement of concentrated NaOH injected via the containment spray system
with trisodium phosphate (TSP) stored in the containment and dissolved in the sump recirculation solution to maintain
acceptable post accident spray/recirculation solution chemistry. Deletion of the concentrated NaOH will eliminate
a personnel hazard. The pH control system functions in response to an accident and does not involve or have any effect
on any initiating event for any accident previously evaluated. Operation under the proposed amendment will continue
to ensure that iodine potentially released post-LOCA is retained in the sump solution, and resultant offsite and
control room thyroid doses are within the limits of 10 CFR 100 and 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General Design Criterion 19,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The deleted equipment is isolated from the remaining equipment by blind flanges, locked closed valves,
cut and capped piping, determinated and/or spared cables; and interfaces are analyzed to ensure the remaining required
equipment meets applicable original design requirements. The new equipment (TSP and baskets) is a passive pH control
system and is supported and analyzed to ensure there are no adverse interfaces (e.g. pipe break, jet impingement,
seismic) with existing equipment, systems, or structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The slight change in recirculation
solution pH maintains adequate protection against chloride induced stress corrosion cracking of austenitic stainless
steel and maintains the capability of the solution to retain iodine. It results in an insignificant increase in the
post-accident rate of hydrogen generation, which remains well within the existing capacity of the hydrogen recombiners.
The increased mass in the containment will have no significant impact on post-accident flood levels, recirculation
solution boron concentration, or peak clad temperatures. No other operating parameters for systems, structures,
or components assumed to operate in the safety analysis are changed. The offsite and control room doses meet the limits
of 10 CFR 100 and GDC 19 respectively. Because the trisodium phosphate is nonvolatile and the baskets are protected
with solid covers and are located slightly above the floor in the containment where access is strictly controlled,
a surveillance interval of once per refueling outage provides assurance that the TSP will be available when required.

1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed revision to the
Facility Operating License does not affect the safety analysis and does not involve any physical changes to the plant,
nor any changes in the format or restraints on plant operations, and only contemplates a change to the Plan for the Long
Range Planning Program currently approved by the NRC in license condition 2.C.(9). Therefore, this change will not
increase the probability of previously analyzed accidents because it involves no direct plant modification or change
in operation, and hence, it is also unrelated to the possibility of increasing the consequences of previously analyzed
accidents.

The proposed amendment would revise the Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Technical Specifications, Section 3.5.C ``HPCI
System,'' to increase the minimum pressure at which the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System is required

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the reactor vessel pressure at which the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System must be operable
from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
113 psig to 150 psig will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The HPCI System is designed to provide adequate reactor vessel coolant injection for small break accidents
where the reactor vessel remains pressurized. Therefore, the HPCI System provides a means of responding to previously
analyzed accidents. Changing the lower bound reactor vessel pressure limit at which the HPCI System must be operable
does not affect any of the accident initiation sequences previously analyzed, and therefore this proposed change
will not result in an increase in the probability of any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the required pressure at which the HPCI System must be operable from 113 psig to 150 psig will not involve
a significant increase in the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. Increasing this minimum pressure
at which the HPCI System must be OPERABLE will not affect the availability of other systems which provide standby core
cooling. The CNS Core Standby Cooling Systems (CSCS), which consist of the HPCI System, the Automatic Depressurization
System (ADS), the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) System, and the Core Spray (CS) System, are designed to cover
the spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents. For large break events, the reactor vessel will depressurize below the
point where the HPCI System is OPERABLE, and single failure proof core cooling is provided by a combination of the LPCI
and CS systems. For small break events wherein the reactor vessel does not rapidly depressurize, the HPCI System is
designed to provide core cooling with a reactor vessel pressure range of 1120 psig to 150 psig. Upon failure of the HPCI
System to provide adequate core cooling, the ADS in conjunction with the LPCI and CS systems provide single failure
proof assurance of adequate core cooling. The Low Pressure Systems (LPCI and CS) are designed and required to provide
core cooling at reactor pressures below 150 psig.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District performed calculations which have determined that the low pressure Core Standby Cooling systems are
capable of providing adequate core cooling with a reactor pressure of 150 psig under the most degraded pump conditions,
i.e., pump performance at minimum Technical Specifications requirements. Additionally, the District reviewed
applicable engineering calculations to ensure that no calculations were relying on the HPCI System to provide degraded
flow to the reactor vessel during any accident scenario or transient. Based on the diverse means of providing adequate
core cooling for the spectrum of loss-of-coolant accidents, and the capability of the low pressure core cooling systems
to provide adequate core cooling at 150 psig and below, changing the required pressure at which HPCI must be operable
from 113 psig to 150 psig will not change the capability to provide adequate core cooling following postulated events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR)
accident analyses. Since the USAR accident analyses remain bounding, the radiological consequences previously
evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes. Therefore, it can be concluded
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2.Does the proposed License Amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes introduce no new failure modes for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any
new limiting failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Increasing the minimum reactor pressure
at which the HPCI System is required to be OPERABLE will not cause an unplanned initiation of the HPCI System or any other
plant system or equipment, nor will the change impede the initiation of any required safety system. The HPCI System
relies on the containment suppression pool, emergency condensate storage tanks, plant D.C. electrical system,
and the reactor low water level and high drywell pressure instrumentation to adequately operate. The proposed increase
in the minimum reactor pressure at which the HPCI System would be required OPERABLE will not affect the equipment of
these systems, nor will the change affect the physical configuration of the HPCI System. There will be no change in
the types or increase in the amount of effluents released offsite. Therefore, the proposed change does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Does the proposed change create a significant reduction in the margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the reactor vessel pressure at which the HPCI System must be OPERABLE from 113 psig to 150 psig will not constitute
a significant reduction in the margin of safety. As stated in the Technical Specifications Bases Section 3.5.C, the
HPCI System is designed to provide rated cooling water flow for reactor pressures ranging from 1120 psig to 150 psig.
The HPCI is not designed to provide rated cooling water flow at reactor pressures below 150 psig. At reactor operating
pressures below 150 psig, the low pressure core cooling systems are required to be available, are capable of fulfilling
their functions, and provide the required flow in the low pressure regions below 150 psig. Additionally, the combination
of the ADS, LPCI and CS systems provide additional means of providing adequate core cooling at any reactor pressure.
Therefore the proposed change to increase the minimum reactor pressure at which the HPCI System is required to be operable
to greater than 150 psig will not significantly reduce the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concludes that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the operation of the APR [automatic pressure relief] or FWCI [feedwater coolant
injection] subsystems, nor the SBGT [standby gas treatment] system. The proposed changes do not modify the required
actions described in the LCOs [limiting conditions for operation] when either one or both circuits of SBGT or an APR
valve are determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes will increase the availability of the APR subsystem by
eliminating a surveillance requirement that causes the actuation logic to be taken out of service for testing when
one valve is determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes will not affect the availability of the remaining circuit
of SBGT since testing does not remove the train from service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the SBGT and APR systems function to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents. As such, modification
to the surveillance requirements does not create a significant increase in the probability of an accident. Eliminating
the alternate train testing requirement will not significantly increase the consequences of a postulated accident.
The added assurance that the APR actuation logic is operable which is provided by Section 4.5.D.2 is not sufficient
to justify the loss of safety function during testing, or the increased risk of inadvertent operation of the APR valves
or the FWCI subsystem. While Technical Specification 4.7.B.3.c does not remove the remaining SBGT circuit from service,
reasonable assurance of operability is provided by Technical Specification 4.7.B.2.d which requires a monthly
demonstration of operability of each train of the SBGT system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed would
occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes delete the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining APR valves actuation
logic, the FWCI subsystem, and the alternate circuit of SBGT immediately and daily thereafter when one APR valve or
one circuit of SBGT is determined to be inoperable. The proposed changes do not add or change any equipment or logic.
The proposed changes also do not alter any system operability requirements. These changes only affect the number
of surveillance tests which must be performed. They do not affect the test methodology for any of these systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there are no changes to the function, operation, or surveillance test methodology of any of these systems, the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes delete the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining APR valves actuation
logic, the FWCI subsystem, and the alternate circuit of SBGT immediately and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily thereafter when one APR valve or one circuit of SBGT is determined to be inoperable. The elimination of the additional
assurance that the actuation logic for the remaining APR valves and the FWCI subsystem is operable is more than offset
by the increase in the margin of safety which is created by eliminating a requirement to remove the safety system from
service for testing. The margin of safety for the SBGT system is not significantly reduced since this system is tested
monthly in accordance with Technical Specification 4.7.B.2.d.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assurance of operability is provided by the normal, scheduled surveillances which have been established at a sufficient
interval to provide reasonable assurance of operability. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant
reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment requests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) for the Diablo Canyon Power Plant
Unit Nos. 1 and 2 to revise surveillance requirements (SRs) as recommended by NRC Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item
Technical Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.''
The specific TS changes proposed are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) TS SR 4.1.3.1.2 would be revised to change the frequency for testing the movability of the control rods from at least
once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) TS 3/4.3.2, Table 4.3-2, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,''
Functional Unit 3.c.4), and TS 3/4.3.3.1, Table 4.3-3, ``Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation for Plant Operations
SRs,'' would be revised to change the monthly channel functional test to a quarterly channel functional test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes to TS 3/4.5.1 are as follows: (a)TS SR 4.5.1.1a.1) would be revised to more clearly state that
the accumulator water volume and pressure must be verified to be within their limits. (b) TS SR 4.5.1.1b. would be revised
to specify that the boron concentration surveillance is not required to be performed if the accumulator makeup source
was the refueling water storage tank (RWST). (c) TS SR 4.5.1.2 would be relocated to plant procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) TS SR 4.5.2c.2) would be revised to clarify that a separate containment entry to verify the absence of loose debris
is not required after each containment entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) TS SR 4.6.2.1d. would be revised to change the frequency for a containment spray header flow test from at least once
per 5 years to at least once per 10 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) TS SR 4.6.4.2a. would be revised to change the verification of the minimum hydrogen recombiner sheath temperature
from at least once per 6 months to at least once each refueling interval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) TS SR 4.7.1.2.1 would be revised to change the surveillance frequency for testing each auxiliary feedwater (AFW)
pump from at least once per 31 days to at least once per 92 days on a staggered test basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) TS SR 4.10.1.2 would be revised to lengthen the allowed period of time for a rod drop test from 24 hours to 7 days prior
to reducing shutdown margin to less than the limits of TS 3.1.1.1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) TS SR 4.11.2.6 would be revised to change the surveillance frequency from 24 hours to 7 days when radioactive material
is being added to the gas decay tanks and to add a requirement to monitor radioactive material concentrations in the
gas decay tanks at least once per 24 hours when system degassing operations are in progress.

The changes proposed in this LAR [license amendment request] are consistent with the guidance provided in GL 93-05.

The proposed changes do not affect the method of operating any equipment at DCPP. Additionally, the proposed changes
do not result in a physical modification to any plant equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes affect the surveillance requirements. There is no decrease in equipment reliability by the

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed license amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.4, ``Snubbers,'' and its bases,
in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 90-09, ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection Intervals
and Corrective Actions.'' One difference from GL 90-09 is that the initial inspection interval using the new criteria
would be 18 months from the conclusion of the visual inspection conducted during the recently completed refueling
outage. Additional changes to the TS would be made to ensure consistency with the revised snubber visual inspection
interval schedule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change has been reviewed for PNPP and has been determined not to involve a significant hazards consideration
based on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the guidance recommended in a GL 90-09 will not introduce any new failure mode and will not alter any assumptions
previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. As stated in the GL, the proposed alternate schedule
for visual inspections of snubbers will maintain the same operability confidence level as the existing schedule.
Also, the surveillance requirements and schedule for snubbers functional testing remains the same, providing a
95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified acceptance
limits. The proposed visual inspection schedule is separate from the functional testing and provides additional
confidence that the installed snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable. The proposed
change does not affect limiting safety system settings or operating parameters, and does not modify or add any accident
initiating events or parameters. No hardware modifications are associated with these changes. Therefore, the proposed
change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the recommendations provided in GL 90-09 does not involve any physical alterations to plant equipment,
changes to setpoints or operating parameters, nor does it involve any accident initiating event. As stated in the
GL, the alternate schedule for snubber visual inspections maintains the same confidence level as the existing schedule.
In addition to the visual inspections, functional testing of snubbers, which provides a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within specified acceptance limits, will continue to be performed.
Since this TS change does not physically alter the plant equipment and the snubber confidence level remains the same
there will not be any new or different accident resulting from snubber failure from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change incorporates surveillance requirements for snubber visual inspection intervals that are consistent
with the guidance provided in GL 90-09. As stated in the GL, the proposed snubber visual inspection interval maintains
the same confidence level as the existing snubber visual inspection interval. This surveillance requirement does
not alter the current Limiting Condition for Operation or the accompanying actions for the snubber(s). The requirement
for functional testing of safety-related snubbers is unchanged and remains the basis for the established margin
of safety and assures a 95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the
specified acceptance limits. The functional testing along with the proposed visual inspection provides adequate
assurance that the snubber will perform its intended function. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a
significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.91(a), Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Licensee) has evaluated
the proposed changes against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the operation of Point Beach Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendments, does not present a significant hazards consideration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed facility operating license amendment does not present a significant hazards consideration if operation
of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
CRITERION 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to the allowed out of
service times have no impact on the probability of an accident occurring. This equipment being out of service is not
an initiator for any accident previously evaluated. There is no physical change to the facility, its systems or its
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarification of service water pump operability requirements will ensure redundant train capability to mitigate
the consequences of an accident which has been previously evaluated. Extending the allowed out of service times for
the safety injection, residual heat removal, and containment spray pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat
exchangers does not create a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed
changes are consistent with the Westinghouse Improved Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG 1431, Revision
0. Plant specific analysis demonstrates the proposed changes do not pose an undue risk and thus will not result in a
significant increase in the consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRITERION 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The safety injection, containment spray,
and residual heat removal pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat exchangers are used to mitigate the consequences
of an accident and are not normally in use during power operation. The availability of these components does not effect
the possibility of a new or different type of accident. The service water pumps are normally in use during power operation.
The proposed change will ensure that redundant train capability exists. Minimum service water pump requirements
remain the same. The failure modes of the service water system remain unchanged. Therefore, extending the allowed
out of service time does not create the possibility of a different type of accident than previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRITERION 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The proposed Technical Specification changes revise the allowed outage times for the safety
injection, residual heat removal, and containment spray pumps and valves and residual heat removal heat exchangers
to 72 hours. This change will allow more time for corrective maintenance to be performed on these components, if required,
and avoid potential transients and challenges to safety systems associated with a required shutdown of the unit without
the specific safety related equipment operable. The proposed changes are consistent with the Westinghouse Improved
Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG 1431, Revision 0. Plant specific analysis demonstrates the changes do
not pose an undue risk and thus will not result in a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The clarification to
the specification for service water pump operability may increase the margin of safety by ensuring that redundant
train capability exists.

This amendment would revise Technical Specification 3/4.3.3, Table 4.3-3, ``Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation
For Plant Operations Surveillance,'' to change the analog channel operational test (ACOT) interval from monthly
to quarterly for the following radiation monitors: (1) Containment Atmosphere - Gaseous Radioactivity - High (GT-RE-31

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability of Consequences of an Accident Previously Evaluated
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Review of past ACOT history for
the affected monitors revealed that these monitors have experienced no calibration or setpoint-related problems
since the beginning of plant operation. Increasing the ACOT frequency for these monitors will not adversely affect
system operability, and this change would reduce the potential for instrument damage, thus effectively increasing
system reliability and availability. These radiation monitors are not accident-initiating equipment, so increasing
the surveillance interval on these monitors will not affect the probability of any accident previously evaluated.
In addition, for the monitors listed in TS Table 4.3-3, no credit is taken in the plant accident analyses in Chapter
15 of the USAR for any automatic actuation function generated as a result of a radiation monitor signal. On these bases
it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new type of accident or malfunction will be created since the radiation monitors are not accident-initiating equipment.
The proposed change merely increases the ACOT interval for the affected radiation monitors, and does not change the
method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect applicable safety
analysis acceptance criteria and will not affect system operating conditions. In addition, plant operating experience
has shown that these monitors have not experienced calibration of setpoint-related failures since the beginning
of plant operation. Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical
specification, is not reduced.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter of August 13, 1993, and as supplemented on September 15, 1993, September 16, 1993, December 17, 1993, January
19, 1994, February 11, 1994, and February 24, 1994, Commonwealth Edison Company submitted requests for amendments
for steam generator (SG) tube sleeving in accordance with (1) Westinghouse and (2) Babcock &amp; Wilcox processes.
By letter dated March 4, 1994, the NRC granted the proposed sleeving methods contingent upon four conditions which
the licensee accepted in their letter of February 24, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four changes will be reflected in the plants' Technical Specifications (TS). By letter dated June 3, 1994,
the licensee requested changes to TS 3.4.5 and 3.4.6.2 to include the three conditions, which are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect a primary-to-secondary leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per
day (gpd) through any one SG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Amend the Byron and Braidwood licenses to reflect an inservice inspection of a minimum of 20 percent of a random sample
of the sleeves for axial and circumferential indication at the end-of-cycle. In the event that an imperfection of
40 percent or greater depth is detected, an additional 20 percent (minimum) of the unsampled sleeves should be inspected,
and if an imperfection of 40 percent or greater depth is detected in the second sample, all remaining sleeves should
be inspected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Add a condition to the Byron and Braidwood licenses to conduct additional corrosion testing to establish the design
life for the kinetically or laser welded sleeved tubes in the presence of a crevice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collectively, these conditions will enable the licensee to have:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Further assurance that the integrity of the SGs will be maintained in the event of a main steam line break or under
loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) conditions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Increased monitoring of the SG tube sleeves for any degradation; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Increased confidence that SG sleeve integrity will be maintained for extended operations.

Brief description of amendment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Section 4.4 of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 Power Plant Technical
Specifications. Specifically, TS 4.4.E.1 would be revised to allow a one-time extension to the 30-month interval
requirement for leak rate testing of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870. A one-time schedular exemption from plant specific requirements associated with
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Type C testing (local leak rate test) for the above listed RHR containment isolation valves
will be processed separately. This one-time extension for leak rate testing of the RHR valves would defer the leak
rate testing until the next refueling outage, when the RHR system can be removed from service as required by current
procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises Technical Specification Sections 3.1 and 4.1 for Protective Instrumentation, the associated
bases, and tables to increase the surveillance test intervals and add allowable out-of service times. The Technical
Specification changes will permit specified Channel Tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly.
The amendment will enhance operational safety by reducing (1) the potential for inadvertent plant scrams, (2) excessive
test cycles or equipment, and (3) the diversion of plant personnel and resources on unnecessary testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional technical changes have been incorporated. The fist change involves extending the Channel Calibration
interval for Average Power Range Monitor. The second change would add a quarterly Channel Calibration requirement
for High Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) and Turbine Trip Scram Instrumentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Editorial changes have been incorporated in Instrumentation Sections 3.1 and 4.1 to provide clarity and consistency.

SI-1833A and B and add valves SI-MOV-1835A and B. The valves being deleted no longer perform a containment isolation
function as a result of a modification which removed the boron injection tank. The valves being added are needed for
testing the safety injection pumps.

The amendment revises the fuel oil availability requirements for the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) from Section
3.7 of the Technical Specifications (TSs). This TS change requires that 30,026 gallons of fuel oil be available onsite
in addition to the oil in the EDG storage tanks. Specification 3.7.F.4 is also being changed to require a total of 7056
gallons of fuel in the EDG fuel oil storage tanks. In addition, administrative changes will remove the word ``available''
from the phrase ''... gallons of fuel available...'' in Section 3.7.A.5 (for the individual storage tanks) to avoid
confusion regarding the amount of usable fuel in the tanks.

The amendment revises Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the Technical Specifications (TSs). The TS Section 3.4 revision reduces
the maximum allowable percent of rated power associated with inoperable Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs). This change
modifies Table 3.4-1 and the associated basis such that the maximum power level allowed for operation with inoperable
MSSVs is below the heat removing capability of the operable MSSVs. The TS Section 3.5 revision corrects administrative
errors in the action statements associated with Items 2.a and 2.c of Table 3.5-4. Additionally, the changes to Item
2.b of Table 3.5-3 and Item 2.b of Table 3.5-4 clarify the action statements associated with inoperable high containment
pressure (Hi-Hi Level) instrumentation.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the TS Surveillance Requirement 4.8.1.1.2 to allow ``slow starts'' of the emergency diesel
generator (EDG) instead of ``fast starts'' during the monthly surveillance. A ``fast start'' is still required to
be performed at least once every 184 days. These changes are expected to improve EDG availability and reliability.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By November
25, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

(Project Director)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

Brief description of amendment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) 4.8.2.1.e, ``DC Sources - Operating'' to specify
that the provisions of TS 4.0.1 and 4.0.4 are not applicable to the battery capacity requirements until entry into
Mode 4 coming out of the fifth refueling outage or upon any deep discharge cycle of the battery. The amendment was requested
on an emergency basis so that the licensee could declare the Unit 2 batteries operable based upon the current capacities
of the batteries without having to satisfy the surveillance requirement of TS 4.8.2.1.e. The licensee will thus be
able to change modes and start up from the current mid-cycle steam generator inspection outage.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power &amp; Light Company et al. Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2; Issuance of Director's Decision
Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), has issued a Director's Decision
concerning a Petition dated October 14, 1993, filed pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206, on behalf of the National Whistleblower
Center (NWC), the Coastal Alliance for a Safe Environment (CASE), and Mr. Charles A. Webb, requesting that actions
be taken regarding the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (Brunswick), Units 1 and 2, of the Carolina Power &amp; Light
Company (CP&amp;L or the Licensee). The Petition requested that (1) the NRC staff enter into a confidentiality agreement
with NWC to facilitate the release of additional information; (2) the NRC immediately require the Licensee to state
whether it has, in fact, known about cracks in the reactor core shroud since at least 1984; and (3) the Commission's
Office of Investigations determine whether CP&amp;L management engaged in criminal wrongdoing, commencing in
1984, when CP&amp;L is alleged to have failed to report the existence of cracks in the core shroud to the NRC. The Petition
also requested an immediate suspension of the operating license for Brunswick pending the criminal investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioners based their request on allegations that (1) the Licensee falsely asserted to the NRC and to the public
that cracks in the reactor shroud were but recently discovered, and the Petitioners contend that the Licensee discovered
the cracks nine years earlier and the Licensee's management instructed the engineers who detected the cracks to prepare
paperwork that would ensure that the cracks would not be reported to the NRC; (2) this alleged coverup demonstrates
that CP&amp;L does not have the character or integrity to operate a nuclear facility because of its unwillingness
to report significant safety problems to the NRC; and (3) the Licensee is willing to take unreasonable risks with the
health and safety of the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of NRR has granted in part and denied in part the Petitioner's requests. The reasons are explained in the
``Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;09), which is available for public inspection and
copying in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037, and at the Licensee's
local public document room at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601
S. College Road, Wilmington, NC 28403&hyph;3297. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the Decision will be filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance
with 10 CFR 2.206(c). As provided for in 10 CFR 2.206(c), the Decision will become the final action of the Commission
25 days after the date of issuance unless the Commission on its own motion institutes a review of the Decision within
that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Circular provides guidance and instructions on the management of Federal advisory committees and requires
Executive Departments and agencies to establish a committee planning and review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 10, 1993, the President signed Executive Order 12838, ``Termination and Limitation of Federal Advisory
Committees,'' which requires each Executive Department and agency to reduce the number of discretionary committees
by one-third. New discretionary advisory committees are subject to review and approval by the Director of OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 28, 1994, the Vice President issued a memorandum reiterating Administration policy regarding the maintenance
of the reduction targets mandated by Executive Order 12838, as well as new guidance relating to Executive Branch action
on advisory committees proposed by statute. The Vice President's memorandum also called for additional savings
in committee costs over and above those achieved under E.O. 12838, as recommended by the National Performance Review
(NPR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administration is committed to maintaining advisory committees as a way of ensuring public and expert involvement
and advice in Federal decision-making. At the same time, the number and cost of advisory committees must be carefully
managed. Advisory committees should get down to the public's business, complete it and then go out of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies should review and eliminate advisory committees that are obsolete, duplicative, low priority or serve
a special, rather than national interest. New advisory committees should be established only when essential to the
attainment of clearly defined Executive Branch priorities, as defined by E.O. 12838, and when they will not exceed
an agency's advisory committee ceiling as established by the Executive order's reduction requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administration will generally not support the establishment of new statutory committees or legislative language
that exempts advisory committees from coverage under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). In addition, each
agency should make a concerted effort to work with its Congressional oversight committees to reduce the number of
existing committees required by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this Circular, definitions for ``advisory committee,'' ``agency,'' and other terms are the same
as defined in GSA's implementation regulations for the Federal Advisory Committee Act (41 CFR Part 101&hyph;6).
In addition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``non-discretionary advisory committee'' is an advisory committee either mandated by Presidential directive
or by statute and is subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. A ``non-discretionary advisory committee'' mandated
by statute is: (1) specifically identified by name, specific purpose or function in statute, and (2) a committee whose
creation or termination is beyond an agency's legal discretion. Advisory committees referenced by general (non-specific)
authorizing language or committee report language will not be considered ``non-discretionary.'' In addition,
where a statute requires an advisory committee as defined above, but allows for one or more committees, only one committee
shall be considered to be required by statute.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Required Action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each Executive Department and agency shall report to OMB annually on the results of its efforts to maintain discretionary
committee levels required by E.O. 12838, and other actions to reduce its inventory of non-discretionary statutory
committees. This submission will be used by the Director of OMB as the basis for approving requests to establish new
committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Agency advisory committee management plans will be submitted to OMB and GSA each year and include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) performance measures used to evaluate each committee's progress in achieving its stated goals or mission; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) plans for the establishment of any new advisory committees during the coming fiscal year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) a summary of actions taken to ensure the advisory committee reduction goal is maintained; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) the results of a review of non-discretionary advisory committees and plans to continue, terminate or merge these
groups through legislation. This will include a list of those committees established by specific statutory authority
during the current fiscal year regardless of their coverage under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

(2) With regard to non-discretionary advisory committees mandated by statute, the agency will notify GSA of plans
to establish such committees prior to filing the charter required by section 9(c) of the Federal Advisory Committee
Act. Such notification will provide GSA with at least 10 working days to review the proposed committee charter and
advise the agency of its recommendations.

The Coast Guard, EPA, RSPA, and MMS developed the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) to provide
guidelines for compliance with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 pollution response exercise requirements (33 U.S.C.
1321 (j)). One section of the PREP focuses on Area exercises, which are designed to evaluate the entire response mechanism
in a given Area to ensure adequate pollution response preparedness. The goal of the PREP is to conduct 20 Area exercises
per year, with the intent of exercising most Areas of the country over a three year period. In the March 25, 1994, edition

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The National Scheduling Coordinating Committee (NSCC), comprised of representatives of the Coast Guard, EPA,
RSPA, and MMS, meets in January of each year to develop a proposed Area exercise schedule for the upcoming three year
period. (For example, when the NSCC meets in 1995, the three years considered will be 1996, 1997 and 1998.) The information
in the proposed schedule includes: the exercise Area, the exercise quarter, whether the exercise is industry-led
or government-led, and the type of industry that will lead the exercise (vessel, marine transportation-related
(mtr) facility, non-marine transportation-related facility, offshore facility or pipeline). Once developed,
the proposed schedule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in February of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The NSCC solicits input on the proposed schedule for each three year period. The NSCC also requests industry plan
holders to lead the Area exercise or participate in the government-led Area exercises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Once comments are received by the NSCC, they are considered and acted upon, as appropriate. Where there is conflict,
every effort is made to resolve it while maintaining the integrity of the scheduling process.

Selection of Industry Participants for Area Exercises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The selection process for industry participants for the Area exercises is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Industry response plan holders interested in leading the Area exercises or supporting the government-led Area
exercises should submit their requests directly to the USCG or EPA On-Scene Coordinator. These requests should be
submitted as soon as possible after the proposed schedule is published, but no later than 6 months prior to the proposed
exercise date. Once the OSC has chosen an industry plan holder for an exercise, the OSC will contact the NSCC in writing
to the address listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In Areas where no plan holders have come forth and expressed an interest in leading or participating in the Area exercises,
OSCs will recommend industry plan holders for exercise participation to the NSCC. Some issues that will be considered
when selecting industry participants include the number of times a specific industry has conducted exercises in
the past, the operating history of industries in the Area and the perceived need for a particular industry plan holder
to be exercised. The OSCs will consult with the selected industry plan holders prior to submitting their names for
exercise participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In Areas scheduled for exercises involving pipelines or offshore facilities, the OSCs will coordinate with the
respective regulatory agency (RSPA or MMS) to select plan holders to lead or participate in these exercises.

Scheduling Workshop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A PREP scheduling workshop was conducted by the NSCC on May 19, 1994. Similar workshops will continue to be held annually
in May. The workshops will continue to focus primarily on the upcoming year's Area exercise schedule, but also will
address issues relating to the following two years of the triennial schedule. National level industry representation
is strongly encouraged at these workshops, as this is an opportunity for industry plan holders to comment on the schedule
and address issues which may affect them and their operations. Input from the workshops will continue to be used for
finalizing the upcoming year's schedule and proposing the schedule for the following two years.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is the final PREP Schedule for Calendar Years 1995, 1996, and 1997. All of the comments received were
incorporated, as appropriate. Where no industry plan holders have come forward to either participate or lead an exercise,
the OSCs will solicit and recommend plan holders. Companies that wish to participate should contact the USCG or EPA
OSC, who will then forward the name to the NSCC at the address listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. The Coast Guard will continue to publish a final schedule in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Transit Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued a notice on September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46878) seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals and information from transit authorities, planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials, States, the private sector, and the public on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA's Innovative Financing Initiative. This initiative is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrastructure Investments,'' signed by President Clinton on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 26, 1994, which directs each executive department ``to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure efficient management of infrastructure * * * and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``encourage private sector investment which is a key objective of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our efforts to promote innovative financing.'' Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Transportation Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA to explore innovative ways to finance the transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of our nation, taking into account a continuing Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment to transit, as well as a growing private sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in transportation investment. Hence, the FTA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in identifying ways for States and localities to plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and execute integrated public transit investment programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original comment period would end on October 30, 1994. FTA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is extending the comment period for an additional 60 days, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to allow interested parties adequate time to formulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their comments and/or proposals. The comment period will now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 This notice grants the petition by American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) for an exemption from the parts marking
requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for a high theft car line whose nameplate is confidential.
This petition is granted because the agency has determined that the antitheft device to be placed on the car line as
standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with
parts marking requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a letter dated April 29, 1994, American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (Honda) requested an exemption from the theft
prevention standard for a car line beginning from the (confidential) model year. The nameplate of the car line is also
confidential. The letter was submitted pursuant to 49 CFR part 543, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption from Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
and requested an exemption from parts marking based on the installation of an antitheft device as standard equipment
for the car line. In a June 29, 1994 telephone conversation with NHTSA officials, Honda clarified the scope of its petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Together, Honda's April 29 letter and information provided in the June 29 telephone conversation constitute a complete
petition, as required by 49 CFR &sect;543.7, in that it met the general requirements contained in &sect;543.5 and
the specific content requirements of &sect;543.6. In a letter dated May 31, 1994 to Honda, the agency granted the petitioner's
request for confidential treatment of most aspects of its petition, including the nameplate of the car line and the
model year of its introduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition, Honda provided a detailed description and diagrams of the identity, design, and location of the components
of the antitheft device for the new car line. The antitheft device includes an engine starter interrupt function and
an alarm function. The antitheft device is activated by removing the key from the ignition and locking the driver or
passenger door with the key.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alarm monitors the doors, hood, trunk lid, battery terminals, engine starter circuit, and battery circuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure the reliability and durability of the device, Honda stated that it conducted tests, based on its
own specified standards. Honda provided a detailed list of the tests conducted, including tests for temperature
extremes, vibration, shock, and power voltage. Honda stated its belief that the device is reliable and durable since
the device complied with Honda's specified requirements for each test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda compared the device proposed for its new car line with devices which NHTSA has determined to be as effective in
reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda concludes that the antitheft device proposed for its new car line is not less effective than those devices in
the above car lines for which NHTSA has granted exemptions from the parts-marking requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this substantial evidence, the agency believes that the antitheft device for the new Honda car line is likely
to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with the parts-marking requirements
of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the device will provide the types of performance listed in 49 CFR 543.6(a)(3): Promoting
activation; attracting attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumvention of the device by
unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the reliability
and durability of the device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 49 U.S.C. 33106 and 49 CFR 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that Honda has provided adequate reasons
for its belief that the antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information Honda
provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by
Honda for the antitheft device and its components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the Honda car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole,
from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If Honda decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally notify
the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under 49 CFR &sect;&sect;541.5
and 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has attempted to compare the effectiveness of compliance with the theft prevention standard (parts marking)
with the effectiveness of antitheft devices. NHTSA has compared the theft rates of 17 parts-marked MY 1986 vehicle
lines, with the theft rates of the same 17 lines in MY 1991, when each line had an exemption from parts marking because
it had an antitheft device as standard equipment. Of the 17 lines reviewed, 10 experienced theft rates for MY 1991 that
were below their respective rates in MY 1986. Although the results of the data are inconclusive, it indicates a likelihood
of lower theft rates for vehicle lines that have been exempted from parts marking because they are equipped with an
antitheft device. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates
more probative data upon which comparisons may be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that if Honda wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may
have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Section 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to
vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption
is based. Further, &sect;543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit
the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which &sect;543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle
manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification
petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes
could be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be
characterized as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify.

with offices of the Department of the Treasury, announce a competition for $10,000,000 in grant money to assist an
institution (or consortium of institutions) in the State of Texas in the planning, establishment, and operation
of a Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade (Center). The Center is to conduct year-round programs that
promote and study trade between and among Western Hemisphere countries. This notice is to obtain a list of interested
Texas institutions that wish to be considered in the award of the grant money.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Once the list is compiled, Customs will establish a committee to develop criteria for evaluating eligible institutions,

sector authorities with respect to selecting, planning, and establishing the Center. Consideration will be given
to an institution's ability to carry out the Center's designated programs and activities and to any resources the
institution can provide the Center in addition to any Federal funds provided.

Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the United States Postal Service (USPS) propose
to conduct a computer matching program. The purpose of the program is to identify and locate USPS employees who owe
delinquent debts to the Federal Government as a result of their participation in benefit programs administered by
VA. Once identified and located, VA will pursue collection of debts through voluntary payments. If such payments
are not forthcoming, VA may request USPS to offset up to 15 percent of the employees' disposable pay as authorized under
the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legal authority for undertaking this matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L.
97&hyph;365), 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government,
31 U.S.C. 3711 (Collection and Compromise) and 5 U.S.C. 5514 (Installment Deduction for Indebtedness). These statutes
authorize Federal agencies to offset a Federal employee's salary as a means of satisfying delinquent debts owed the
United States. VA and USPS have concluded an agreement to conduct the matching program pursuant to provisions of the
Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(o)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USPS will act as the recipient (i.e., matching) agency. VA will provide a tape extract to USPS that contains the name
and social security number (SSN) of each record subject. USPS will compare the tape extract against its database of
employee records, establishing ``hits'' (i.e., individuals common to both tapes) on the basis of matched SSN's.
For each hit, USPS will disclose to VA the following information: name, SSN, home address and employee type (permanent
or temporary).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Records to be Matched
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies from which records will be disclosed for the purpose
of this computer match are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USPS: Finance Records_Payroll System (USPS 050.020) containing records of approximately 700,000 employees. Disclosure
will be made under routine use 24 of that system, a full description of which was last published at 57 FR 57515 (December
4, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VA: (a) ``Compensation, Pension, Education and Rehabilitation Records_VA'' (58VA21/22) appearing at page 967
of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. The exchange of data under this agreement is
consistent with routine uses 9 and 12 of 58VA21/22. (b) ``Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan
Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records and Vendee Loan Applicant Records_VA'' (55VA26),
appearing at page 962 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. The exchange of data under
this agreement is consistent with routine use 19 of 55VA26. The debtor records actually used to perform the match are
maintained in the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS). CARS records, which number about 500,000, are
a subset of those found in both Privacy Act systems of records listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The matching program is expected to begin on or about November 25, 1994, and continue in effect for 18 months. Matching
activity will begin no sooner than 30 days after publication of this notice or 40 days after a report of this matching
program has been provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), whichever is later. The agreement
governing the matching program and, thus, the matching program, may be extended an additional 12 months with the respective
approval of VA's and USPS' Data Integrity Boards. Such extension must occur within three months prior to expiration
of the 18-month period set forth above and under the terms set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2)(D).
