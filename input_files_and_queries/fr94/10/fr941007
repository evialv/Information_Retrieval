SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service is implementing a new rulemaking procedure to expedite making noncontroversial
changes to its regulations. Rules that the agency judges to be non-controversial and unlikely to result in adverse
comments will be published as ``direct final'' rules. (``Adverse comments'' are comments that suggest that a rule
should not be adopted or suggest that a change should be made to the rule.) Each direct final rule will advise the public
that no adverse comments are anticipated, and that unless written adverse comments or written notice of intent to
submit adverse comments are received within 30 days, the revision made by the rule will be effective 60 days from the
date the direct final rule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. This new policy should expedite the promulgation of routine or otherwise noncontroversial rules by reducing the
time that would be required to develop, review, clear, and publish separate proposed and final rules.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service is committed to improving the efficiency of its regulatory process. In pursuit
of this goal, we plan to employ the rulemaking procedure known as ``direct final rulemaking'' to promulgate some Agricultural
Marketing Service rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direct Final Rule Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rules that the Agricultural Marketing Service judges to be noncontroversial and unlikely to result in adverse comments
will be published as direct final rules. Each direct final rule will advise the public that no adverse comments are
anticipated, and that unless written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments are
received within 30 days, the revision made by the direct final rule will be effective 60 days from the date the direct
final rule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Adverse comments'' are comments that suggest that the rule should not be adopted, or that suggest that a change should
be made to the rule. A comment expressing support for the rule as published will not be considered adverse. Further,
a comment suggesting that requirements in the rule should, or should not, be employed by the Agricultural Marketing
Service in other programs or situations outside the scope of the direct final rule will not be considered adverse.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the direct final
rulemaking procedure gives the public general notice of the Agricultural Marketing Service's intent to adopt a rule,
and gives interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of comments. The
major feature of direct final rulemaking is that if the Agricultural Marketing Service receives no written adverse
comments and no written notice of intent to submit adverse comments within 30 days of the publication of the direct
final rule, the rule will become effective without the need to publish a separate final rule. However, the Agricultural
Marketing Service will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stating that no adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule, and confirming that the direct final
rule is effective on the date stated in the direct final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Agricultural Marketing Service receives written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse
comments within 30 days of the publication of a direct final rule, a notice of withdrawal of the direct final rule will
be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the Agricultural Marketing Service intends to proceed with the rulemaking, the direct final rule will be republished
as a proposed rule and we will proceed with the normal notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.

Determining When to Use Direct Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not all Agricultural Marketing Service rules are good candidates for direct final rulemaking. The Agricultural
Marketing Service intends to use the direct final rulemaking procedure only for rules that we consider to be noncontroversial
and unlikely to generate adverse comments. The decision to use direct final rulemaking for a rule will be based on the
Agricultural Marketing Service experience with similar rules.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule requires the use of the Protein Digestibility- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) instead of the Protein Efficiency Ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(PER) for evaluating the biological quality of proteins in enriched macaroni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products with fortified protein. This action is necessary for consistency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Nutrition Labeling Education Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The PDCAAS is a more accurate, efficient and less costly method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for measuring protein quality of this food product used in the National School 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lunch Program (NSLP). This rule also makes clear that enriched macaroni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products may not be used for infants under one year of age. In addition, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule deletes reference in the NSLP regulations to the FDA Standard of Identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(21 CFR 139.117) for enriched macaroni products with fortified protein which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been stayed by FDA and clarifies that protein quality is to be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the dry basis not on the cooked food. This rule also makes a typographical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction and in accordance with the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 adds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metric equivalent for all weights and measurements. This final rule further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies that manufacturers of enriched macaroni with fortified protein must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) if there is a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein content of their product after the original testing. FNS will assume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protein content of the product remains the same as that submitted for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original testing unless otherwise notified.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). The Administrator of FNS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. There are currently fewer than ten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies participating in the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. In addition, the changes contained in this regulation are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to reduce costs for the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator of FNS has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that notice and comment on this rule prior to implementation is unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and contrary to public interest. The public interest would be better served 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by allowing a more accurate and efficient method for measuring the protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of foods used in the NSLP. This change will allow food companies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize costs, thereby allowing them to provide quality products at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowest cost possible. Moreover, receiving prior comment would be unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and impracticable in this case for the following reasons. First, requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior notice and comment would waste valuable government resources. The Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already have received and reviewed comments on this issue in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rules governing nutrition labeling of all regulated products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including products covered by this FNS regulation, and have published final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations which accept the PDCAAS method. Second, FNS, with FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrence, has already recognized the merits of the PDCAAS method in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitting its use for vegetable protein products (VPPs). Third, this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides affected parties an implementation period of 30 days during which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either protein quality test may be used for enriched macaroni products.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Date'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this rule or the application of the provisions, all applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the NSLP, the administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are set forth under the following regulations: (1) school food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority appeals of State agency findings as a result of a Coordinated Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must follow State agency hearing procedures as established pursuant to 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
210.18(q); (2) school food authority appeals of FNS findings as a result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coordinated Review must follow FNS hearing procedures as established pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 7 CFR 210.30(d)(3); AND (3) State agency appeals of State Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expense fund sanctions (7 CFR 235.11(b)) must follow the FNS Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review Process as established pursuant to 7 CFR 235.11(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NSLP is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10.555 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and final rule-related notice at 48 FR 29114, June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24, 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new data collection or recordkeeping requiring Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3501 through 3502) are included in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background: On March 27, 1974, the Department published final regulations (39 FR 11248) which defined enriched macaroni
products with fortified protein as a food item meeting the NSLP meal pattern requirements specified in 7 CFR 210.10
under specified terms and conditions. At that time, the PER was the only recognized test for determining the biological
quality of protein in foods. At present, there is another recognized method for determining the biological quality
of protein in foods, the PDCAAS method. Several international bodies, including a Joint Expert Consultation on Protein
Evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization
(WHO) (1989), have concluded that PDCAAS, in which a score of 1.0 equals 100 percent of the 1985 WHO essential amino
acid requirement patterns for 2 to 5 year olds, is an appropriate method for evaluating food protein quality. The 2
to 5 year old requirement is the most inclusive of those recommended and thus may be used for all age groups, except infants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PER is based on the assumption that proteins which are equivalent to casein meet the amino acid and protein requirements
for the various age groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consuming a particular food. The specification of this methodology, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon rodent nutrition requirements, was assumed to correlate to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements when PER was adopted as the sole regulatory method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining protein quality. Extensive studies have since been conducted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human amino acid requirements which demonstrate that the essential amino acid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of humans are significantly different from those of rodents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This was recognized as early as 1980 by a conference of protein scientists and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritionists held to assess protein quality in humans. A report of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working conference indicated a dissatisfaction with the PER method. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report further recognized that an amino acid scoring system, corrected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
digestibility, is an appropriate alternative for measuring protein value.

In 1985, WHO published its revised Energy and Protein Requirement Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by a Joint Expert Consultation of the FAO/WHO and United Nations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
University (UNU). This consultation revised amino acid pattern requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for humans into age groups of 2 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, and adult, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensively reviewed the requirements based on amino acid scoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
digestibility. Of the three amino acid patterns established, the 2 to 5 year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
old child pattern has the highest individual and total requirements. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report stated that protein and diets containing essential amino acids that met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the greater needs of young children were also adequate for older children and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults, whereas the reverse may not be true. On this basis, the Joint FAO/WHO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expert Consultation on Protein Evaluation (1989) concluded that no adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis existed for using different scoring patterns for different age groups, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the exception of infants, who have a much greater need for essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amino acids. They recommended that the FAO/WHO/UNU amino acid scoring pattern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for preschool children should be used to evaluate protein quality for all age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, except infants. PDCAAS was recommended for calculating dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein intakes. Thus, precise human amino acid requirement patterns are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for all age groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both FNS and the FDA have recognized the applicability and usefulness of the PDCAAS method of measuring protein quality.
The regulation governing the use of VPP in the Child Nutrition Programs, 7 CFR Parts 210, 225 and 226, Appendix A - Alternate
Foods for Meals; Vegetable Protein Products, published January 7, 1983, allowed FNS to approve an alternate test
for measuring the biological quality of protein for VPP. This provision was included in the regulation in anticipation
of recognition by the scientific community and FDA of the PDCAAS. FNS has since accepted the PDCAAS method in addition
to the PER method for determining protein quality of VPP. This acceptance was based on the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation
on Protein Evaluation (1989) and with FDA's concurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29487 at 29499), FDA stated that their regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements to use PER ``inhibit(ed) flexibility in determining protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality by alternative methodologies.'' At that time, FDA proposed to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of the PER, while also allowing use of alternative acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validated procedures as they become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, in response to a petition from Protein Technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International, Inc., FDA stated in the preamble to the nutrition labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal published on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60369), that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitting PDCAAS to be used as an alternative to PER had merit. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenting on that petition FDA quoted its earlier comments on the need for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexible approach to determining protein quality:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As new methodologies and new information on amino acid requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various age groups become available, the agency believes it must become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more flexible in regard to permitted protein quality methodologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, while the PER method described in the Official Methods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists may continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used as one of the methods for assessing the protein quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods, alternative acceptable validated procedures may be used as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become available. (55 FR 29487 at 29499).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, FDA later proposed to require the PDCAAS, stating in the preamble (56 FR 60366 at 60370) that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has reviewed the FAO/WHO report and tentatively accepts its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method is more appropriate for assessing protein quality of foods than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal assays and is preferable for regulatory purposes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In October, 1989, the Subcommittee on the 10th Edition of the Recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dietary Allowances published the revised Recommended Dietary Allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These new allowances confirm and accept the amino acid requirement pattern as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published by the WHO, 1985, and recognize PDCAAS as an appropriate method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing protein quality of human diets. The amino acid requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 to 5 year old suggested by both of these scientific bodies are identical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Codex Alimentarius Vegetable Protein Committee as well as the Codex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee on Special Dietary Foods have also recommended amino acid scoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for evaluation of vegetable proteins and special dietary foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDCAAS was considered and accepted by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission which convened in Geneva,
Switzerland during July 1989. An Expert Consultation convened at the request of the Codex Alimentarius Commission
reviewed the amino acid scoring methodologies and recommended the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the PDCAAS for measuring protein quality. After extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberation, resulting in a comprehensive report, it was reported that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``. . . the Consultation agreed that the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acid Score method was the most suitable approach for routine evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein quality for humans, and recommended the adoption of this method as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official method at the international level.'' (Joint FAO/WHO Expert 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultation on Protein Evaluation, Codex Alimentarius, Washington, D.C., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989). The Expert Consultation's report and recommendations were transmitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the FAO Secretariat in Rome for final review and dissemination to the Codex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alimentarius Commission membership. The report of the Expert Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains many findings and conclusions, most supportive of the PDCAAS. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions adverse to this method were reported.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules (58 FR 2079) requiring use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PDCAAS method as the method for determining protein quality for food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended for children over 1 year of age and adults. While this method is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended for all children above 1 year of age, it is not recommended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants, and therefore FDA's final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2102) retained the PER 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for assessing protein quality and retained casein as the standard in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressing the percentage of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for protein in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods represented and purported to be for use by infants. This rule became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective on May 8, 1994. In recognition of these scientific advances and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption by FDA of PDCAAS as the only method for determining protein quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for children above one year of age, this rule amends the NSLP regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix A of Part 210 to require PDCAAS as the only method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein quality for enriched macaroni. However, in order to provide affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties an implementation period, the amended paragraph 2 further provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that for 30 days after publication of the rule either the PER or the PDCAAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a new paragraph 1(c) is added to Appendix A to make clear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enriched macaroni may not be used for infants under 1 year of age in the NSLP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FNS will no longer approve enriched macaroni products purported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use by infants regardless of what method their protein quality has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested. It was never the Department's intention that enriched macaroni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products be served to infants and this amendment is meant to make clear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of enriched macaroni with fortified protein, currently approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by FNS, will not be affected by the change to an alternate method unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional composition of their approved product changes. Should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional composition of an approved product previously tested under PER 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method change after the 30 day implementation period, data obtained by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDCAAS method will be required for re-approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA Standard of Identity (21 CFR 139.117), referenced and quoted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A and upon which the FNS final regulation was based, was stayed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 21, 1978, pending a determination of whether a public hearing was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to resolve issues raised by objections (43 FR 11695). At that time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA stated that ``during the period of the stay, the (enriched macaroni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products with fortified protein) may be introduced into interstate commerce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with appropriate labeling as a nonstandardized food.'' (43 FR 11695). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this rule deletes all references to that Standard in Appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the requirements for processing and labeling of enriched macaroni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products with fortified protein prescribed by FDA in the stayed Standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identity were previously incorporated in the FNS final rule and will remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same, with some technical changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this final rule amends the current regulation to correct a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement which has caused confusion and which was recently brought to our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention by analytical laboratories. The current regulation states that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein quality is to be determined on the cooked food. However, determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein quality on the cooked food is not feasible in practice, because when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing the PER method the moisture content prevents laboratory rodents from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eating test foods in sufficient quantities to accurately determine protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality. Likewise, the moisture content in the cooked food may affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test results under the PDCAAS method. Therefore, FAO/WHO suggests a moisture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content in the cooked food of less than ten percent for viable testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determinations made on a dry basis has been the procedure commonly employed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial laboratories in the past. Thus, this rule requires determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of protein quality on a dry basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule makes a typographical correction and, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Metric Conversion Act of 1975, adds, side by side, the metric equivalent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all weights and measurements contained in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also includes a clarification that all manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including those with currently accepted macaroni products, must notify FNS if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a change in the protein portion of their product since the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data submission and product approval. FNS will assume the protein content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains the same unless otherwise notified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All laboratory analyses are to be performed by independent or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories acceptable to FNS. (FNS prefers an independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory.) All laboratories shall retain the ``raw'' laboratory data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a period of 1 year. Such information shall be made available to FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon request. Manufacturers must notify FNS if there is a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein portion of their product after the original testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers who report such a change in protein in a previously

it to be classified as a Dietary Supplement as described by the Food and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drug Administration (FDA) in 21 CFR part 105. To be accepted by FNS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enriched macaroni products with fortified protein must conform to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(1) Each of these foods is produced by drying formed units of dough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made with one or more of the milled wheat ingredients designated in 21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 139.110(a) and 139.138(a), and other ingredients to enable the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) The protein content (N x 6.25) is not less than 20 percent by weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(on a 13 percent moisture basis) as determined by the appropriate method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of analysis in the AOAC manual cited in (a)(2) under Enriched Macaroni 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix. The protein quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not less than 95 percent that of casein as determined on a dry basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the PDCAAS method as described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The PDCAAS shall be determined by the methods given in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.4.1, 7.2.1. and 8.0 as described in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990, as published by the Food and Agriculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations/World Health Organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(WHO). This report is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of this report may be obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This report may also be inspected at the Office of the Federal Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800 North Capitol St., NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The standard used for assessing protein quality in the PDCAAS method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the amino acid scoring pattern established by FAO/WHO and United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nations University (UNU) in 1985 for preschool children 2 to 5 years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age which has been adopted by the National Academy of Sciences, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) To calculate the PDCAAS for an individual food, the test food must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be analyzed for proximate analysis and amino acid composition according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to AOAC methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The PDCAAS may be calculated using FDA's limited data base of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published true digestibility values (determined using humans and rats). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The true digestibility values contained in the WHO/FAO report referenced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph 3.(a)(2)(i)(A) under Enriched Macaroni Products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fortified Protein in this Appendix may also be used. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
digestibility of the protein is not available from these sources it must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined by a laboratory according to methods in the FAO/WHO report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sections 7.2.1 and 8.0). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The most limiting essential amino acid (that is, the amino acid that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is present at the lowest level in the test food compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard) is identified in the test food by comparing the levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual amino acids in the test food with the 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern of essential amino acids established as a standard for children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 to 5 years of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The value of the most limiting amino acid (the ratio of the amino 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid in the test food over the amino acid value from the pattern) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplied by the percent of digestibility of the protein. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting number is the PDCAAS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) The PDCAAS of food mixtures must be calculated from data for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amino acid composition and digestibility of the individual components by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of a weighted average procedure. An example for calculating a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDCAAS for a food mixture of varying protein sources is shown in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule clarifies registered handler application and approval procedures and the Florida Tomato Committee's
(committee) authority to cancel a handler's certificate of registration for good cause. The rule also clarifies
that only registered handlers of Florida tomatoes may ship such tomatoes in interstate commerce. This rule also adds
special purpose shipment outlets, redefines one of those outlets, and brings the order's special purpose shipment
provisions into conformity with each other. Finally, this rule provides that handlers must report packout information
on a daily basis to the committee or an authorized agent of the committee. This rule is expected to enhance compliance
with the order and regulations and bring the regulations into conformity with current industry practices. The amendments
were unanimously recommended by the committee. In addition, the Department of Agriculture (Department) makes conforming
changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 966 [7 CFR part 966], both as amended, regulating the handling
of tomatoes grown in Florida. The order is authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform and is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 50 handlers of Florida tomatoes subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately
250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms, including tomato handlers, are defined
by the Small Business Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the tomato handlers and producers may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 31, 1994, the committee met to discuss the difficulty it has experienced in collecting assessments from a few
handlers and in receiving complete, up-to-date packout information from some handlers. The committee recommended
several modifications to the order's existing rules and regulations to improve these situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Handler Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, pursuant to &sect;966.323 Handling regulation, fresh market shipments of tomatoes by handlers to points
outside the regulated area must meet grade, size, inspection, and container requirements. Fresh market shipments
within the regulated area are not subject to such requirements. Fresh market shipments within and outside the regulated
area are subject to assessments. The regulated area is defined as the portion of the State of Florida which is bounded
by the Suwannee River, the Georgia Border, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Basically, it is the entire State
of Florida, except the Panhandle. The production area is part of the regulated area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;966.113 Registered handler, and for the purpose of this order, registered handlers are persons who have
adequate facilities for grading tomatoes for market and who assume initial responsibility for compliance with inspection,
assessment, reporting, and other regulatory requirements concerning tomatoes grown in the production area. Any
person who wishes to become a registered handler is required to make an application for registration with the committee
on forms prescribed by, and available at the principle office of, the committee. If the applicant has facilities which
are determined by the committee as adequate for grading tomatoes, the applicant may be approved as a registered handler.
``Adequate facilities'' are currently defined as those being in a permanent location with nonportable equipment
for the proper grading, sizing and packing of tomatoes. The committee recommended two minor additions to the definition:
(1) The term ``washing'' should be added to the definition, as that activity is an integral part of the handling process;
and (2) the phrase ``grown in the production area'' be added at the end of the definition to further identify the tomatoes
being handled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most tomatoes produced in Florida are shipped fresh to markets outside the regulated area. The committee's goal is
to avoid marketing problems associated with poor quality tomato shipments. The industry has spent substantial sums
of money to promote Florida tomatoes to the trade and consumers. Such expenditures are predicated on the shipment
by handlers of good quality tomatoes, which buyers have come to expect from Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reported that it has been difficult to collect assessments from some handlers in the past. One handler
indicates no intention of paying assessments this year. Because of these compliance difficulties, and to foster
shipments of good quality tomatoes, the committee recommended changes in the rules and regulations to strengthen
the registered handler procedures, clarify handler responsibilities under the order, and enhance the committee's
compliance capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended amending &sect;966.113 and adopting new provisions which would: (1) Establish that registered
handlers must be certified by the committee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) provide the committee with the authority, criteria, and procedures for approving registered handler certifications
and for cancelling such certifications for failure to pay assessments or provide reports to the committee; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) allow only registered handlers to lawfully ship tomatoes outside of the regulated area. After considering the
committee's recommendations, the Department has determined that the changes in this interim rule are necessary
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;966.113 contains an introductory statement explaining the criteria that a handler must meet to be registered
under the order. These provisions include having adequate facilities and being certified by the committee as a registered
handler, handling tomatoes in compliance with order requirements, obtaining inspection, submitting required
reports, and paying applicable assessments. Four of these provisions are currently specified in &sect;966.113.
The provisions for certification as a registered handler and submission of reports are added in this rule to help the
committee with its compliance responsibilities and improve marketing assistance provided to handlers under the
order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New paragraph (a) establishes qualifications for registered handler certification. The committee or its duly authorized
agent inspects handling facilities to determine if those facilities meet the requirements for certification. The
facilities must be located in the regulated area and be permanent, non-portable buildings. The equipment in the facilities
must also be nonportable and capable of properly washing, grading, sizing, and packing of tomatoes grown in the production
area. These requirements are the same as those in the current definition for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adequate facilities 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in paragraph (e) of &sect;966.323, with the addition of washing as an activity and the reference to where the tomatoes
are produced. The definition is removed from paragraph (e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;966.323 and, as modified, added to new paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;966.113 to define, in the appropriate place in the rules and regulations, the kind of facilities and equipment
needed for certification as a registered handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (b) of &sect;966.113 specifies the information requested by the committee in the application for registered
handler certification. The information requested is common business identification information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (c) of &sect;966.113 provides that the committee or an agent of the committee make the determination
that an applicant's facilities meet requirements. Such certification will be made in writing by the committee. Denial
of certification, and the basis thereof, will also be made in writing to the applicant by the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (d) of &sect;966.113 establishes criteria for cancellation of a registered handler's certification,
with the approval of the Secretary, based on failure to pay assessments on a timely basis and failure to provide required
reports. A registered handler's certification will also be subject to cancellation, with the approval of the Secretary,
if the handler no longer has adequate facilities, as that term is defined in &sect;966.113(a). A cancelled certification
will be reinstated once a handler demonstrates compliance with assessment, reporting and facility requirements.
New paragraph (d) also includes the exemption, currently in &sect;966.113, concerning persons who make deliveries
of ungraded tomatoes to handling facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (e) of &sect;966.113 provides that any inspection certificate of tomatoes offered for inspection
by a non-registered handler contains a statement to that effect. The inspection certificate for all such tomato lots
will read ``Fails to meet the requirements of Marketing Order No. 966 because the handler is not a registered handler.''
Such failing certificate will be issued, regardless of the grade, size or containerization of the tomatoes inspected.
The committee will keep the Federal State Inspection Service (inspection service) abreast of all handlers' status.
Any handler who is denied a registered handler certificate or who has a registered handler certificate cancelled,
may appeal to the committee for reconsideration. Such appeal must be made in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Road Guard Bureau of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services releases tomato shipments
for interstate commerce only if the inspection certificates indicate that such shipments meet marketing order requirements.
Thus, persons or handlers not certified as a registered handler by the committee will not be able to ship tomatoes outside
the regulated area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended that this provision be included under a separate title and paragraph. Because inspection
certification is dependent on handler certification, the Department includes this recommendation as part of the
new provision on certified registered handlers in &sect;966.113. For emphasis and to provide consistency in regulations,
the Department also adds this requirement to paragraph (a)(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 966.113 provides that handlers must pay assessments on a timely basis to maintain their registered handler

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Certificates of Privilege 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The committee recommended changing an incorrect citation in the first sentence of &sect;966.120 Application for
Certificate of Privilege which incorrectly refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;966.53 of the order. The committee states that the intent of the section is to require Certificates of Privilege
for special purpose shipments authorized in &sect;966.54 Shipments for special purposes. Thus, &sect;966.54 is
referenced in the first sentence of the paragraph. This adjustment does not change current practices as the committee's
use of Certificates of Privilege is consistent with &sect;966.54 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also changes &sect;966.120 to be consistent with the outlets specified in &sect;966.323 Handling regulations.
One outlet currently specified in &sect;966.120 is changed and three new outlets are added. The term ``processing''
replaces the term ``canning'' to make the regulations consistent with current industry practice. Pickling, experimental
purposes and export, which are currently specified in &sect;966.323(b), are added to &sect;966.120. The committee
also proposed that it have the authority, with the Secretary's approval, to add other outlets to meet changing food
technologies and services which could benefit from receiving tomatoes shipped under Certificate of Privilege.
This authority is added to &sect;966.120. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department makes conforming changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of &sect;966.323 to make that paragraph consistent with the changes to &sect;966.120. The term ``canning''
is changed to ``processing'' and committee authority to add special purpose outlets, with the Secretary's approval,
is added as conforming changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also adds a definition for ``processing'' to paragraph (e) &sect;966.323 Definitions. ``Processing''
is defined as the manufacture of any tomato product which has been converted into juice, or preserved by any commercial
process, including canning, dehydrating, drying, and the addition of chemical substances. Also, paragraph (e)
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;966.323, as provided herein, is redesignated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Packout Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The committee also recommended that all handlers be required to present daily packout reports to the inspection service.
The inspection service currently collects these reports from most handlers for inspection billing purposes and
sends a daily packout report to the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, all handlers maintain records of their daily packout activity based on the grade, size, and containers
of tomatoes handled. The inspection service collects this data at the end of each work day for inspection billing purposes.
As a service to the committee and tomato handlers, the inspection service compiles this information (received from
its various inspectors) and reports it to the committee at the end of the day or the following morning. The committee
compiles this data into a daily, industry-wide, packout report. The report is considered an indispensable tool for
handlers to assess daily tomato market conditions and is disseminated, upon request, to registered handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some handlers fail to provide their packout data to the inspection service on a timely basis to allow inclusion
of the handler's data in each daily, industry-wide report. To be a useful tool, the industry-wide report must be accurate
and include, to the extent possible, the total industry packout. Because the report is such a valuable marketing tool
for handlers, the committee voted unanimously to propose that each registered handler be required to report the handler's
daily packout data to the inspection service in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The packout data that handlers provide to the inspection service, to the committee directly, or to another agent of
the committee is data that is routinely compiled by each handler as part of the handler's normal, daily operating records.
The reporting deadline of the end of the working day, as designated by the committee, will not present an undue burden
on handlers because the data requested is routinely recorded by handlers at the end of each working day. Individual
handler data collated and disseminated in an industry-wide report will not disclose confidential information or
the business position of individual handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee recommended that this change be added to the rules and regulations as a separate, new number, title and
paragraph. However, because the new provision establishes a reporting requirement on handlers, the Department
inserts the provision as a separate, new paragraph under current &sect;966.323. Thus, a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e) is added to the handling regulation and current paragraph (e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is redesignated as paragraph (g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the committee recommended that a clarification be added to the rules and regulations to clearly state that
handlers must pay assessments to maintain their certification as registered handlers. Failure of some handlers
to pay their assessments places an unfair burden upon those handlers who comply with order requirements. The Department
adds that this clarification to &sect;966.323 handling regulation because payment of assessments is a requirement
of handlers under the order. A new paragraph (f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessments 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is added to &sect;966.323. This paragraph stated that failure of a registered handler to pay assessments in a timely
manner will result in cancellation of the registered handler's status, thus, making that handler ineligible to ship
tomatoes outside of the regulated area. Current committee collection procedures are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weekly assessment billings during the harvest season; (2) payment within 30 days; (3) followed by a demand letter
specifying the end of a 15 day extended notice period; and (4) referral to the Department for legal action. Under this
rule, a handler who has not paid assessments after expiration of the extended notice period provided in the demand
letter will be considered out of compliance and will be reported to the inspection service as a non-registered handler.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paper Work Reduction Act of 1980, [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], the information collection requirement
contained in this rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval and has been assigned
OMB No. 0581&hyph;0073. Because handlers currently complete a form to be certified as a registered handler, no additional
OMB approval is needed for such registration. However, this rule provides that each registered handler, at the end
of each day in which tomatoes are handled by the registered handler, furnish the committee or it's designated agent
an accurate accounting of the number of tomato containers packed that day. This report provides the grade, size, and
containers of tomatoes packed by the handler each packing day. Because the information is readily available from
each day's packout, the report takes five minutes to complete. The committee needs this information to compile a daily
packout report which is used by handlers in their marketing efforts. This provision is consistent with current industry
practice. It is estimated that 50 handlers currently submit daily reports and receive marketing assistance during
the marketing period October 10, through June 15 each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because this rule: (1) clarifies order regulations and makes those regulations consistent with current conditions
in the industry; (2) is expected to improve compliance with order requirements; (3) needs to be in effect as soon as
possible because the marketing season begins on October 10, 1994; (4) was unanimously recommended by the committee
at a public meeting; and (5) provides a 30-day comment period and all comments timely received will be considered prior
to the finalization of this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each handler who handles tomatoes grown in the production area must be certified as a registered handler by the committee
in order to ship such tomatoes outside of the regulated area. A handler who is certified as a registered handler is a
handler who has adequate facilities to meet the requirements for preparing tomatoes for market, obtains inspection
on tomatoes handled, agrees to handle tomatoes in compliance with the order's grade, size and container requirements,
pays applicable assessments on a timely basis, submits reports required by the committee, and agrees to comply with
other regulatory requirements on the handling of tomatoes grown in the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Based on the criteria specified in this section, the committee shall determine eligibility for certification
as a registered handler. The committee or its authorized agent shall inspect a handler's facilities to determine
if the facilities are adequate for preparing tomatoes for market. In order to be adequate for such purposes, the facilities
must be permanent, nonportable buildings located in the production area with equipment that is nonportable for the
proper washing, grading, sizing and packing of tomatoes grown in the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Application for certification shall be executed by the handler and filed with the committee on a form, prescribed
by and available at the principal office of the committee, containing the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Business name, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Address of handling facilities (including telephone and facsimile number), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mailing address (if different from handling facility), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Number of years in tomato business in Florida, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Type of business, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Names of senior officers, partners, or principal owners with financial interest in the business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the committee determines from available information that an applicant meets the criteria specified in this
section, such applicant shall be certified as a registered handler and shall be so informed by written notice from
the committee. If certification is denied, such denial shall be made by the committee in writing, stating the reasons
for denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A registered handler's certification shall be cancelled by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary,
if the handler fails to pay assessments within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45 days of the end of the assessment billing period, fails to provide reports, or no longer has adequate facilities
as described in this section. Cancellation of a handler's registration shall be made in writing to the handler and
shall specify the reason(s) for and effective date of such cancellation. The committee shall recertify the handler's
registration at such time as the handler corrects the deficiencies which resulted in the cancellation. Certification
is permanent until the committee determines, based on criteria herein, that cancellation is warranted. Persons
who make deliveries of ungraded tomatoes to such certified registered handlers are hereby determined to be exempt
from otherwise applicable regulations pursuant to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) During any period in which the handling of tomatoes is regulated pursuant to this part, no handler shall obtain
an inspection certifying that said handler's tomatoes meet the requirements of the marketing order unless said handler
has been certified as a registered handler. Any person who is not certified as a registered handler may receive inspection
on tomatoes from the Federal-State Inspection Service. Such inspection certificate shall state ``Fails to meet
the requirements of Marketing Order No. 966 because the handler is not a registered handler.''

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule will amend the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations to allow certain
persons in the United States to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident before October 1, 1997. These persons,
although immediately eligible for immigrant visa issuance abroad, had been barred from adjustment of status in the
United States because they had committed certain administrative violations of United States immigration law. This
rule allows prospective lawful permanent residents to avoid the difficulties and expense of travel to a United States
consulate or embassy abroad. It continues, however, to penalize these violators of the immigration laws by requiring
most applicants to pay an additional sum in excess of the standard adjustment of status filing fee. After adjusting
status, these persons can lawfully live and work in the United States and may later become eligible to seek United States
citizenship through naturalization.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) allows a person who is neither a citizen nor a national of the United States
to live and work in this country for an unlimited period of time if he or she has been granted lawful permanent resident
status. It also provides for a grant of lawful permanent resident status on a conditional basis for an initial two-year
period, if the residency is based on a recent marriage or on alien entrepreneur status, and allows for the removal of
the conditions upon fulfillment of certain requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Act generally requires a qualified intending immigrant to obtain an immigrant visa abroad before seeking admission
to the United States for lawful permanent residence. It also allows certain persons who have not obtained an immigrant
visa abroad to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident after arrival in the United States. As set forth
in the Act, most persons seeking adjustment of status must show that they could qualify for immigrant visa issuance
abroad and must meet certain additional requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An immigrant visa may be issued only at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. Each prospective immigrant is
required to show that he or she is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immediately available immigrant
visa number through a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The applicant must also establish
that he or she is not included in any of the classes of persons who cannot, by law, be admitted to the United States, or
that any basis for inadmissibility has been waived. After the immigrant visa has been issued, the person may lawfully
travel to the United States. A qualified immigrant visa holder becomes a lawful permanent resident upon admission
to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adjustment of status applicant must be physically present in the United States at the time of application. A person
applying under section 245 of the Act, the most frequently used adjustment of status provision, must meet the basic
requirements for immigrant visa issuance. Like immigrant visa applicants, the adjustment applicant must prove
that he or she is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immediately available immigrant visa number through
a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The adjustment applicant must also show that he or
she is not included in any of the classes of persons who, by law, cannot be admitted to the United States, or that any basis
for inadmissibility has been waived. Section 245(a) of the Act further restricts eligibility for adjustment of status
by prohibiting adjustment unless the applicant entered the United States after having been inspected and admitted
or paroled by an immigrant officer. Section 245(c) of the Act also bars the adjustment of most applicants who have been
employed in the United States without authorization; who have not complied with the terms of temporary nonimmigrant
status; or who entered in transit without visa status, under a visa waiver program, or as crewmen. A qualified adjustment
applicant becomes a lawful permanent resident upon approval of the adjustment of status application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act were established to discourage intending immigrants from
moving to the United States before becoming fully eligible for permanent residence and bypassing the orderly immigrant
visa issuance process abroad. These requirements have caused many persons who are in the United States to be unable
to adjust status in this country.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Intending immigrants who could not meet the adjustment requirements have been obliged to leave the country and apply
for an immigrant visa at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. They then were immediately eligible for admission
as lawful permanent residents upon returning to the United States. By virtue of the requirements of sections 245(a)
and 245(c) of the Act, these persons were putatively required to leave the United States and United States consuls
abroad have been burdened with immigrant visa issuance that would not otherwise have been necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 506(b) of the Department of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103&hyph;317, was enacted August 26, 1994. It temporarily lifts many of the restrictions on adjustment
of status under section 245 of the Act on applications filed on or after October 1, 1994, although it does not affect
persons adjusting under other sections of law. This law adds a new section 245(i) to the Act, which allows a person who
is physically present in the United States and would otherwise have been eligible for immigrant visa issuance abroad,
to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident under section 245 of the Act. Applicants may be subject to a financial
penalty, since the law requires most persons seeking adjustment of status under the new law to pay an additional sum
in excess of the standard adjustment of status filing fee. The provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act cease
to have effect on October 1, 1997.

Persons Who Remain Ineligible To Adjust Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 245(i) of the Act does not waive all requirements for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. An applicant
must be eligible for immigrant classification and have an immediately available immigrant visa number through a
qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The person must also show that he or she is not included
in any of the classes of persons listed in section 212 of the Act who cannot be admitted to the United States, or must show
that any basis for excludability has been waived.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 245(i) of the Act also does not waive several other grounds of ineligibility for adjustment of status under
section 245 of the Act. An applicant seeking adjustment as an immediate relative of a United States citizen or as a preference
alien, but who is not the beneficiary of a valid unexpired visa petition, remains ineligible for adjustment. A person
who is currently a lawful permanent resident also continues to be ineligible for adjustment. An applicant who was
admitted to the United States as a K&hyph;1 fiance(e) but did not marry the United States citizen who filed the petition,
or who was admitted as the K&hyph;2 child of a fiance(e) parent who did not marry the United States citizen who filed
the petition, is also barred from adjusting status under section 245 of the Act. A person who is seeking adjustment
based on a marriage entered into while the applicant was under deportation, exclusion, or related judicial proceedings
may not adjust status, unless the person provides clear and convincing evidence of a bona fide marriage or has resided
outside the United States for two or more years after the marriage.

Payment of Additional Sum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This temporary adjustment provision continues to encourage intending immigrants who are abroad to comply with the
immigrant visa issuance requirements, by making adjustment of status under the new provision much more expensive
than immigrant visa issuance abroad. Most applicants for the new benefit will be required to pay the standard adjustment
of status filing fee, plus an additional sum of five times the standard filing fee. Thus, persons currently applying
for adjustment of status under the provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act must pay the standard filing fee of
$130.00, plus an additional sum of $650.00, for a total of $780.00. Any future modifications of the standard adjustment
of status filing fee will change the amount of the additional sum, as well as the total cost.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Persons who can meet all the requirements for adjustment of status under sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act will
continue to pay only the standard filing fee (currently $130.00 or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age). Section 245(i)
of the Act also exempts certain persons applying under the new provision from payment of the additional sum. An unmarried
child who is less than 17 years of age when he or she applies for adjustment of status will be required to pay only the standard
filing fee (currently $130.00, or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age). The spouse of a legalized alien or the unmarried
child under 21 years of age of a legalized alien will also be required to pay only the standard filing fee (currently
$130.00, or $100.00 if less than 14 years of age), if the spouse or child qualifies for and has applied for voluntary
departure under the family unity program established by section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This additional sum is a penalty dictated by section 245(i) of the Act; therefore, payment of the additional sum will
not be waived, except as directed in section 245(i) of the Act. Also, fee waivers may be granted under 8 CFR 103.7(c)
only if the applicant substantiates his or her inability to pay the prescribed fee. Since a person applying for adjustment
of status under section 245 of the Act is required to show financial resources or income establishing that he or she
is not likely to become a public charge in the United States, a person who can establish a basis for waiving payment of
the additional sum would be unlikely to be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act. The few adjustment
provisions that waive the public charge exclusion ground for a person seeking adjustment of status under section
245 of the Act also provide other waivers that eliminate any need for the applicant to seek the benefits of section 245(i)
of the Act.

Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Each person applying for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, including a child, must complete Form I&hyph;485.
Each applicant must also compile the initial evidence required by that form's instructions. Supplement A to Form
I&hyph;485 (Supplement A) may then be completed to determine whether the applicant must file under section 245(i)
of the Act and whether the additional sum must be paid. This supplementary form asks several questions and provides
instructions that allow the applicant to decide whether he or she must submit Supplement A and whether an additional
sum must be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each person, including a child, whose eligibility for adjustment of status is based on the provisions of section 245(i)
of the Act must file Supplement A. The Form I&hyph;485 with fee and the Supplement A with any required additional sum
must be filed with the office having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.

Section 506(c) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317 states that ``(t)he provisions of these amendments to the Immigration and
Nationality Act shall take effect on October 1, 1994.'' These amendments to the Act are not retroactive and cannot
be applied to applications for adjustment of status filed before that date. They also cannot be applied to a motion
to reopen or reconsider an adjustment of status application if the underlying adjustment application was filed before
October 1, 1994. An intending immigrant is not, however, precluded from obtaining the benefits of the new law merely
because he or she previously sought to adjust status. If the person meets the requirements for adjustment of status
under the provisions of the new section 245(i) of the Act, he or she may file a new application for adjustment of status
with fee, accompanied by Supplement A and any required additional sum. The applicant must show that he or she has an
immigrant visa number immediately available and meets all other applicable requirements of section 245 of the Act
on the date the new application is filed.

Nationality Act shall *&blank;*&blank;* cease to have effect on October 1, 1997.'' Applications for adjustment
of status under section 245(i) of the Act cannot be granted on or after that date. Prospective adjustment of status
applicants who are seeking the benefits of section 245(i) of the Act must file their applications sufficiently in
advance of October 1, 1997, to ensure that they can be completed before that date. Application processing times vary
by location, and persons who will be seeking adjustment of status under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act
during 1997 are encouraged to file as early in the year as possible. Persons who must file after June 1997 should contact
the office having jurisdiction over their place of residence for further instructions.

Immediate Availability of Immigrant Visa Number
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
All applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act must have an immediately available immigrant
visa number. ``Immediately available'' for the purpose of accepting and processing the Form I&hyph;485 application
filed by a preference alien is defined in 8 CFR 245.1(f) as being not later than the date shown in the current Department
of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin. The Department of State, however, defines ``immediately available''
as being earlier than the date shown in the current Visa Bulletin. This rule amends 8 CFR 245.1(f) to bring the adjustment
of status provision into accordance with the Department of State's definition. It also changes the name of the Visa
Bulletin to reflect its current title.

New Restriction on Immigrant Visa Issuance Abroad
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Public Law 103&hyph;317 also places a new restriction on the issuance of immigrant visas abroad before October 1,
1997, which has no effect on persons seeking adjustment of status in the United States. Section 506(a) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317
adds a new section 212(o) to the Act, which forbids immigrant visa issuance to certain prospective immigrants, including
children, who have been physically present in the United States. Prospective immigrants, except certain spouses
and children of legalized aliens, who were not maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of departure from
the United States, will not be eligible for immigrant visa issuance within 90 days of departure from the United States.
This new restriction does not apply to the spouse of a legalized alien or the unmarried child under 21 years of age of
a legalized alien, if the spouse or child qualifies for and has applied for voluntary departure under the family unity
program established by section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. The new section 212(o) of the Act takes effect
on October 1, 1994, and ceases to have effect on October 1, 1997. The Department of State, which has jurisdiction over
immigrant visa issuance at United States consulates and embassies abroad, will promulgate regulations implementing
this provision of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317.

Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Crime bill), Pub. L. 103&hyph;322, was enacted on September
13, 1994. Section 130003 of the Crime Bill, entitled ``Alien Witness Cooperation and Counterterrorism Information''
adds a new section 245(i) to the Act. This provision restricts the adjustment of status of certain persons admitted
to the United States under a newly established ``S'' nonimmigrant classification. Congress clearly did not intend
to repeal or supersede the provisions of the Department of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103&hyph;317, by adding another section 245(i) to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. The Service regards the establishment of the second section 245(i) of the Act as a numbering error and will recommend
that Congress enact a technical amendment to redesignate the Crime Bill's provision as section 245(j) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment,
is based on the ``good cause'' exceptions found at 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3)(B), (d)(3); see

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early implementation will allow persons in the United States to apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent
resident as of the beginning of the statutorily established application period on October 1, 1994. These persons
had been ineligible to adjust status and had been obliged to incur the expense and inconvenience of applying for an
immigrant visa at a United States embassy or consulate abroad.

The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the following factors. By temporarily removing
certain restrictions on eligibility for adjustment of status, the rule will eliminate inconvenience to a number
of individuals currently in the United States who otherwise would have incurred significant monetary expenses by
traveling abroad to apply for an immigrant visa at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. It will have no effect
on small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations with regards to the admission
of certain nurses seeking nonimmigrant classification under the H&hyph;1A classification. This rule is necessary
because of a change in the method that the National Council of State Boards of Nursing employs in administering the
permanent state licensure examination (NCLEX). In response to this change in testing procedures, this rule provides
that nurses entering the United States on the basis of a temporary license issued by the state of intended employment
must pass the NCLEX within six months after the date of their initial admission to the United States. The rule also clarifies
for businesses and the general public the requirements for the admission of foreign nurses into the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 212(m)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) describes the qualifications necessary for an alien
to obtain classification as an H&hyph;1A registered nurse. The Act requires, among other things, that the nurse must
have either: (1) a full and unrestricted license to practice professional nursing in the state of intended employment
or (2) have passed an approximate examination (under current 8 CFR 214.2 (h)(3)(iii), the examination given by the
Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)) and have a temporary license for the state of intended
employment. Under the current regulations, a foreign nurse who is accorded H&hyph;1A status based on a temporary
license after passage of the CGFNS is required to sit and pass the first available permanent state licensing examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to April 1, 1994, the permanent state licensing examination was given twice a year, in February and July. Under
current 8 CFR 214.2(h)(3)(v)(B), a nurse admitted in H&hyph;1 classification based on passage of the CGFNS examination
and temporary licensure who fails the permanent state licensing examination or fails to sit for the first available
permanent licensing examination is no longer eligible for H&hyph;1A status. On April 1, 1994, however, the National
Council of State Boards of Nursing altered its testing procedures and now offers the permanent state licensing examination
on a walk-in basis, six days a week. Thus, the current regulatory requirement that the alien sit and pass the first available
state nursing examination is no longer appropriate since the test is now available to the nurse immediately upon entry
into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide a nurse with sufficient time to acclimate himself or herself to the country and to prepare for the
examination, the Service has determined that a nurse who has been accorded H&hyph;1A status on the basis of a temporary
license shall be granted a period of six months after the date of entry to sit and pass the permanent state licensing
examination. After passage of the permanent state licensing examination, the alien's employer must file an application
to extend the stay of the alien. At the time of the application for extension of stay, the alien's employer must demonstrate
that the alien has remained in H&hyph;1A status continuously from the time of his or her admission by submitting evidence
reflecting that the alien has been employed continuously as a registered professional nurse since entry. An alien
who does not pass the permanent state licensing examination with six months of his or her admission or fails to maintain
a valid H&hyph;1A status is not eligible for a further extension of stay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these changes, petitions for H&hyph;1A aliens entering the United States based on a temporary license will
continue to be approved for a period not to exceed one year. Further, an H&hyph;1A alien shall be admitted to the United
States for the validity of the supporting petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provisions for post-promulgation public comment,
is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Because of changes in the National Council
of State Boards of Nursing testing procedures, immediate implementation of the interim rule is necessary to ensure
foreign nurses admitted to the U.S. in H&hyph;1A status based on possession of temporary licenses an adequate and
realistic period of time to prepare for the permanent state licensing examination and therefore, continued eligibility
for H&hyph;1A classification.

The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulation merely modifies certain filing procedures
for petitions for foreign nurses to make them consistent with industry practices.

The regulation proposed herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of Government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have

. An extension of stay may be authorized for a period of up to two years for a beneficiary of an H&hyph;1A petition. The
alien's total period of stay may not exceed five years, except in extraordinary circumstances. An H&hyph;1A alien
who has been in the United States for a period of five years in such status may receive a one-year extension of stay if
it is established by the petitioner that extraordinary circumstances exist which warrant such an extension. Extraordinary
circumstances shall exist when the director finds that termination of the alien's services will impose extreme hardship
on the petitioner's business operation or that the alien's services are required in the national welfare, safety,
or security interests of the United States. Each request for an extension of stay for the beneficiary of an H&hyph;1A
petition must be accompanied by a current copy of the Department of Labor's notice of acceptance of the petitioner's
attestation on Form ETA 9029. A request for an extension of stay filed in behalf of an alien who initially entered the
United States on the basis of a temporary license must be accompanied by evidence that the alien has remained in a valid
H&hyph;1A status since his or her initial entry into the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that provided for payment at fair market value for whole
herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. This action is necessary to eliminate in an expeditious manner
all swine herds known to be affected with brucellosis, and to help ensure that swine brucellosis is eradicated in the
United States within the next 5 years. This action is also necessary to help eliminate the human health risk associated
with swine brucellosis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brucellosis is a serious infectious disease of swine, cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused
by bacteria of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Brucellosis in swine is characterized by abortion, infertility, orchitis, posterior paralysis, and lameness.
To help prevent the spread of the disease, and to further its eradication, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 provide for
payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity
is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive for promptly destroying animals infected with or exposed
to brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 govern the interstate movement of swine affected with brucellosis. To help prevent
the spread of the disease, under these regulations the interstate movement of brucellosis reactor swine and exposed
swine is subject to certain restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an interim rule effective and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12530&hyph;12533, Docket No. 94&hyph;007&hyph;1), we amended the regulations in part 51
to provide for payment at fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis. We also amended
the regulations in part 78 to require that all brucellosis-exposed swine from herds known to be affected with the disease
be identified with an eartag before being moved interstate from the herd. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments on the interim rule for a 60-day comment period ending May 16, 1994. We received 13 comments by
that date. The commenters included a swine industry association and other members of the swine industry, a national
veterinary association, a Federal agency, a workers union, representatives of a county government, and other members
of the general public. Twelve of the commenters supported the interim rule as written. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposed the interim rule, on the grounds that the swine industry, not the Federal Government, should
take financial responsibility for swine destroyed because of brucellosis. We are making no changes based on this
comment. Under 21 U.S.C. 111, the Secretary of Agriculture has statutory authority to promulgate regulations to
prevent the dissemination from one State to another of contagious, infectious, or communicable diseases of animals.
Under 21 U.S.C. 114a, the Secretary is authorized to pay claims growing out of the destruction of animals affected
by or exposed to any communicable disease of livestock that threatens the U.S. livestock industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with this statutory authority, the regulations in part 51 provide for payment of Federal indemnity
to owners of swine destroyed because of brucellosis. As we discussed in our interim rule, under the provisions of that
rule, the total cost for indemnity is expected to increase only slightly over the life of the swine brucellosis eradication
program, and total swine brucellosis eradication costs are expected to decrease substantially. We expect that paying
fair market value for whole herds of swine depopulated because of brucellosis will reduce the total cost of eradication
from $18.6 million to $11.35 million, and will shorten the time necessary to achieve eradication by more than 25 years.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the interim rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the interim rule, without change, as a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also requires that all exposed swine in a herd known to be affected with brucellosis be identified with a metal
eartag before being moved interstate from the herd known to be affected. At present, 10 swine herds in the United States
are known to be affected with brucellosis. This number represents less than 0.005 percent of the 235,840 swine herds
in this country. We estimate that the cost of applying eartags to exposed swine in the average herd known to be affected
will be less than $20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T94&hyph;19&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes by individual telegrams.
This AD supersedes an existing airworthiness directive that currently requires a revision to the Airplane Flight
Manual (AFM) to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the Flight Management Computer
(FMC) under certain conditions. This amendment requires a revision to the AFM to ensure that the flight crews verify
the accuracy of data provided by the FMC under all conditions. This amendment is prompted by a report that the ``check/confirm
V speed'' message may be inhibited when the flaps are extended to within three degrees of the takeoff flap setting that
was entered into the FMC. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent FMC miscalculations that may result
in excessively high takeoff decision (V

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) speeds, which may adversely affect accelerate-stop distances and may lead to the failure of the airplane to stop
prior to departing the end of the runway during a high speed rejected takeoff. This amendment also revises the previously
issued telegraphic AD by correcting a typographical error in the listing of the part numbers for the FMC's.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 6, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94&hyph;08&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8879 (59 FR 17467, April 13, 1994), to require
revising the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to ensure that the flight crews verify the accuracy of data
provided by the Flight Management Computer (FMC) when the anti-ice system is turned on during flex (assumed) temperature
takeoffs. That AD does not require that these procedures be followed if the runway is dry, if the field length is balanced,
or if the ice protection is turned off. That action was prompted by a report that certain Honeywell FMC's provided erroneous
V speed data when the anti-ice system was turned on during flex temperature takeoffs. The FAA determined that this
phenomenon may occur on McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes equipped with Honeywell
FMC's having part numbers 4059050&hyph;906, &hyph;907, and &hyph;908. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in the airplane failing to achieve sufficient climb gradient, which may result in the airplane failing to achieve
obstacle clearance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report that the ``check/confirm V speed'' message may be inhibited
when the flaps are extended to within three degrees of the takeoff flap setting that was entered into the FMC. Under
normal operating conditions, the FMC calculates V speeds based on data the pilot enters into the FMC and data the FMC
receives from the aircraft sensors, including total air temperature (TAT). Investigation revealed that on hot sunny
days, the TAT probe may indicate an erroneously high ambient temperature that is up to 15 degrees Celsius higher than
the actual ambient temperature. The FMC, however, was supposedly designed and certified to account for this error
in the actual ambient temperature by continually recalculating the V speed data and indicating a ``check/confirm
V speed'' message when the calculations indicate that the V speeds differ by more than two knots from the V speeds entered
into the FMC by the pilot. However, if the flaps are set to the takeoff position prior to the TAT probe temperature reaching
the ambient temperature, that message would be inhibited and the pilot would not be notified that the indicated V speed
is incorrect. The FAA has determined that such erroneous indications may result in an FMC calculation of the takeoff
decision speed (V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that is up to six knots greater than the actual V

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 speeds could result in accelerate-stop distances that exceed planned takeoff distances, which may lead to the airplane
departing the end of the runway during a high speed rejected takeoff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and
MD&hyph;11F series airplanes of the same type design, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T94&hyph;19&hyph;51, on September
14, 1994, to supersede AD 94&hyph;08&hyph;07 and to require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to ensure that the flight
crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the FMC under all conditions. The AD also requires that V speeds be manually
entered into the FMC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer of these airplanes, in concert with the manufacturer of
the FMC, is currently developing new software that will address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this
software is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of telegraphic AD T94&hyph;19&hyph;51, the FAA discovered that a typographical
error appeared in the listing of affected part numbers for the Honeywell FMC's. The part numbers were inadvertently
listed as ``4059040&hyph;906, &hyph;907, and &hyph;908.'' The correct part numbers are ``4059050&hyph;906, &hyph;907,
and &hyph;908.'' (These correct part numbers were listed correctly in the preamble to the telegraphic AD and in the
previously-issued AD 94&hyph;08&hyph;07.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on September 14, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of McDonnell Douglas
Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published
in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an amendment to section 39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective to all persons.
Additionally, this AD revises the telegraphic AD by correcting a typographical error in the listing of FMC part numbers.

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;160&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 18, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;16&hyph;93) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 43827) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 1) under section 1363(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments responding to the notice were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No public hearing was requested or held. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of all the comments, the regulations proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by PS&hyph;16&hyph;93 are adopted as revised by this Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, a C corporation that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfers LIFO inventory to an S Corporation in a tax-free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reorganization is subject to the LIFO recapture rules of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1363(d) and must include the LIFO recapture amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its gross income in its last taxable year of existence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator asserted that the IRS appeared to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded its authority by extending the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1363(d) to situations in which an S corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
succeeds to LIFO inventory in a tax-free reorganization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS and the Treasury Department believe that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are a valid exercise of authority to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumvention of section 1363(d). Therefore, the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations retain the rule of the proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commentator noted that the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would apply to a transfer of LIFO inventory by a transferor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C corporation that goes out of existence in a tax-free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reorganization but would not apply to a transfer in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with a tax-free reorganization under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
368(a)(1)(D) in which the transferor corporation remains in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence. The commentator suggested revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to require inclusion of the LIFO recapture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount in the year of the transfer of the LIFO inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead of the transferor corporation's last year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence. The final regulations adopt this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations also clarify which corporation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility to pay the three succeeding installments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tax described in section 1363(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators suggested expanding the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to deal with various related issues that arise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from application of the LIFO recapture rules. The IRS and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Treasury Department believe that those issues are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately dealt with in other forms of administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance. Accordingly, these comments have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small business.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the
``Regulations''), to add new entries to appendices A and B. Appendix A, Organizations Determined to be Within the
Term ``Government of Libya'' (Specially Designated Nationals of Libya), is a list of organizations determined by
the Director of FAC to be within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya,'' as set forth in &sect;550.304(a)
of the Regulations, because they are owned or controlled by or act or purport to act directly or indirectly on behalf
of the Government of Libya. Appendix B, Individuals Determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government
of Libya, lists individuals determined by the Director of FAC to be acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly
on behalf of the Government of Libya, and thus to fall within the term ``Government of Libya'' in &sect;550.304(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of the designation of Arab Hellenic Bank, S.A., Lafitrade
Holdings BV, Sabtina Limited, Teknica Oil Services (Overseas) Limited, and Teknica (UK) Limited as Specially Designated
Nationals of Libya. In addition, the listing for The Libyan Arab Uganda Bank for Foreign Trade and Development is amended
to note the bank's new name, Tropical Africa Bank Limited. Finally, Jardine House, located at 6 Crutched Friars, London
EC3N 2HT, England, is identified as blocked property of the Government of Libya.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of ten individuals determined to be Specially Designated
Nationals of the Government of Libya: Dino Armani, Giampiero Armani, Dr. Najmeddine Abdalla Arifi, Dr. Nuri Abdalla
Berruien, Marcello Busenti, Dr. Mukhtar Ali El&hyph;Ageli, Bahjat Fadel El Amir, Mustapha Ali El&hyph;Khoja, Smeida
El&hyph;Hosh El Naili, and Hassan Senoussi Zughaid. Messrs. Dino and Giampiero Armani and Mr. Busenti are shareholders
in Oilinvest (Netherlands) B.V., previously identified as a Specially Designated National, and the remaining individuals
are officers or directors in other institutions named as Specially Designated Nationals in this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of Libya apply to the entities and individuals identified
in appendices A and B. All unlicensed transactions with such entities or persons, or transactions in property in which
they have an interest, are prohibited unless otherwise exempted or generally licensed in the Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determinations that persons fall within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya'' and are thus Specially
Designated Nationals of Libya are effective upon the date of determination by the Director of FAC, acting under authority
delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice is effective upon the date of publication or upon actual
notice, whichever is sooner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of Specially Designated Nationals in appendices A and B is a partial one, since FAC may not be aware of all agencies
and officers of the Government of Libya, or of all persons that might be owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of
the Government of Libya within the meaning of &sect;550.304(a). Therefore, one may not rely on the fact that a person
is not listed in appendix A or B as a Specially Designated National as evidence that it is not owned or controlled by,
or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the Government of Libya. The Treasury Department
regards it as incumbent upon all persons governed by the Regulations to take reasonable steps to ascertain for themselves
whether persons with whom they deal are owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act on behalf of, the Government
of Libya, or on behalf of other countries subject to blocking or transactional restrictions administered by FAC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1705, provides for civil penalties not
to exceed $10,000 for each violation of the Regulations. Criminal violations of the Regulations are punishable by
fines of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years per count, or both, for individuals and criminal fines of up
to $500,000 per count for organizations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50 U.S.C. 1705; 18 U.S.C. 3571.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA is approving the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana for the purpose
of meeting requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990 (amended Act), with regard to new source review
(NSR) in areas that have not attained the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This SIP revision was submitted
by the State to satisfy Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area NSR SIP for Indiana. The USEPA is
approving the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is
also removing references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter Counties
for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the proposed
rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA is proposing approval of and soliciting public comment on this requested SIP revision. If adverse comments
are received on this direct final rule, USEPA will withdraw this final rule and address the comments received in a final
rule on the related proposed rule which is being published in the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air quality planning requirements for nonattainment NSR are set out in part D of title I of the Act. The USEPA has
issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how USEPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions
submitted under part D, including those State submittals containing nonattainment area new source review (NSR)
SIP requirements [see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)]. Because USEPA is describing its
interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of part D advanced in this rule and the supporting rationale. In this final rule on the Indiana
nonattainment NSR SIP, USEPA is applying its interpretations taking into consideration the specific factual issues
presented.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's action on SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).

1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to USEPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted
by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

The USEPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further USEPA review and action
(see section 110(k)(1) of the Act and 57 FR 13565). The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out
at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The USEPA attempts to make completeness
determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of
law under section 110(b)(1)(B) if a completeness determination is not made by USEPA within 6 months after receipt
of the submission.

The State of Indiana held public hearings on March 22, March 25, and April 1, 1993, to entertain public comment on the
requested NSR SIP revision. Following the public hearings, the plan was adopted by the State on July 21, 1993, became
effective on December 12, 1993, and was submitted to USEPA on February 25, 1994, as a requested revision to the SIP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with
the completeness criteria referenced above. The submittal was found to be complete on April 8, 1994, and a letter dated
April 8, 1994, was forwarded to the Governor's designee for SIPs, Timothy J. Method, indicating the completeness
of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. In this action, USEPA approves the Indiana nonattainment
new source review SIP submittal, and invites public comment on the action. At this time USEPA is also approving the
recodified permit rules to replace those in the existing SIP which were approved as APC 19 at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24).
Since the time of this approval, Indiana has recodified its air pollution control rules into Title 326 of the Indiana
Administrative Code (326 IAC). As requested by the State on August 15, 1994, USEPA is approving the incorporation
of recodified rules into the SIP to replace those previously approved as part of APC 19. This action is intended to make
it easier for the public, the State and USEPA to precisely identify what provisions covering permits are part of the
SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory requirements for nonattainment new source review SIPs and permitting are found at sections 172 and
173 of the Act. The Act requires States to address a number of nonattainment NSR provisions in a SIP submittal to meet
the requirements of part D of title I of the Act. What follows is a summary of the requirements and how the Indiana submittal
addresses them. A more detailed analysis is contained in the Technical Support Document for this rule which is available
for inspection at the Region 5 address listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires States to submit the following nonattainment NSR provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Provisions to ensure that certain construction bans previously imposed in States pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(I)
are lifted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended Act repealed provisions formerly in section 110(a)(2)(I) which required construction bans in certain
nonattainment areas. A construction ban was imposed in Lake and Porter Counties pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(I).
With some exceptions not applicable here, the amended Act thus lifted such construction bans, including the ban in
Lake and Porter Counties. This final rule therefore revises the Code of Federal Regulations to remove references
to the construction ban formerly imposed in Lake and Porter Counties for failure to have an approvable ozone plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Provisions, pursuant to section 173(a)(1), to assure that calculations of emissions offsets are based on the same
emissions baseline used in the demonstration of reasonable further progress. 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(5) requires
emission offsets to result in reasonable further progress toward attainment of the NAAQS. Also, the definition of
emissions offsets baselines in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(b) is consistent with reasonable further progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(1), to allow offsets to be obtained in another nonattainment area if the
area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other nonattainment area contribute
to a NAAQS violation in the area in which the source would construct. Indiana has established this provision in 326
IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(1), that any emissions offsets obtained in conjunction with the issuance
of a permit to a new or modified source must be enforceable at the time of permit issuance and in effect by the time the
new or modified source commences operation. Indiana has established this provision in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(b)(8).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(1), to assure that emissions increases from new or modified sources are
offset by real reductions in actual emissions. Indiana has established this provision in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. A provision, pursuant to section 173(c)(2), to prevent emissions reductions otherwise required by the Act from
being credited for purposes of satisfying part D offset requirements. Indiana has established this provision in
326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(b)(9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. States must establish provisions, pursuant to sections 172(c)(4) and 173(a)(1)(B), that reflect changes in growth
allowances; specifically, (1) the elimination of existing growth allowances in any nonattainment area that received
a notice prior to the Amendments that the SIP was substantially inadequate or receives such a notice in the future;
and (2) the restriction of growth allowances to only those portions of nonattainment areas formally targeted as special
zones for economic development. Indiana does not have any of the above mentioned growth allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. A provision, pursuant to section 173(a)(5), that requires an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production
processes, and environmental control techniques for proposed sources. This analysis shall demonstrate that the
benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of
its location, construction, or modification. This shall be a prerequisite to issuing any part D permit. Indiana has
established this provision in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. In accordance with section 173(d), Indiana has committed to report determinations, from nonattainment new source
review permits, to the RACT/BACT/LAER clearinghouse in the annual Indiana Department of Environmental Management
Air Management Program Workplan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. A provision, pursuant to section 173(e), that allows any existing or modified source that tests rocket engines
or motors to use alternative or innovative means to offset emissions increases from firing and related cleaning,
if four conditions are met: (a) the proposed modification is for expansion of a facility already permitted for such
purposes, (b) the source has used all available offsets and all reasonable means to obtain offsets and sufficient
offsets are not available, (c) the testing is essential to national security, and (d) the source will comply with an
alternative measure designed to offset any emissions increases not directly offset by the source. Indiana has established
this provision in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(b)(11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Provisions pursuant to section 819 of the Act that effectively exempt activities related to stripper wells from
the new additional NSR requirements of new subparts 2, 3, and 4 for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter
less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10), ozone, or carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas classified
as serious or less and having a population of less than 350,000. Indiana has not established such provisions. This
is acceptable because there are no stripper well activities in the State of Indiana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. Provisions, pursuant to section 328, to assure that sources located on an outer continental shelf (OCS) and within
25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, are subject to the same requirements applicable if the source were located
in the corresponding onshore area. Indiana has not established such provisions. This is acceptable because Indiana
is inland and not located on an OCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. Pursuant to sections 302(z) and 111(a)(3), a definition of ``stationary source'' to include internal combustion
engines other than the newly defined category of ``nonroad engines.'' Indiana has established a definition consistent
with these requirements in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(aa). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n. Pursuant to section 415, exemptions from nonattainment NSR provisions for installation, operation, cessation,
or removal of a qualifying temporary clean coal technology demonstration project. Such projects must still comply
with any applicable SIP and all other requirements for the attainment and maintenance of NAAQS. Indiana has established
this provision in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;2(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o. A provision, pursuant to section 173(a)(3), to assure that owners or operators of each proposed new or modified
major stationary source demonstrate, as a condition of permit issuance, the compliance of all other major stationary
sources under the same ownership in the State. Indiana has established this provision in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 172(c)(5), SIPs must require permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major
stationary sources. The statutory permit requirements for ozone nonattainment areas are generally contained in
revised section 173, and in subpart 2 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable
implementation plan. For all classifications of ozone nonattainment areas and for ozone transport regions, States
must adopt the appropriate major source thresholds and offset ratios. States must also adopt provisions to ensure
that any new or modified major stationary source of nitrogen oxides (NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Indiana does not have an extreme ozone nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Indiana's plan submittal reflects appropriate modification provisions in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(j),
including a de minimis level of 25 tons for serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas. 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(j)
sets the major modification threshold level (``deminimis level'') at 25 tons per year (tpy) when the net emissions
increase from the proposed modification is aggregated with all other net emissions increases from the source over
a 5 consecutive calendar year period prior to, and including, the year of the modification. This meets the requirements
of section 182(c)(6). The registration requirement exemption levels of 15 pounds per day of VOC and 25 pounds per day
of NO

 (326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(2)(B)) are for the purposes of determining applicability of the registration requirements
for new sources and modifications to existing sources. These exemption levels do not exclude smaller emissions increases
from being counted in the 5 year aggregated net emissions increase analyses required in serious and severe ozone nonattainment
areas.

The statutory permit requirements for CO nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section 173, and
in subpart 3 of part D. These are the minimum requirements that States must include in an approvable implementation
plan. States must adopt the appropriate major source threshold and offset ratio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indiana has established a major source threshold of 100 tpy (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1(q)(1)) and an offset ratio
of 1 to 1 (in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;3(a)(5)(A)) for moderate CO nonattainment areas. Indiana does not have a serious

The statutory permit requirements for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are generally contained in revised section

plan. For both classifications of PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, States must adopt the appropriate major source
threshold, offset ratio, significance level for modifications, and provisions for PM&hyph;10 precursors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Indiana does not have a serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area. Also, Indiana is not required to count PM&hyph;10
precursors towards PM&hyph;10 emissions. Filter analysis data from ambient monitors in Cook County, Illinois (the
data was collected in 1992) were used to asses the significance of PM precursors in the Lake County, Indiana PM nonattainment
area. The monitors used are located at the Washington School and the Bright School in the city of Chicago, Illinois.
These monitors are located approximately .6 and 1.75 miles, respectively, west the Lake County nonattainment area.
Besides the close proximity, these sites are also appropriate because the source mix in southeast Chicago closely
approximates that of the Lake County nonattainment area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mean sulfate concentration plus the mean nitrate concentration for the Washington school and Bright school monitors
were 13.1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 respectively. This compares to an average annual background PM concentration of 23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 in the Lake County nonattainment area. This illustrates the relative insignificance of the impact of PM precursors,
and supports representing PM precursor impacts as part of the background concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further considerations also argue against applying the same control requirements for precursor sources as for direct
emission sources. The climatology in northwest Indiana is such that precursor emission control for a particular
source would not have a significant effect until far downwind. In considering the reductions to be achieved by controlling
PM precursors under section 189(e) Congress has indicated that USEPA should take into account reductions achievable
from control requirements imposed by other sections or titles of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Title IV of the Clean Air Act
mandates significant particulate precursor emission reductions in Indiana, after which the impacts of these sources
on particulate matter concentrations will be even less significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, it is appropriate to conclude that precursors do not contribute significantly to particulate
matter concentrations in the Lake County nonattainment area. This finding is based on the current character of the
area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth
could change the significance of precursors in the area. The USEPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such
potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.

The Indiana nonattainment rules have exemption levels listed in 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(2). 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(2)
states that a new source or a modification to an existing source with emissions above these exemption levels and below
potential emissions of 25 tons per year for any regulated pollutant shall be registered according to 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;2.
Also, 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1(b)(1) establishes exemption levels for requiring new sources or modifications to
existing sources obtain a construction permit under 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;3. The exemption levels are available
to sources for registration applicability purposes. These levels are applied before any netting calculations.
Sources cannot net emissions increases and decreases and then use net emissions in the exemption test. These do not
affect the provisions for special modifications.

The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela
Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the
definition of federally enforceable. The letter states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1,
should be interpreted in accordance with the Federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA, therefore,
interprets `federally enforceable' as used in the Indiana rules to be defined according to the Federal definition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The previous regulations approved into the Indiana SIP establishing a new source review program were contained in
APC&hyph;19 and codified at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). These regulations provided for a new source review program pursuant
to 40 CFR part 51 subpart I, including both minor and major new source review. USEPA is approving Indiana's SIP revisions
not only to adopt the changes referenced elsewhere in this notice but also to recodify the previously approved new
source review rules, formerly in APC&hyph;19 and currently in 326 IAC 2, based on a review of the entire submission,
USEPA has determined that the new source review regulations contained in 326 IAC 2 submitted by the state, including
both the rule changes and the recodification, meet the requirements of part D of title I of the Act. In addition, these
rules are being approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51 Subpart I, for both major and non-major new source review except not for
PSD requirements in 40 CFR 51.166.

11. Plantwide Source Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 14, 1981, the USEPA revised the new source review regulations in 40 CFR Part 51 to give states the option of
adopting the ``plantwide'' definition of stationary source which provides that only physical or operational changes
that result in a net increase in emissions at the entire plant require a NSR permit. For example, if a plant decreased
emissions by the same amount at another piece of process equipment, then there would be no net increase in emissions
at the plant and therefore, no ``modification'' to the ``source.'' The plantwide definition is in contrast to the
so-called ``dual'' definition [or definition of structure like that in the 1979 offset ruling (44 FR 3274), which
has much the same effect as the dual definition]. Under the dual definition, the emissions from each physical or operational
change are gauged without regard to reductions elsewhere at the plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the October 1981 rule, USEPA set forth its rationale for allowing use of the plantwide definition (46 FR 50766&hyph;69).
In its view, allowing use of the plantwide definition was a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting goals of part
D of title I of the Act. The Act provided for reasonable further progress (RFP) and timely attainment of National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), while also allowing for maximum state flexibility and economic growth. The USEPA
recognized that the plantwide definition would bring fewer plant modifications into the nonattainment permitting
process, but emphasized that this generally would not interfere with RFP and timely attainment primarily because
the states under the demands of Part D eventually would have adequate SIPs in place. For instance, USEPA stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS continues to be required, deletion of the dual definition
increases State flexibility without interfering with timely attainment of the ambient standards and so is consistent
with Part D [46 FR 50767]. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA also indicated that under the plantwide definition, new equipment would still be subjected to any applicable
new source performance standard and that wholly new plants, as well as any modifications that resulted in a significant
net emissions increase, would still be subject to NSR. Thus, EPA saw no significant disadvantage in the plantwide
definition from the environmental standpoint, but the advantages from the standpoints of state flexibility and
economic growth. It regarded the plantwide definition as presenting, at the very worst, environmental risks that
were manageable because of the independent impetus to create adequate Part D plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, EPA ruled that a state wishing to adopt a plantwide definition generally has complete discretion to do
so, and it set only one restriction on that discretion. If a state had specifically projected emission reductions
from its NSR program as a result of a dual or similar definition and had relied on those reductions in an attainment strategy
that USEPA later approved, then the state needed to revise its attainment strategy as necessary to accommodate reduced
NSR permitting under the plantwide definition (46 FR 50767 and 50769). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld USEPA's action as a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting purposes of Part
D of Title I of the Act, and hence, well within USEPA's broad discretion.

, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984). Specifically, the Court agreed that the plantwide definition is fully consistent with the
Act's goal of maximizing state flexibility and allowing reasonable economic growth. Likewise, the Court recognized
that USEPA had advanced a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the plantwide definition serves the Act's
environmental objectives as well (see 104 S.Ct. at 2792). In this rule USEPA generally reaffirms the rationales stated
in the 1981 rulemaking. Those rationales were left undisturbed by the Supreme Court decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SIP revision USEPA is approving in this action substitutes a plantwide definition for a dual definition in Indiana's
existing nonattainment NSR program. In obtaining USEPA approval of its original part D SIP, Indiana did not rely on
any emission reductions from the operation of its existing NSR program. Also, Indiana uses a plantwide definition
of source. A July 22, 1987 letter from Timothy J. Method, then Acting Assistant Commissioner, Office of Air Management,
Steve Rothblatt then Chief of the Air and Radiation Branch, states Indiana's rationale for implementing the plantwide
definition. The letter further states that in obtaining USEPA approval of its original part D SIP, Indiana did not
rely on emission reductions from its existing NSR program. Indiana has nonattainment areas for sulfur dioxide, lead,
ozone, and fine particulate matter. Indiana has submitted several revisions required by the amended Act prior to
attainment of the NAAQS by the statutory attainment dates, which range from 1994 to 2007 for the nonattainment areas
in Indiana. For example, Indiana has submitted revisions for VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT, Stage II vapor recovery, clean fuel fleets, and 15% VOC reduction, employee commute options vehicle inspection
and maintenance and the 1990 base year ozone emissions inventory. These revisions have been or will be acted on by USEPA
in subsequent actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indiana's plantwide definition of source is consistent with the NSR requirements for ozone nonattainment areas
in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Lake and Porter Counties are classified as a ``severe'' ozone nonattainment
area. Therefore, the attainment date for the area is now 2007 (see section 181(a)), and Indiana must meet an independent
requirement to reduce VOC emissions by fifteen percent in the first six years after 1990 and three percent per year
thereafter (see section 182(b)(1) and (c)(2)(B)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Indiana must account for the impact of its plantwide definition of source in the attainment and reasonable further
progress demonstrations it submits under the amended Act, it is clear that Congress anticipated States could use
the plantwide definition of source when devising such plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended Act includes provisions regulating the application of the plantwide definition of source, including
a special rule for serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas for determining ``de minimis'' net increases in VOC
emissions from source modifications (section 182(c)(6)). It is clear that Congress anticipates states will often
continue to employ USEPA's plantwide definition of source in ozone nonattainment areas (except in extreme areas,
see section 182(e)(2)), provided the states can also meet the new reasonable further progress requirements in the
Act. In addition, it is important to note that the 1990 Amendments' adoption of new future attainment deadlines has
mooted concerns regarding the approvability of a plantwide source definition where a state has missed prior attainment
deadlines. Congress has given Indiana additional time to submit a revised SIP to provide for attainment by the revised
deadlines. As described above, Indiana has already begun to meet its obligations under the 1990 Amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA expects to publish a proposed rule in late 1994 to implement the changes under the amended Act in the NSR provisions
in parts C and D of title I of the Act. USEPA may refer to the proposed rule as the most authoritative guidance available
regarding the approvability of the NSR SIP submittals. USEPA expects to take final action to promulgate a rule to implement
the parts C and D changes sometime during 1995. At that time, USEPA will review the NSR SIPs of all states to determine
whether further SIP revisions are necessary. Prior to USEPA approval of a State's NSR SIP submission, the State may
continue permitting only in accordance with the new statutory requirements for permit applications completed after
the relevant SIP submittal date (e.g. November 15, 1992 for ozone nonattainment areas). This policy was explained
in transition guidance memoranda from John Seitz dated March 11, 1991 and September 3, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the March 11 memorandum, USEPA does not believe Congress intended to mandate the more stringent Title
I NSR requirements during the time provided for SIP development. States were thus allowed to continue to permit consistent
with requirements in their current NSR SIPs during that period, or apply 40 CFR part 51, appendix S for newly designated
areas that did not previously have NSR SIP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The September 3 memorandum also addressed the situation where States did not submit the part D NSR SIP requirements
or revisions by the applicable statutory deadline. For permit applications complete by the SIP submittal deadline,
States may issue final permits under the prior NSR rules, assuming certain conditions in the September 3 memorandum
are met. However, for applications completed after the SIP submittal deadline, USEPA will consider the source to
be in compliance with the Act only where the source obtains a permit that is consistent with the substantive new NSR
part D provisions in the amended Act from the State. USEPA believes this guidance continues to apply to permitting
pending final action on NSR SIP submittals.

Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's action on SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;66).

1. The USEPA is approving the requested SIP revision submitted on March 7, 1994. The submittal consists of Title 326
IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1, 2&hyph;1&hyph;2, 2&hyph;1&hyph;3, 2&hyph;3&hyph;1, 2&hyph;3&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3&hyph;3,
and 2&hyph;3&hyph;5. The State of Indiana has submitted a complete plan to implement the new source review provisions
of part D. Each of the program elements mentioned above was properly addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The USEPA is also approving the recodified permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP which were approved
as APC 19 at 40 CFR 52.770(c)(24). The incorporation of the recodified version of these Indiana rules into the SIP will
make it easier for the public, the State and USEPA to identify precisely what permitting provisions are part of the
SIP. Some confusion surrounding what State rules were part of the permitting SIP has existed since Indiana recodified
its APC rules into the Title 325 of the Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) and subsequently into Title 326 IAC. After
the effective date of this final rule all of Indiana's permitting SIP rules will be contained in Title 326 of the IAC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Consistent with section 110(n)(3) of the amended Act the USEPA is taking this opportunity to remove references
in 52.773(i) and 52.777(d) to the sanctions formerly imposed on Lake and Porter Counties which were lifted by the 1990
Act amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because USEPA considers these actions to be noncontroversial and routine, we are approving them without prior proposal.
This action will become effective on December 6, 1994. However, if we receive adverse comments on these actions by
November 7, 1994, then USEPA will publish a final rule that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received
in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of
this

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

(94) On February 25, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) in the form of amendments
to Title 326: Air Pollution Control Board of the Indiana Administrative Code (326 IAC) 2&hyph;1&hyph;1 and 2&hyph;1&hyph;3
which were intended to satisfy the additional new source review requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
The USEPA, at this time, is also approving the incorporation of permitting rules recodified as Article 2. Permit Review

(d) Part D_Disapproval. The 1982 Indiana plan for Lake and Porter County is disapproved because it does not assure
the attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS there. See &sect;&sect;52.770(c)(69) and 52.773(i). The disapproval
does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain
approved.

(h) On March 7, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for New Source Review (NSR)
to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include
a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana,
sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter
states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1, should be interpreted in accordance
with the federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA took the opportunity of rulemaking on the State's
submittal to recodify the permitting SIP to conform to Title 326 the Indiana Administrative Code.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 19, 1993, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 published the Environmental Protection Agency's (the Agency's) rulemaking requiring on-board emission diagnostics
systems on 1994 and later model year light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks (58 FR 9468). This rulemaking promulgated
regulations that included provisions requiring vehicle manufacturers to install on affected vehicles:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;features to deter modification except as authorized by the manufacturer. Any reprogrammable
computer codes or operating parameters must be resistant to tampering and the computer and any related maintenance
instructions must conform to the provisions of SAE J2186 ``E/E Data Link Security.'' (SEP91). A removable calibration
memory chip shall be potted or encased in a sealed container&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*. Demonstration of compliance
with the tampering protection section of the California OBD II requirements shall satisfy the requirements of this
section through the 1998 model year.'' 40 CFR &sect;86.094&hyph;18 (the ``anti-tampering regulation''.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several associations representing aftermarket automotive parts manufacturers, rebuilders, distributors, retailers
and automotive service and repair providers (``the petitioners'') subsequently petitioned for review of the rulemaking
by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Docket No. 93&hyph;1277). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 9, 1994, the Agency and the petitioners (``the parties'') filed with the Court a Joint Motion to Remand the Administrative
Record to the Agency ``in order for EPA to reconsider the anti-tampering provisions, to address any tensions between
these provisions and the access and information availability requirements [of sections 202(m)(4) and 202(m)(5)
of the Act], and, if necessary, to promulgate new regulations addressing EPA's concerns about tampering.'' The parties
further requested the Court to order that the anti-tampering provisions (and the incorporation of California's
anti-tampering regulations) be vacated and be declared void 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ab initio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 19, 1994, the Court ordered that the joint motion for remand be granted and that the anti-tampering regulation
be vacated. The Court also ordered that 40 CFR &sect;86.094&hyph;17(j) be vacated to the extent it requires compliance
with California's anti-tampering regulations for those vehicles optionally certified to the California OBD II
requirements (Title 13, California Code of Regulations, &sect;1968.1(d)). The Court also ordered the remainder
of the case be held in abeyance pending further order of the Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to issue a final rulemaking that will officially withdraw the anti-tampering provisions (40 CFR &sect;86.094&hyph;18
and 40 CFR &sect;86.094&hyph;17(j), to the extent it requires compliance with California's anti-tampering regulations
for those vehicles optionally certified to the California OBD II requirements) from the Code of Federal Regulations.
In addition, EPA is continuing to review its policy concerns regarding tampering, (i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 modifications made to vehicles in order to, or resulting in, the vehicles' emission control systems being incapacitated,
damaged, or made less effective.) EPA may in the future determine that it is appropriate to promulgate new regulations
to address its concerns regarding tampering. If the Agency so determines, it will at that time publish a notice of proposed
rulemaking addressing these concerns.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous
waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain
other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in
40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270.

B. Arkansas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Arkansas initially received final authorization on January 25, 1985, (see 50 FR 1513) to implement its base hazardous
waste management program. Arkansas received authorization for revisions to its program on August 23, 1985, May 29,
1990 (see 55 FR 11192), November 18, 1991 (see 56 FR 57593 and 56 FR 47153), and December 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45721 and 57
FR 45722). The authorized Arkansas RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations
effective December 13, 1993 (see 58 FR 52674). On June 9, 1994, Arkansas submitted a final complete program revision
application for additional program approvals. Today, Arkansas is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance
with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed the State of Arkansas's application, and decided that Arkansas's hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant
final authorization for Arkansas's additional program modifications. The public may submit written comments on
EPA's final decision until November 21, 1994. Copies of Arkansas's application for program revision are available
for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the

Approval of Arkansas's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless
an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's application discussed in this notice is received by the end of
the comments period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate
final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arkansas's program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated
in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 262, 264, 265, 266, 268, and 270 that were
published in the FR through June 30, 1992. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart
below. This chart lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.

C. Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that the Arkansas application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Arkansas is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. Arkansas now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within
its borders and carrying out the the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject
to the limitations of the HSWA. Arkansas also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the
right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013,
and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA uses part 272 for codification of the decision to authorize Arkansas's program and for incorporation by reference
of those provisions of Arkansas's statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003
of RCRA. Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of part 272, subpart E until a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Arkansas's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This
rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 The State of Oklahoma has applied for Final authorization of revision to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Oklahoma's application
and decided that its hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for
final authorization. Unless adverse written comments are received during the review and comment period provided
for public participation in this process, EPA intends to approve Oklahoma's hazardous waste program revision subject
to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Oklahoma's application
for the program revision is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous
waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain
other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in
40 CFR 124, 260 through 268, and 270.

B. Oklahoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Oklahoma initially received Final Authorization on January 10, 1985, (see 49 FR 50362) to implement its base hazardous
waste management program. Oklahoma received authorization for revisions to its program on June 18, 1990 (see 55 FR
14280), November 27, 1990 (see 55 FR 39274), June 3, 1991 (see 56 FR 13411), and November 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 47675). The
authorized Oklahoma RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations effective December
13, 1993. On August 3, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program
approvals. Today, Oklahoma is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with &sect;271.21(b)(3).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statutory authority is provided by the Oklahoma Hazardous Waste Management Act, as amended, 27A Oklahoma Statute
(O.S.) Supplement 1993, &sect;&sect;2&hyph;7&hyph;101 et seq. The Act was amended May 28, 1993, and is expected
to be amended this legislative session by Senate Bills 832 and 997. Pursuant to this Act, the Oklahoma Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) adopted by reference the Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management, Oklahoma
Department of Health (ODH) Bulletin 0525, as amended on October 5, 1992. The Environmental Quality Board adopted
these rules by reference and without amendment, under the emergency rulemaking procedures of the Administrative
Procedures Act, 75 O. S. Supp. 1992 &sect;&sect;250 et seq. The Governor signed the emergency rulemaking action with
an effective date of July 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 24, 1993, the Environmental Quality Board adopted permanent rules, Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC)
Title 252 Chapter 200 (Rules) with an effective date of May 26, 1994. The Rules are a slightly modified version of the
former rules which were adopted by reference from ODH Bulletin 0525. Modifications include changing references
of Oklahoma State Department of Health to the Department of Environmental Quality, Commissioner of Health to Executive
Director, 310:270 to 252:200, and references of former statutory authority to present statutory authority. Substantive
changes are found in former OAC 310:270&hyph;11&hyph;2 ``County Commissioner Involvement In Permit Issuance'',
Tables 1, 2, and 3.B, dealing with fees, and Subchapter 17, which addresses tax credits.

EPA reviewed DEQ's application, and made an immediate final decision that DEQ's hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for Final Authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant
Final Authorization for the additional program modifications to Oklahoma. The public may submit written comments
on EPA's final decision until November 21, 1994. Copies of Oklahoma's application for program revision are available
for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the

 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of DEQ's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless an
adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment
period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final
decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oklahoma's program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated
in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 262, 264, 265, 266 and 270 that were published
in the FR through June 30, 1992. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart below.
This chart also lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.

C. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that DEQ's application for a program revision meets the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, DEQ is granted Final Authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Oklahoma
now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and for carrying
out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the
HSWA. Oklahoma also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA uses 40 CFR part 272 for codification of the decision to authorize DEQ's program and for incorporation by reference
of those provisions of its Statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.
Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of 40 CFR part 272, subpart LL until a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Oklahoma's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This
rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous
waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain
other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in
40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Mexico received final authorization January 25, 1985, (see 50 FR 1515) to implement its base hazardous waste management
program. New Mexico received authorization for revisions to its program on April 10, 1990 (see 55 FR 4604), July 25,
1990 (see 55 FR 28397), December 4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45717) and August 23, 1994. The authorized New Mexico RCRA program
was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), effective December 13, 1993 (see 58 FR 52677).
On July 26, 1994, New Mexico submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals.
Today, New Mexico is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3).

EPA reviewed New Mexico's application, and made an immediate final decision that New Mexico's hazardous waste program
revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to New Mexico. The public may submit written
comments on EPA's final decision until November 21, 1994. Copies of New Mexico's application for program revision
are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of New Mexico's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless
an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the
comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate
final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Mexico's program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated
in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;262, 264, 265, 266 and 270 that were published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Mexico is not authorized to operate the Federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA.

C. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that New Mexico's application for a program revision meets the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, New Mexico is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. New Mexico now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within
its borders and for carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject
to the limitations of the HSWA. New Mexico also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the
right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013
and 7003 of RCRA.

D. Codification in Part 272 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA uses 40 CFR part 272 for codification of the decision to authorize New Mexico's program and for incorporation by
reference of those provisions of New Mexico's Statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under sections 3008,
3013, and 7003 of RCRA. Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of 40 CFR part 272, subpart GG until a later date.

Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of New Mexico's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities.
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule establishes, for fiscal years 1994 and beyond, a minimum level of funding for grants made to States, Commonwealths,
and Territories to provide individuals eligible to receive benefits under the Medicare program with information,
counseling, and assistance related to obtaining adequate and appropriate health insurance coverage. It also sets
forth the following in regulations: A description of the methodology used to determine the total amount of the grant
award; the conditions for eligibility for the grant; limitations on the use of grant funds in certain circumstances;
reporting requirements; and an opportunity to appeal our determination regarding a State's grant application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this rule are in accordance with section 4360 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule eliminates the supplemental coordinated care grants program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4360 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, and applicable
appropriations authorize us to make grants to States, Commonwealths, and Territories for health insurance advisory
service programs for Medicare beneficiaries. (Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, the term ``State'' or
``States'' includes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American
Samoa.) Grant funds are available to support providing information, counseling, and assistance (ICA) relating
to Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare supplemental policies, long-term care insurance, and other health insurance benefit
information. Thus, this funding activity is known as the Health Insurance ICA Grants Program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4360(a) of OBRA '90 specifies that, in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be eligible for a grant under this program, the State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a Federally-approved Medicare supplemental regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program under section 1882 of the Social Security Act (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act) (42 USC 1395ss). Section 1882 addresses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of Medicare supplemental health insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies. In general, section 1882(b) provides that, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State establishes, under State law, a regulatory program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that applies the standards and requirements that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would apply to Medicare supplemental health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance policies under section 1882(c) and that meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain other criteria, those Medicare supplemental policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by the State are deemed to meet the standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that the Secretary would, herself, apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in order to be eligible for an ICA grant a State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate a regulatory program that we determine meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria of section 1882(b) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4360(b) of OBRA '90 specifies that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitting an application for an ICA grant, the State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a plan for a State-wide ICA program. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies the minimum information that the program must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide to Medicare beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant funding is available to States for projects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan, implement, operate, and/or enhance a variety of ICA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. States may request grant funds to develop new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health insurance ICA programs or to enhance existing health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance ICA programs that meet the requirements specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 4360 of OBRA '90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4360(a) requires us to publish regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a minimum level of funding for a health insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICA grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subject to congressional appropriations, in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements of section 4360 of OBRA '90, we will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announce the availability of funding for health insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICA grants. Solicitation and grant application packages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be mailed to the Governor (or his or her designee) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each eligible State. The closing date for receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications will be approximately 60 days thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Awards for health insurance ICA grants will be made before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1 of the year in which the solicitation is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICA grants will be administered in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of: 42 CFR part 403, subpart E; 45 CFR part 74, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(which concerns administration of grants) as specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;74.4(a)(2); 45 CFR part 92 (which concerns uniform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative requirements for grants and cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements to State and local governments); the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicitation; and the terms of the notice of grant award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Provisions of this Final Rule With Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 26, 1992, we published an interim final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with comment period (57 FR 38616) that established a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of funding for health insurance ICA grants made for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Those provisions are contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 42 CFR part 403, subpart E. In general, this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amends those provisions in order to establish a basis in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for continuation funding beyond FY 1993. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also eliminates the program of supplemental coordinated care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants. The provisions of this final rule with comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Eligibility for Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Based on sections 4360 (a) and (b) of OBRA '90, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule specifies, in &sect;403.501, that, in order to be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a health insurance ICA grant, the State must_

&bull;Have a Federally-approved Medicare supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory program under section 1882 of the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Submit a timely application to us that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of section 4360 of OBRA '90; 42 CFR part 403, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart E; and our solicitation for grant applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Availability and Duration of Funds for Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule specifies, at &sect;403.502, that grants for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal period will be approved subject to congressional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriation of funds and, if applicable, satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress in each State's project under a preceding health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance ICA grant. (The criteria by which progress will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated and the performance standards for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether satisfactory progress has been made will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the notice of grant award sent to each State.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that we may, at our discretion, set aside a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriated funds to be used for ICA-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. The grant award is based on a 12-month period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is made by the close of a fiscal year for each State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application approved by that date. However, information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the timing of the award and its duration will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the notice of grant solicitation, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Number and Size of Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule revises the provisions at existing &sect;403.504. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We continue to provide, at &sect;403.504(a) for two types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants: (1) New program grants, and (2) existing program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhancement grants for States with ``substantially similar'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health insurance ICA programs. We are interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing or enhancing health insurance ICA programs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all eligible States. Therefore, under &sect;403.504(b), each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible State that submits an acceptable application will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive a grant that consists of two parts: a fixed amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the minimum funding level) and a variable amount. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;403.504(b), the grant available to each of the 50 States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia equals $75,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the fixed amount), plus a per capita payment per resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare beneficiary. Because of their relatively small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations, the grant available to the Virgin Islands, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guam, and American Samoa is $25,000 each (the fixed amount), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plus a per capita payment per Medicare beneficiary residing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the territory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of the fixed amount portion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant award as the minimum funding level is a change from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum funding level described at existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;403.504(b). (Existing &sect;403.504(b), which was applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, provided that the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding level consisted of two parts: a basic (fixed) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion and a variable portion.) We believe it is clearer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(more descriptive) to establish as the minimum funding level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a fixed, stated dollar amount and to consider the variable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount as being in addition to the minimum funding level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change will not affect the amount of the grant award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grant award will still consist of the fixed portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount and the variable portion amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculation of the variable portion of the grant is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described at existing &sect;403.405(c). We base the variable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the grant on the amount of available funds and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison of each State with the average of all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States except the State being compared with respect to three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors that relate to the size of the State's Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and where that population resides. The three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors are: the percentage of nationwide Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries residing in the State, the State's proportion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Medicare beneficiaries to its total population, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiary population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that resides in rural areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nationally, the average variable payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10.75 cents. A State with a higher than average proportion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Medicare beneficiaries to its total State population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or a higher than average proportion of rural Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries will receive variable funds greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10.75 cents per beneficiary under this grant program. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total variable portion of the award, approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75 percent is based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the State; approximately 10 percent is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportion of Medicare beneficiaries to the total State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population; and approximately 15 percent is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the State's Medicare beneficiary population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that resides in rural areas. (We based population estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the U.S. Census estimates for 1990. The Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary estimates came from our beneficiary enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
database as of July 1990. We consider ``rural areas'' to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counties located outside of metropolitan statistical areas.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time we announce the availability of grant funding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we provide each State with an estimate of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds that may be awarded to it. As part of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, the State submits a budget based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated amount. When the grant awards are made, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocate all available monies based on the methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above. If the grant amount the State receives is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different than the anticipated amount on which its budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was based, the State must submit, along with its acceptance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the grant award, a revised budget that is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the award.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
It has come to our attention that the provisions at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing &sect;403.504, particularly paragraph (d) of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, have caused confusion because they do not clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the above process. (Some interpreted paragraph (d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as indicating that there was a two-step process involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for the grants. That is, that a State applied for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and was awarded a basic grant and that, if there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional funds available, the State submitted another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and a subsequent award was made.) This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revises &sect;403.504 to more clearly reflect the award process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
D. Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with section 4360(c) of OBRA '90, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule retains existing &sect;&sect;403.508 (a) and (b), with editorial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide that a State that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a grant under this program may, with one exception, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the grant for any expenses incurred in planning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing, implementing, and/or operating the program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the grant is made. The exception applies to a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that receives a grant to supplement an existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantially similar'' program. In this case, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must not use the grant to supplant funds for activities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were conducted immediately preceding the date of the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award of the grant and funded through other sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including in-kind contributions), but must maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities of the program at least at the level that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities were conducted immediately preceding that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(States will be required to provide information to document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their maintenance of effort and funding levels.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with section 4360(e) of OBRA '90, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires the State to submit to us an annual report on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICA program, this rule provides that a State that receives a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant under this program must submit at least one annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to us and any additional reports we prescribe in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of grant award. It further specifies that HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advise the State of the requirements concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency, timing, and contents of the report(s) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of grant award that it sends to the State. This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removes existing paragraph (d) (``Annual report'') from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;403.508 and establishes a new &sect;403.510 (``Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements'') to set forth the reporting requirements as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
F. Administration of Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule adds &sect;403.512(a) to identify those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions that control the administration of the ICA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants. Section 403.512 specifies that health insurance ICA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grants are administered in accordance with the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 CFR part 403, subpart E; certain provisions of 45 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 74 (``Administration of Grants''), 45 CFR part 92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments''), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of the solicitation, and terms of the notice of grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
award. Section 403.512(a) also specifies that, except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum funding levels established by &sect;403.504(b)(1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event of conflict between a provision of the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of grant award and any provision of the solicitation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart E of 42 CFR part 403, or of 45 CFR part 74 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 92, the terms of the notice of grant award prevail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule adds &sect;403.512(b) to state that HCFA provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice to each applicant regarding HCFA's decision on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for grant funding under &sect;403.504. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule adds &sect;403.512(c) to enable States to appeal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 45 CFR part 16, HCFA's determination regarding its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant application. 45 CFR part 16 contains procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appealing a final decision to our Departmental Grant Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board.

G. Technical Change_Definition of ``State'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule revises the definition of ``State'' at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;403.500(c) to correct the inadvertent omission of ``the 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States'' from the definition.

H. Elimination of Supplemental Coordinated Care Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
During fiscal years 1992 and 1993, supplemental grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were awarded to States for intensive, innovative approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to making information, counseling, and/or assistance related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to coordinated care benefits available to Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries. The purpose of the grants was to encourage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with existing coordinated care programs to be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
active in this area. We believe that States have now had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate opportunity and funding to establish supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated care materials and/or activities and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate funding is no longer warranted. States should make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in a grant awarded under &sect;403.502 for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous and/or current initiatives in ICA activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to coordinated care. We may, however, make funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from time to time to fund special ICA-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
III. Collection of Information Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 403.510 of this document contains information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and recordkeeping requirements that were approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 2, 1994. The approval number is 0938&hyph;0641 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration date is January 31, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
IV. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we normally receive on documents published for comment, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, we will consider all comments that we received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this preamble, and if we proceed with a subsequent document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we will respond to the comments in the preamble to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
V. Waiver of Prior Notice with Comment Period and of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delayed Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We ordinarily publish a general notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and invite public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the proposed rule. That rule would have included a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the legal authority under which it is proposed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the terms and substance of the proposed rule or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of the subjects and issues involved. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure can be waived, however, when an agency finds good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause that a notice and comment procedure is impracticable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule issued. Further, we generally provide for final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules to be effective no sooner than 30 days after the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of publication unless we find good cause to waive the delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of this rule, its principal effect is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue the funding of an existing program rather than to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement a new program. The affected entities, that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States, are already familiar with the program and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive separate, individual notice. Further, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable that regulations that will govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of FY 1994 grants be issued as soon as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. Therefore, we find that it would be against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest to delay the publication of this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pending completion of a prior public comment period. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the above reasons, we also find that it would be against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest to delay the effective date of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. States and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals are not included in the definition of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have a significant impact on the operations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule simply establishes the terms and conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of funding for grants. It has no independent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequential effect on the economy. The activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted under the grant may improve competition by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informing consumers of health insurance alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary certifies, that this interim final rule with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period will not have a significant economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities or a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on the operations of a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible for a grant under this subpart, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must have an approved Medicare supplemental regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program under section 1882 of the Act and submit a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to HCFA that meets the requirements of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Section 4360 of Public Law 101&hyph;508 (42 USC

appropriations of funds and, if applicable, subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory progress in the State's project during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preceding grant period. The criteria by which progress is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated and the performance standards for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether satisfactory progress has been made is specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculation of variable portion of the grant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) HCFA bases the variable portion of the grant on_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The amount of available funds, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A comparison of each State with the average of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the States (except the State being compared) with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to three factors that relate to the size of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare population and where that population resides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The factors HCFA uses to compare States' Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations comprise separate components of the variable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount. These factors, and the extent to which they each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to the variable amount, are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Approximately 75 percent of the variable amount is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries living in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State as a percentage of all Medicare beneficiaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Approximately 10 percent of the variable amount is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the percentage of the State's total population who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are Medicare beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Approximately 15 percent of the variable amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on the percentage of the State's Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries that reside in rural areas (``rural areas'' are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined as all areas not included within a Metropolitan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistical Area). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Based on the foregoing four factors (that is, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of available funds and the three comparative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors), HCFA determines a variable rate for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating State for each grant period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

differs from the amount requested in the budget submitted

with its application must submit a revised budget to HCFA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along with its acceptance of the grant award, that reflects

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 843 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103&hyph;160) requires offerors
and contractors under DoD solicitations and contracts exceeding $5,000,000 to report commercial transactions
conducted with the Government of a terrorist country. This interim rule adds new language to DFARS Subpart 209.1,
a new provision at 252.209&hyph;7003, and a new clause at 252.209&hyph;7004 to implement the requirements of Section
843 of Public Law 103&hyph;160. The rule also revises the provision at 252.209&hyph;7001 for consistency with the
terminology used in the new provision and clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because the rule only applies to contracts exceeding $5,000,000. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has
therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected subparts will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act.
Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D319 in correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. A request for approval of the information collection requirement has been sent
to the Office of Management and Budget.

This amends and finalizes an interim rule published as Item VII of DAC 91&hyph;5, at 58 FR 28458, on May 13, 1993, that
implemented 10 U.S.C. 2536. 10 U.S.C. 2536 prohibits award of a DoD contract under a national security program to an
entity controlled by a foreign government, if access to proscribed information is required to perform the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;160) amended 10 U.S.C.
2536 by revising the definition of ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' to exclude organizations and corporations
that are owned, but are not controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a foreign government if the ownership of
the organization or corporation by the foreign government was effective before October 23, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule differs from the interim rule in that it (1) revises the definition of ``entity controlled by a foreign
government'' as required by Section 842 of Public Law 103&hyph;160; (2) revises the definition of ``effectively
owned or controlled'' for clarity; (3) revises the definition of ``foreign government'' for consistency with the
regulations of the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control at 31 CFR Ch. V; and (4) contains minor clarifying
revisions.

The Department of Defense certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because the rule only applies to a small number of contracts and companies. No comments were received on the impact
of this rule on small entities during the public comment period.

 This document amends the Federal Transit

Administration Charter Service Regulation by extending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charter service demonstration program mandated by section 3040 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through October 31, 1995. This extension has been granted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to accommodate several participants in the demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, who consider that the initial demonstration period is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate. It will allow both public and private operators to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the program over two summer and two winter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods, thereby providing FTA with more substantive data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to base its evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 36894) established a charter services demonstration program which would allow transit operators
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the needs of government, civic, charitable and other community activities, as directed by section 3040 of the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Under the program, recipients in eight sites within
four states are allowed to provide direct charter service as determined by local officials. The rule provided that
the demonstration program would be conducted from August 9, 1993, to August 9, 1994.

Because of specific local circumstances, however, certain participants were unable to begin their demonstration
programs on the effective date of August 9, 1993. In order to provide these participants with a full 12-month implementation
period, FTA published, on October 12, 1993, a technical amendment extending the program through October 31, 1994
(58 FR 52684).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1994, the American Public Transit Association (APTA), on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of several transit agencies participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration program, requested a further extension to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both public and private operators to participate in the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over two summer and two winter periods. APTA indicated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension would provide FTA with more complete data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon which to base both its evaluation of the program and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report and recommendations to Congress on the charter regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated by section 3040(c) of ISTEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3040 of ISTEA provides that the demonstration program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be established in consultation with both public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private operators. To this end, FTA developed the program in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with an advisory committee convened for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose, and composed of an equal number of representatives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public and private sectors. Since some private operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the demonstration sites are likely to be affected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the program, FTA forwarded copies of APTA's request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all of the private sector members of the advisory committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for comment. The majority of committee members responding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FTA's request for comments were favorable to an extension of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration program. Moreover, FTA agrees that extending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration would allow the collection of more substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on which to base its evaluation of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FTA hereby extends the charter service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration program for an additional 12-month period, ending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on October 31, 1995. All transit agencies participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program may provide charter services in conformance with 49 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
604.9(b)(8) during this period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department ha determined that this proposed rule is not subject to review under Executive Order 12866. Moreover,
the rule is not significant under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; Feb. 26, 1979).
Since this final rule makes only technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to current regulatory language, it is anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as added by the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, FTA certifies that this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities within the meaning of the Act.

This action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12612 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism and FTA has determined that it does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implications for principles of Federalism that warrant the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. If promulgated, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule will not limit the policy making or administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion of the States, nor will it impose additional costs or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens on the States, nor will it affect the States' abilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to discharge the traditional State governmental functions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise affect any aspect of State sovereignty.

On October 21, 1993, at 58 FR 54320, we requested comments on a proposal by the Association of American Railroads (AAR)
to exempt from regulation the railroad transportation of rock salt and salt. The comments have been received and analyzed.
We are approving AAR's proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment
or the conservation of energy resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the 1994 pollock TAC for Statistical Area 61 is established by the
final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 22,130 metric tons (mt). The fourth quarterly allowance
of that TAC for Statistical Area 61 became available at noon, October 1, 1994, pursuant to &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 TAC for pollock in Statistical Area 61 soon will be reached. The Regional Director established a directed
fishing allowance of 21,500 mt, and has set aside the remaining 630 mt as bycatch to support other anticipated groundfish
fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently,
directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61 is prohibited, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 4, 1994,
until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 NMFS issues a final rule to implement Amendment 31 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI), Amendment 35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA),
and a regulatory amendment affecting the Pacific halibut fishery in and off of the State of Alaska (Alaska or State).
This action implements the Modified Block Proposal, which is necessary to prevent excessive consolidation of the
halibut and sablefish fisheries. This action also clarifies the transfer process for the Individual Fishing Quota
(IFQ) program.

The Modified Block Proposal, as well as the other alternatives for the IFQ program for fixed-gear halibut and sablefish
fisheries, are described in the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (Analysis) dated December 17, 1993. Language amending the BSAI and the GOA FMPs was developed for the Modified
Block Proposal, the Council's chosen alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the FMPs affect the sablefish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska, which are managed
in accordance with the BSAI and the GOA groundfish FMPs. The Council prepared both FMPs under authority of the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic fishery for halibut in and off of Alaska is managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC),
as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the
Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention) and the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act).
The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the Council to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in
conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council
may develop, for approval by NMFS, limited-access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters
in and off of Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council acted under these authorities in recommending changes to the IFQ program for the halibut and sablefish
fisheries. The Council, through these changes, intends to promote the conservation and management of the sablefish
and halibut fisheries, and to further the objectives of the Magnuson Act and the Halibut Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
QS Block Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern over the potential for excessive consolidation of fishing privileges under the IFQ program was the impetus
for the Modified Block Proposal. The Modified Block Proposal provides that (1) initial allocations of QS that represent
less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year will be issued as a block, (2) QS that represent 20,000 lb
(9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year will be ``unblocked'' QS, and (3) QS in a block cannot be separated and
will have to be transferred as a block. For each species in each IFQ regulatory area, a person who does not hold any unblocked
QS can hold up to two QS blocks for that area, but the sum of the two QS blocks cannot exceed use limits in 50 CFR 676.22 (e)
and (f). A person who holds unblocked QS for an IFQ regulatory area can hold only one QS block for that area, provided
that the total QS held, blocked and unblocked, for that IFQ regulatory area does not exceed use limits referenced above.
The Modified Block Proposal also provides that QS blocks resulting in less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut,
or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish, in the implementation year can be combined. The QS block resulting from this
combination cannot exceed 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) for halibut or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish. This ``sweeping-up'' provision
will allow very small QS allocations to be combined into ``fishable'' amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Modified Block Proposal is intended to reduce the maximum potential consolidation relative to the current IFQ
program. The Analysis indicated that, if actual consolidation is proportional to the estimates of maximum potential
consolidation, more QS holders are likely to remain in the halibut and sablefish fisheries under the Modified Block
Proposal than under the current IFQ program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Modified Block Proposal will not interfere with the opportunities currently available under the IFQ program
for larger operations, because QS allocations for an IFQ regulatory area that represent 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of
IFQ in 1994 will remain unblocked. The Council decided that the Modified Block Proposal would protect small producers,
part-time participants, and entry-level participants_who may tend to disappear because of excessive consolidation
under the current IFQ program_without compromising the flexibility and the economic efficiency of the IFQ program
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether QS is blocked or unblocked will be determined by the QS pools for each IFQ regulatory area as they exist on October
17, 1994. Using a specific date to calculate whether to block QS ensures that all persons are treated in a similar manner,
regardless of when their QS is issued. October 17, 1994, was chosen as the date to calculate QS because it was long enough
after the application period, which ended July 15, 1994, to allow the QS pools to achieve QS amounts reflective of their
eventual range, but long enough before the 1995 fishing season to allow for transfers of QS for that fishing season.

Transfer of QS Blocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Blocked and unblocked QS will be transferable subject to the approval of the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional
Director), and compliance with the transfer regulations found in 50 CFR part 676. Changes are made to the transfer
procedure in 50 CFR part 676 to accommodate the Modified Block Proposal, and to clarify further the transfer process.
Further information on the rationale for these changes, and on the Modified Block Proposal, can be found in the proposed
rule published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would have been deleted. This was a technical oversight. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;676.20 will remain
as published on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59375), and will not be amended by this final rule. The amendatory language in
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;676.20, which was in the proposed rule published June 28, 1994, (59 FR 33272)
will be incorporated in paragraph (a) of &sect;676.20 of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The reference to &sect;676.22 in &sect;676.21(c)(2) was changed to &sect;676.22(j) to indicate the paragraph
of the regulatory text intended to be referenced by the citation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-two letters of comments were received regarding the Modified Block Proposal. Twelve letters provided comments
that supported the Modified Block Proposal, eight letters provided comments in opposition, and two letters provided
no comments. These comments, which are summarized and responded to below, were considered during the formulation
of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal is overly restrictive, especially to the smaller vessel categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Though the Modified Block Proposal will have a larger impact on the smaller vessel categories, the determining factor
of whose QS will be blocked is the amount of catch landed and duration of participation during the qualifying years,
not vessel size. Some owners/lessees of large and small vessels will be issued QS as a block, and some owners/lessees
will be issued unblocked QS. More owners/lessees of smaller vessels will have blocked QS due to smaller harvests during
the qualifying years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the QS issued in smaller vessel categories will be blocked. The QS in small blocks will have less value, making
those blocks difficult to market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The response to Comment 1 addresses why most QS issued in smaller vessel categories will be blocked. Any determination
on the value of blocked or unblocked QS, whether in large or small quantities, is purely speculative. Blocked QS may
be more or less valuable than unblocked QS, depending upon market forces. Small blocks, with their lesser overall
dollar value, will make the IFQ Program more accessible to new entrants. Furthermore, the Modified Block Proposal
allows very small blocks to be combined into fishable amounts under the ``sweep-up'' provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All QS should be blocked or unblocked. It is inequitable and discriminatory to block some QS and not other QS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Blocking all QS was considered along with the Modified Block Proposal in the Analysis (see Sitka Block Alternative
and Full/Partial Block Alternative). The Council selected the Modified Block Proposal from among the other block
proposals because: (1) Like the other block alternatives, it prevented excessive consolidation of QS; and (2) unlike
the other block alternatives, it did not interfere with the opportunities currently available to larger operations
in the fixed-gear Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries by blocking all QS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines for FMPs at 50 CFR 602.14 (national standard 4_Allocations) indicates that total parity in allocations
is not necessary to comport with fairness and equity. Allocation decisions by the Council may be fair and equitable
if those decisions are justified in terms of the objectives of the FMP amendment. The Modified Block Proposal was designed
to preserve the way of life for fishermen and their families and the dependence of local communities on the fishery,
which are legitimate social factors provided in the guidelines and identified by the Council. Furthermore, the Modified
Block Proposal does not discriminate between residents of different states, which is the standard specified at &sect;602.14(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal is inequitable because persons who were initially issued QS who owned/leased large vessels
will receive most of their QS unblocked, allowing them to purchase more QS up to the use cap. Persons who were initially
issued QS, however, who owned/leased small vessels will be issued their QS in blocks, preventing them from purchasing
QS up to the use cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in the response to Comment 3, the Modified Block Proposal is not inequitable under the guidelines in 50
CFR part 602. Furthermore, although the Modified Block Proposal restricts the number of QS blocks that can be held
by a person (up to two blocks per species and area), it does not prevent a person from purchasing QS up to the use cap. For
example, if a person is initially issued QS in a block, that person, like a person who was initially issued unblocked
QS, can purchase unblocked QS up to the use cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal creates a monopoly that violates the anti-trust laws. The IFQ Program should be administered
under a ``free market'' system. Gear restrictions, rather than limited access, should be used to manage the resource.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal does not create a monopoly, nor does it violate anti-trust laws. The Modified Block Proposal
was designed to reduce consolidation by ensuring that more persons would hold QS under the Modified Block Proposal
than may have held QS without it. The consolidation that may have occurred without the Modified Block Proposal could
be more accurately characterized as a process that tends toward monopolistic control of the resource. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
QS, whether blocked or unblocked, is a harvest privilege that may be transferred. The value of transferred QS is not
limited by the program. The value of QS will be determined by market forces, and, therefore, the IFQ Program is administered
under a ``free market'' approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although gear restrictions can assist in managing a fishery, effective management requires a holistic approach.
The IFQ Program is one of the many management tools used by NMFS to manage effectively the Pacific halibut and sablefish
fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal will create different classes of QS holders depending on how much QS each person is issued.
The restrictions on the amount of blocks that can be held, along with the various sizes of blocks, may necessitate the
use of brokerage firms to facilitate transfers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal does not create different classes of QS holders. As explained in the response to Comment
1, the Modified Block Proposal establishes the criteria for determining whether QS will be blocked and unblocked.
A person, if issued QS in a block, is not prohibited from obtaining unblocked QS. The transferable nature of QS will
allow persons to hold blocked and/or unblocked QS, as long as the other requirements on holding QS are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Modified Block Proposal may increase QS transaction costs because some persons (i.e., those who already hold
the maximum blocks allowed) will be required to transfer away one block before another block can be transferred to
them. This cost may be exacerbated if the person who is making this transaction has a specific QS amount as a target.
The Analysis for the Modified Block Proposal contemplated and addressed this increase in transaction costs for transfers.
NMFS concluded from the Analysis that the benefits of curbing excessive consolidation outweighed the increase of
transaction costs for transfers.

Comment 7: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because blocks cannot be divided under the Modified Block Proposal, seizure of assets by the Internal Revenue Service
to collect on delinquent taxes would mean that the entire block would be seized, rather than just the portion of QS necessary
to satisfy the delinquency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This course of events (i.e., seizing the entire block to satisfy a debt) was evaluated during the formulation of the
rule. NMFS decided that the administrative costs associated with dividing blocks was not justifiable, especially
because any inconvenience that may occur by seizing the entire block is due to the QS block holder's own delinquency.
QS blocks can be sold to satisfy the existing debt like any other indivisible asset. After the debt has been satisfied,
excess funds can be returned to the person whose block had been seized.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There will be no significant increase in administrative or enforcement costs because of the Modified Block Proposal.
The Modified Block Proposal will affect the initial allocation and transfer of QS. This can be monitored by the computer
at Restricted Access Management Division, NMFS, Alaska Region, which is currently programmed to perform this task.
The Modified Block Proposal will not affect IFQ resource harvesting or deliveries, minimizing any impacts on enforcement.

The Modified Block Proposal will decrease consolidation of fishing operations under the IFQ program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal was intended to prevent excessive consolidation that might have occurred under the IFQ
program. This rationale is discussed at length in the Analysis for the Modified Block Proposal and the proposed rule
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33272). In brief, the Modified Block Proposal will prevent excessive consolidation by blocking
a portion of the total amount of QS issued and by restricting the number of blocks that can be held by an individual. These
actions will increase the potential minimum holders of QS to an amount greater than under the status quo.

Comment 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal will create block sizes that will provide easy access to the IFQ fisheries and maintain
diversity in the longline fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Modified Block Proposal, all initially issued QS that would result in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ using
the 1994 total allowable catch (TAC) would be blocked. This means that a variety of block sizes will be created, and
will be available for transfer. Persons who would like to enter the fishery would be able to secure a smaller block,
and then subsequently transfer the smaller block for a larger block as the fishing operation grows and the experience
of the person increases. This ``step'' approach, made possible by the Modified Block Proposal, assists in the growth
of each operation to efficient economies of scale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the size and amount of QS blocks will remain constant, except for consolidation of the smallest blocks under
the ``sweep-up'' provision. This means that at least the minimum number of QS block holders will hold blocks of various
sizes, providing diversity in the longline fleet.

Comment 11: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Modified Block Proposal will benefit coastal communities dependent on the IFQ fisheries by reducing the amount
of QS that can be consolidated into larger operations, ensuring a more uniform landing pattern of fishery product,
and providing higher levels of harvesting employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS concurs with this comment. Along with reducing excessive consolidation, the Modified Block Proposal was designed
to benefit local coastal communities traditionally dependent on the Pacific halibut and sablefish fixed-gear fisheries.
As explained earlier, QS blocks will maintain diversity in the longline fleet by reducing the amount of QS available
for consolidation by larger operations. Also, smaller, locally owned and operated vessels are more likely to deliver
to local communities than larger vessels. This is because large vessels typically have the capacity to store large
quantities of fishery product for extended periods of time, thus enabling these vessels to deliver to ports other
than those located in local coastal communities.

By increasing the potential minimum number of QS holders, the Modified Block Proposal will provide more employment
for fishermen and crew members. By increasing the potential for delivery of fishery product in coastal communities,
the Modified Block Proposal will provide more employment in the fishery processing sector for those communities.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS concurs with this comment. On the other hand, if the Modified Block Proposal is not adopted at this time, adoption
at a later time will not accomplish the same goals. Transfers and consolidation of QS that could occur if the Modified
Block Proposal is not in place when the IFQ program is implemented might cause irrevocable damage to coastal communities
and the small vessel fleet.

The Council prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) that indicates the action will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. By reducing consolidation, the Modified Block Proposal
may increase the total cost of harvesting the resource, thereby decreasing the net economic benefits of the IFQ Program
and increasing harvesting costs to small entities. The analysis in the FRFA also indicates that by reducing consolidation,
the Modified Block Proposal may result in higher levels of harvesting employment. Higher levels of harvesting employment
and maintenance of diversity in fishing operations participating in the IFQ Program are the main goals of the Modified
Block Proposal. A copy of the FRFA is available from the Council (see

Eligibility to receive QS or IFQ by transfer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All persons applying to receive QS or IFQ must submit an Application for Eligibility to Receive QS/IFQ (Application
for Eligibility), containing accurate information, to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will not approve
a transfer of IFQ or QS to a person until the Application for Eligibility for that person is approved by the Regional
Director. The Regional Director shall provide an Application for Eligibility form to any person on request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A person must indicate on the Application for Eligibility whether the eligibility sought is as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A corporation, partnership, or other entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A person may submit the Application for Eligibility with the Application for Transfer or file the Application
for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer. If a person, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)
of this section, files the Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer, and that
person's status subsequently changes, as described in &sect;676.22(j), that person must resubmit an Application
for Eligibility before submitting, or with, the Application for Transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Regional Director's approval of an Application for Eligibility will be mailed to the person by certified mail.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Regional Director will notify the applicant if an Application for Eligibility is disapproved. This notification
of disapproval will include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The disapproved Application for Eligibility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An explanation why the Application for Eligibility was not approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Reasons for disapproval of an Application for Eligibility may include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fewer than 150 days of experience working as an IFQ crew member; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Lack of compliance with the U.S. citizenship or corporate ownership requirements specified by the definition
of ``person'' at &sect;676.11; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An incomplete Application for Eligibility; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal
fishery violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfers of QS blocks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A QS block must be transferred as an undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block exceeds the use limits specified
at &sect;676.22. If the QS block to be transferred exceeds the use limits specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;676.22, the Regional Director will divide the block into two blocks, one block containing the maximum amount
of QS allowable under the QS use limits and the other block containing the residual QS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) QS blocks representing less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut or less than 3,000 lb (1.9 mt) for sablefish,
based on the factors listed in &sect;676.20(a), for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, may be consolidated
into larger QS blocks, provided that the consolidated QS blocks do not represent greater than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ
for halibut or greater than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish based on the factors listed in &sect;676.20(a). A
consolidated QS block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use and transferability.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard is requiring all U.S. flag oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and all other U.S. flag ships of 400
gross tons and above, to carry approved shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. These regulations also require
foreign oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and other foreign ships of 400 gross tons and above, to carry evidence
of compliance with Regulation 26 when in the navigable waters of the United States. The regulations implement the
requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,
1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). The purpose of Regulation 26 is to improve response
capabilities and minimize the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships.

Regulatory History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 5, 1993, the Coast Guard released Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 2&hyph;93 to provide
guidance to the affected community on compliance before Regulation 26 became effective for new ships on April 4, 1993.
The NVIC has no regulatory force; it simply provided guidance until the issuance of this regulation. The Coast Guard
also issued Change 1 to NVIC 2&hyph;93 on July 28, 1993, providing shipowners with the current list of national operational
contact points adopted by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC). On February 17, 1994, the Coast
Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 8086). The Coast Guard received 36 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (the Act) authorizes the Coast Guard to administer and enforce Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention
of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). Annex I of MARPOL 73/78
is entitled ``Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Oil'' and is designed to prevent the discharge of oil
into the marine environment. MARPOL 73/78 defines oil as petroleum in any form, including crude oil, fuel oil, sludge,
oil refuse, and refined products; it does not include animal or vegetable based oil or noxious liquid substances.

Regulation 26 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MEPC of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 at its 31st
session in July 1991. Regulation 26 requires every oil tanker of 150 gross tons and above and every other ship of 400
gross tons and above to carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan approved by its flag state. This requirement
entered into force for party states, including the United States, on April 4, 1993, for new ships and enters into force
on April 4, 1995, for existing ships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 32nd session of IMO in March 1992 adopted a set of guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)) with more specific information
for the preparation of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. The guidelines are intended to assist parties to
Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 in developing regulations for domestic implementation of Regulation 26, and are the basis
of this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The procedure to be followed by the master or other persons having charge of the ship to report an oil pollution incident,
as required in article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78;

Discussion of Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirty-six public comments were received in response to the NPRM. The Coast Guard has reviewed all of the comments
and, in some instances, revised the rule as appropriate. The comments have been grouped by issue, and are discussed
as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that the term ``oil pollution emergency plan'' should be defined in the rule to include the response
plans required by other Federal agencies under OPA 90. The Coast Guard disagrees that this rulemaking should address
response plans required by other Federal agencies. However, this rule does not prohibit addressing other Federal,
State, or local requirements within the required plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments addressed the issue of applying Regulation 26 provisions to ships operating exclusively on the Great
Lakes or their connecting and tributary waters, or exclusively on the internal waters of the U.S. Three comments stated
that the requirements of Regulation 26 of MARPOL 73/78 should apply to vessels operating exclusively in the Great
Lakes. Because Canada will be requiring an oil pollution emergency plan within all waters under Canadian jurisdiction,
these comments encouraged the U.S. Coast Guard to implement consistent requirements to ensure a comparable level
of environmental protection throughout the Great Lakes. Another comment opposed applying Annexes I and II of MARPOL
73/78 to the Great Lakes arguing that the legislative history clearly indicates that Annexes I and II were intended
to apply to seagoing vessels only and not to vessels operating in internal waters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of the Act demonstrates congressional intent that Annexes I and II not apply to ships operating
exclusively on the Great Lakes. Therefore, the Coast Guard will not apply the requirements to ships operating exclusively
in these waters in this rule. The Coast Guard is still considering all comments received on this issue and is working
with the Canadian government to determine the best approach to resolve inconsistent requirements for ships operating
exclusively on the Great Lakes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments agreed with the applicability of this rule as it relates to mobile offshore drilling units (MODU's)
and fixed or floating drilling rigs or other platforms. All comments suggested revising the language of this section
to avoid misinterpretations. One suggested changing the format of the applicability section to describe which facilities
are covered rather than those that are exempt from the requirements. Another recommended distinguishing MODUs from
other types of floating rigs. The final comment wanted the Coast Guard to include information concerning other Federal
or State regulations that may be applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to remain consistent with IMO Guidelines the Coast Guard will not revise the language of the text. The format
of the applicability section remains consistent with IMO Guidelines (Resolution MEPC.54(32)). However, for clarification,
Regulation 26 requirements apply to MODUs not engaged in their primary mode of operation, and apply to all MODUs while
in transit. In addition, this rulemaking was not intended to include other Federal or State requirements. Rather,
the Coast Guard encourages shipowners to consult other Federal, State, or local laws for additional requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments discussed the application of Regulation 26 to unmanned vessels. One comment recommended that unmanned
vessels be exempted from the requirement to have a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan aboard. The comment pointed
out that there will be no one aboard to use the plan and no place to store it. The other comment questioned whether U.S.
flag manned or unmanned tank barges will be required to carry approved plans. The Coast Guard recognizes the need to
specifically address the requirements for manned and unmanned vessels. Accordingly, &sect;151.27(a) has been
revised. All manned vessels subject to the regulation must carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan
approved by the Coast Guard. For unmanned vessels subject to the regulation, the notification list required in &sect;151.25(b)(3)
must be carried on board in the documentation container. The remaining sections of the plan must be maintained at the
vessel's home office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that language exempting vessels ``constructed or operated in such a manner that no oil can be
discharged from any portion thereof, intentionally or unintentionally *&blank;*&blank;*'' be deleted because
there is no guarantee that oil will not be spilled. The Coast Guard agrees with this suggestion and has revised &sect;151.09(d)(2)
to state more clearly which vessels are exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested clarification on the tonnage to be used in determining the applicability to offshore marine
service vessels. The Coast Guard maintains that tonnage requirements are clearly defined and does not agree that
further clarification is necessary. Another comment pointed out that dedicated oil spill response vessels (OSRVs),
including dedicated tank barges, should be specifically exempted when not carrying cargo in bulk or when operating
in spill response areas as designated by the Federal On-scene Coordinator (FOSC). The Coast Guard does not agree with
this comment because the requirements of Regulation 26 apply to all ships that carry oil.

3. Ships of Countries not Party to MARPOL
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment expressed concern that non-party states may be afforded more favorable treatment than party states.
The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. As discussed in &sect;151.29, ships operating under the authority
of a country that is not a party to MARPOL, must comply with &sect;151.21 of this rule while in the navigable waters of
the United States. However, the Coast Guard has amended the definition of ``shipboard oil pollution emergency plan''
to clarify the requirements for non-party states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Plan format. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments addressed the format of the plan. One contended that the format and the language of the plan was too inflexible.
The comment further stated that owners should be permitted to deviate from form as long as the content of the plan satisfied
the requirements. The other comment stressed that the plan would be more useful in an emergency if it were a uniform,
fleetwide plan. To further international consistency and in recognition of such plans, the Coast Guard has adopted
the framework of the plan as set out in the IMO guidelines. The Coast Guard has determined that the plan allows for sufficient
flexibility. However, the material within the required sections can be developed with some flexibility by owners
and operators so they can be designed around their own ship's operations. Furthermore, requiring owners and operators
to create their own plans is preferable to having a uniform plan. The Coast Guard has determined that it helps them become
familiar with their own procedures, making them better prepared for an emergency.

Two comments suggested that the format proposed in the NPRM should be in accordance with Resolution MEPC.54(32).
One of these comments also suggested that the Coast Guard accept and approve plans formatted in five sections in accordance
with Resolution MEPC.54(32), as well as those formatted in seven sections as specified in the NPRM. The Coast Guard
will continue to require that seven sections be included in the plan. These seven sections contain the same information
as the five sections in the Resolution MEPC.54(32). The Coast Guard has only reorganized the numbering to include
the required ``Introduction'' and ``Appendices'' as additional sections. This organizational change was made
to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements and help ensure that all requirements are incorporated into the
plan. The Coast Guard has added a sample index in Table 151.26(b)(8) of the rule to help the owner or operator properly
prepare the plan.

One comment recommended that the rule specify introductory text for use when a plan complies with both Regulation
26 and the OPA 90 vessel response plan (VRP) requirements. The Coast Guard disagrees; this rule does not establish
requirements for plans required by &sect;155.1030. Shipowners who wish to submit combined Regulation 26 and OPA
90 vessel response plans should refer to 33 CFR 155.1030(j).

Preamble. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment noted that the preamble is not clear on the meaning of ``other shore-based plans.'' Basically, the Coast
Guard wants the owner and operator to be cognizant of existing State plans or other municipal plans, and plans of other
countries which may be applicable. They should consider if their Regulation 26 plan works well with other plans in
the system. Another comment recommends amending the preamble to make Regulation 26 plans consistent with area plans.
The Coast Guard maintains that shipboard oil pollution emergency plans are consistent with separate area plans.
National and local coordination is discussed in &sect;151.26(b)(5) which requires that information be provided
to assist the master initiate action by the coastal state, local government, or other involved party. The plan must
include guidance to assist the master in organizing a response, should there be no organized response by shore authorities.

Reporting Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six comments recommended that the Coast Guard require an Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) or some other type
of approved spill response contractor. They argued that these organizations will respond to an oil pollution incident
more effectively than cooperatives, individually contracted by shipowners. Three comments suggested that ship
owners or operators identify an individual qualified to respond. They contended that it will ensure that someone
is authorized to make decisions for the owner or operator on an immediate basis. The Coast Guard has determined that,
although it can not require this information, inclusion would enhance the plan and make it more effective. Further,
this concept is consistent with guidance contained in IMO Resolution A.741(18). Therefore, the Coast Guard has added
the identification of such persons and equipment to the list of non-mandatory provisions in &sect;151.26(b)(7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments recommended that the Coast Guard consider an umbrella plan which covers multiple vessels. This approach
would allow incoming vessels to pay a fee to be covered by a State approved contingency plan and to have a primary contractor
immediately available. The Coast Guard disagrees with the concept of a ``model plan'' approach because it is important
for owners or operators to produce their own plans so that they are familiar with the process and the associated risks
involved. However, we agree that owners or operators should be able to utilize a standard plan covering similar types
of ships in their fleet. Accordingly, &sect;151.27(c) has been added to incorporate this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with IMO guidelines, plan writers should consider the many variables in determining whether ships can
be grouped under the same plan. These variables may include type and size of ship, cargo, route, and shore based management
structure. For example single skinned oil tankers could be grouped in one plan, while double hulled tankers should
be grouped in another. It is important to note that although one plan can cover similar ships in an owner or operator's
fleet, an approved plan must be on board each ship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because multiple ships can be grouped under a single plan, and consistent with IMO guidelines, each plan must clearly
identify each ship to which the plan applies. The Coast Guard has determined that the ship's name, call sign, official
number, International Maritime Organization (IMO) international number, and principal characteristics are important
details that ensure that the plan applies to the particular ship for which it was intended. Section 151.26(b)(1)(ii)(A)
has been added to incorporate this requirement.

Six comments addressed the notification form in Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A), that contains information to be provided
in the initial and follow-up reports. Two of the comments suggested evaluating the sample report format with respect
to the information required by the National Response Center (NRC). This would facilitate the timely transfer of information
to the NRC when the report is made. The Coast Guard agrees that the information on the form should coordinate with that
required by the NRC. The Coast Guard has worked with the NRC to provide consistent reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment noted that the information on the form differs slightly from the information required to be reported
under 33 CFR 151.15(e). The Coast Guard has determined that this issue warrants further consideration. The reporting
requirements in 33 CFR part 151 will be updated to reflect amendments to Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78 in a future rulemaking
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other two comments pointed out that the sample report format should require an estimate of the volume of oil spilled
during the incident. The Coast Guard agrees that there should be a place on the form to give brief details of the pollution
incident; this would include an estimate of the quantity of cargo lost. Block ``RR'' of Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A)
already provides a place for this information to be recorded. Another comment notes that a space for the vessel's ``noun
name'' be included in the report. The Coast Guard agrees and has already provided block ``AA'' as the location for listing
the ship's name, call sign, or flag. Additionally, one comment stated that the incident reports be kept on file with
the plan and summarized with each annual letter. The Coast Guard has determined that there is no basis for establishing
this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments stated that qualifications on reportable conditions should be replaced with requirements consistent
with section 155.1035 of the interim final rule (IFR) for vessel response plans (58 FR 7424; February 5, 1993). They
noted that there is no need to add additional qualifiers when either a spill has occurred or there is a threat of a spill.
The Coast Guard disagrees and points out that reporting requirements for this rulemaking reflect the MARPOL standard.
They are not intended to mirror notification requirements described in &sect;155.1035 which were issued under separate
legislation. As a result, the notification requirements will remain consistent with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL
73/78 as intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment received suggested that a note be added to indicate that (for vessels in U.S. waters) a report made in conformance
with 46 CFR 4.04 satisfies the reporting requirements for probable discharges. The Coast Guard disagrees and contends
that regulations issued for marine casualties in 46 CFR part 4 were issued under separate legislation and do not require
notification to the NRC. This comment also suggests that we modify the information provided by MEPC/CIRC.267 to include
the phone number for the NRC. The Coast Guard supports this suggestion and has included the phone number in &sect;151.26(b)(3)(iii)(B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment contended that rather than merely referring to Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78, that the specific required
procedures should be listed. The Coast Guard disagrees, preferring to reference Protocol I of MARPOL which may be
amended periodically by the MARPOL Parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment contended that this rulemaking is redundant with the current requirements of 33 CFR 151.15. This
comment wanted it made clear what relationship and impact the proposed regulations have on current regulations in
33 CFR 151. This rule implements the requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 and will be added to the
existing MARPOL requirements published in 33 CFR 151. The purpose of Regulation 26 is to improve response capabilities
by establishing requirements to carry on board an oil pollution emergency plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment noted that it is unclear whether all incidents resulting in equipment failure or breakdown should be reported
or only those failures that may cause a probable discharge. They continued that reporting all incidents of equipment
failures may result in an undue burden on shipboard and shoreside response personnel. Further, this comment agrees
that the status and the role of all equipment that relates to the incident should be reported in the case of a probable
discharge. Reporting requirements placed in &sect;151.26(b)(3)(i)(A) require notification of equipment damage
whenever there is a discharge or probable discharge of oil. It is recognized that it is impracticable to lay down a precise
definition of a probable discharge which would warrant an obligation to report. Nevertheless, as a general guideline,
reports should be made in cases of damage, failure, or breakdown which affect the safety of a ship. In addition, notification
should be made in cases of failure or breakdown of machinery or equipment which result in impairment of the safety of
navigation. The Coast Guard does not feel the notification requirements place an undue burden on ship operators.
These requirements are currently in force under Article 8 and Protocol I of MARPOL. Furthermore, the information
could be helpful in preventing a possible spill. The Coast Guard agrees that information on the status and role of all
equipment in the case of probable discharge would be useful. This information can be placed in the supplemental section
of the notification form if desired. However, this information will not be required. Initial notification must not
be delayed pending collection of this information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Seven comments addressed the steps to control a discharge section. Generally, all comments supported this section,
but suggested additional requirements be added. One comment was very supportive of the required checklists. This
comment also recommends that a new (C), (D), (E), and (F) be added. The comment suggested that these sections address
contracting with an approved spill response contractor, procedures for handling oily waste and recovered oil, strategies
for protecting the marine environment, and the type of communication system to be used. One comment recommended that
this section include five more parts to be compatible with Washington State requirements. Four comments urged the
Coast Guard to require prevention measures to be identified in the plan. One of the comments noted that prevention
rather than control of an oil spill should be emphasized. Furthermore, one comment requested that leak detection
equipment be required. Two comments noted that the scenarios should include procedures for responding to different
sizes and types of spills. Another comment questioned whether current regulatory requirements exist to ensure the
competency of masters and other key shipboard personnel such as training, prior experience, testing, and licensing.
Additionally, one comment suggested that the Coast Guard require an initial or follow-up report identifying where
damage stability and longitudinal strength information can be located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation 26 was intended to require a simple plan. IMO guidelines were designed in part to help reduce error in an
emergency situation. Additional requirements would be beyond the scope of this rulemaking. While most of the information
suggested by the comments are covered by other plans, this information can be included in the non-mandatory section
of the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan at the shipowner's discretion.

 Five comments expressed concerns about national and local coordination. Two comments stated that the requirements
in this section should be eliminated unless there was a specific purpose outside the scope of the international regulations.
Additionally, one of these comments stated that the requirements are ambiguous. It should be understood that the
IMO guidelines, upon which these rules are based, were intentionally designed to be flexible enough to meet the special
needs of various ships operating throughout the world.

One comment stated that coverage under an OPA 90 vessel response plan should satisfy the requirements of &sect;151.26(b)(5),
provided the list of agencies and contacts required in &sect;151.26(b)(6) are included for all of the vessel's operating
areas. Another comment argued that combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plans and vessel response plans required
by this part must be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR part 151. The Coast Guard disagrees with this comment and maintains
that Regulation 26 requirements should remain consistent with international standards. However, the OPA 90 vessel
response plan allows for submission of a combined plan that includes information from both the vessel response plan
and the shipboard oil pollution emergency plan, provided the single plan complies with both sets of requirements.
A combined plan must be prepared in accordance with 33 CFR section 155.1030(j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments recommended that the section requiring detailed information for specific areas should be required
and not optional. Another comment suggested that the appendices should include detailed information for specific
areas, including which resources to call and which countries will respond to an incident and which will not. The Coast
Guard disagrees with these comments and will not require detailed information on specific areas. This information
will remain optional in accordance with IMO guidelines. However, the Coast Guard encourages shipowners to voluntarily
include this information to be better prepared in case of an oil spill emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Appendices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four comments argued that the requirement to list and inform ``all parties with a financial interest in the ship''
should be deleted. One comment suggested that the entire appendix be omitted because the responsibility for informing
parties with a financial interest in the ship usually rests with management. Furthermore, they argue that the master
should only be concerned with notifications and actions necessary to mitigate the emergency, not managing business
that can be handled by the shoreside crisis management team. Another comment stated that the operator's staff should
determine and make the necessary contacts in regard to insurance and salvage interests. One comment believes that
the list required be limited to ship and cargo owners and insurers only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has revised the language of the rule to be more consistent with IMO guidelines. However, the Coast Guard
maintains its position that the plan should provide details of all parties with a ``financial interest'' in the ship
who are to be advised in the event of an incident. The required information should be provided in the form of a contact
list. The Coast Guard recognizes that in the event of a serious incident, ship's personnel will be fully engaged in
saving life and taking steps to minimize the effects of the casualty. The comprehensive list of contacts may be maintained
in the corporate office if so noted in the plan. While procedures may vary between companies it is important that the
plan clearly specifies who will be responsible for informing the various interested parties such as cargo owners,
insurers, and salvage interests. It is also essential that both the ship's plan and its shoreside plan are coordinated
to guarantee that all parties having an interest are advised and to avoid duplication of reports.

One comment noted that the list of agencies or administrations which receive and act upon incident reports contained
in this section should not include areas of the world not traveled such as Asia and Europe for U.S. coastwise vessels.
They believe that only rescue coordination centers should be listed. The Coast Guard requires that ship owners or
operators whose vessels operate exclusively within U.S. coastal waters include in the list of coastal state administrations
the agencies or officials of only those coastal states reasonably expected to be affected in the case of a spill. However,
the Coast Guard has not changed the requirement to provide this list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-mandatory provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Five comments indicated that the non-mandatory provisions should remain non-mandatory and in accordance with Regulation
26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. However, six comments argued that the non-mandatory provisions should become mandatory
and not be left to the discretion of the owner or operator. Additionally, one comment noted that plan exercising should
be the only element of these provisions that should be mandatory. One comment contended that the non-mandatory provisions
of Regulation 26 should be completely withdrawn from the final rule. One comment advised the Coast Guard to change
certain terminology to make section 151.26(b) ``advisory'' instead of mandatory. The Coast Guard has determined
to keep the non-mandatory provisions voluntary. To better clarify this point the word ``should'' in &sect;151.26(b)(7)
has been replaced by the word ``may''. The Coast Guard encourages ship owners or operators to include non-mandatory
provisions in their plans. This information is only intended to assist in an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment, in favor of making these provisions mandatory, made several specific recommendations as to what each
section should describe and include. One other comment recommended that it be made clear that a point of contact must
be established on board to coordinate response activities. Also, according to this comment, the onboard coordinator
should have the authority to commit to the hiring of resources in a timely manner. As previously stated, the Coast Guard
has added designation of an Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) and an Individual Qualified to Respond to the list
of non-mandatory provisions. Additional information can be included in plans submitted if desired.

5. Plan Submission and Approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eight comments discussed the time-frame for submission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans for initial review,
reapproval, or for corrections to deficiencies in the plan. Five of those comments questioned whether 60 days is adequate
time for the Coast Guard to review the plans. Three comments discussed expanding the time limit. Their suggestions
included expanding the deadline from 60 days to 6 months, 120 days, and 60 days prior to April 4, 1995. Two comments urged
the Coast Guard to make provisions to allow vessels that have submitted plans by the required 60 days prior to April
4, 1995, but who have not received Coast Guard approval by April 4, 1995, to continue operating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard has modified the time-frame for submission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans in response
to these comments. The rule has been revised so there will be adequate time for the plans to be reviewed. Plans must be
submitted for new ships 90 days before the ship intends to begin operations. Existing ships are required to submit
plans no later than January 4, 1995 (90 days prior to April 4, 1995). The Coast Guard will make determinations on all
submitted shipboard oil pollution emergency plans meeting this deadline. Because the April 4, 1995 deadline is fixed,
the Coast Guard encourages ship owners or operators to submit their plans as soon as possible, in case subsequent revisions
are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard recognizes that there is a possibility that a plan received by January 4, 1995, may not receive Coast
Guard approval by April 4, 1995. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to develop a policy of conditional acceptance,
whereby plans having a completed review by April 4, 1995, would be subject to a preliminary review checklist. If the
plan meets the criteria of the preliminary review, a letter would be sent to the shipowner or operator authorizing
continued operations until the Coast Guard completes its final review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment recommended allowing 45 days for correction of deficiencies in the plan. One other comment recommended
a 60-day period for reapproval of the plan. The time period allowed for submitting plan revisions has been changed
from within 45 days of receipt of the notice. Revisions are to be resubmitted within the required time period specified
in the written notice. Although the time period for resubmission will normally be 45 days, this time period could be
lengthened by the Coast Guard when extensive revisions are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six comments addressed where the plans should be sent for review and approval. Four of the comments specifically stated
that the review process should take place at Coast Guard Headquarters. The other two comments suggested that any single
entity perform the review. The bases for their suggestions are for consistency in review, to avoid misinterpretation
of the regulations, and to avoid the confusion and varying levels of quality that a multiple-authority review system
would cause. The Coast Guard generally agrees with these comments. Therefore, &sect;&sect;151.27 and 151.28 have
been revised to reflect that all plans will be submitted to Commandant (G&hyph;MEP&hyph;6) at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters.
As a result of this decision, the Coast Guard has changed the final rule to require only one copy of the plan to be submitted
to Headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that this section should be modified to clarify how operators can submit amendments to their existing
OPA 90 VRP to satisfy these requirements. The provisions for amending existing vessel response plans are located
in 33 CFR section 155.1070. One other comment recommended charging a fee of $55.00 for the review of response plans
to recover the Federal Government's costs associated with the implementation of this rule. Imposition of a ``user
fee'' is outside the scope of this rulemaking. It may be separately addressed in a future rulemaking.

6. Plan Review and Revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments addressed a specific time limit for plan review or revision. One of these comments noted that a time limit
for submission of revisions or amendments should be in place. The Coast Guard finds that the requirements in &sect;151.28,
that the review must occur within 1 month of the anniversary date of Coast Guard approval of the plan, establishes a
time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the 5-year approval period for the plan seems excessive. It suggested that the regulations
should require notification to the Coast Guard within 3 months of implementing any changes to the plan, but that the
approval should continue indefinitely. The 5-year approval expiration date was selected to align with the VRP requirements.
The Coast Guard has determined that an indefinite approval is not possible. The Coast Guard finds that the plan validity
needs to be evaluated at least every 5 years. Therefore, the Coast Guard concludes that the 5-year plan approval expiration
date will remain and a formal request must be made to the Coast Guard at that time for reapproval of the existing plan
or approval of a new plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments opposed the requirement to submit an annual letter to the Coast Guard certifying that the review has
been completed. Two comments supported the review, but viewed the letter as unnecessary. Further, one of the comments
stated that the Coast Guard should only require the owner or operator to perform the annual review. They contended
that this would minimize unnecessary paperwork. The other comment suggested that rather than just requiring a review
and a letter to the Coast Guard, a requirement that the letter highlight alterations needed to the plan and discuss
any spill incidents occurring within the past year should be added to this section of the regulation. Additionally,
one comment stated that the annual review letter should be more specific and summarize spill incidents and identify
the preventive measures taken. The Coast Guard has determined that receiving an annual letter certifying that the
annual review has been completed helps keep the Coast Guard abreast of plan revisions on a yearly basis. The Coast Guard
opposes requiring additional information because it might create an unnecessary burden for shipowners or operators.

Four comments addressed the term ``homeport.'' Two of the comments contended that the term is incorrect. They suggested
use of the terms vessel's ``port of certification'' or ``port of record.'' One of the comments stated that the NPRM
should address procedures for plan approval should a vessel change its homeport. As discussed earlier, the Coast
Guard has eliminated the requirements to have plans, revisions, and annual letters submitted to the COTP or OCMI at
the ship's home port. Therefore, the term ``homeport'' is no longer used in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment writer found the reference to ``appropriate appendices'' confusing, and suggested that a better approach
would be to use language similar to that contained in &sect;155.1070(a)(3). The Coast Guard agrees that the reference
to ``appropriate appendices'' could be misunderstood. Therefore, &sect;151.28(d) has been revised to specify
that a record of the annual review and changes to the plan must be maintained in the last appendix of section six. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four comments expressed concern about consistency with other plans, such as the vessel response plan and the Washington
State contingency planning requirements. Their biggest concern was that the requirements of this plan may cause
major revisions to their existing plans, and that they may not provide for a rational mix of the requirements. The Coast
Guard understands the concerns expressed in these comments. However, this plan does not require extensive revisions
to any plan. The VRP IFR allows for the submission of a vessel response plan which complies with both sets of response
plan requirements. Tank vessel owners or operators may find it helpful to refer to &sect;155.1030 of the VRP IFR for
additional requirements. This rule does not address other State or local requirements.

One comment argued that the rule discriminates against foreign flag vessels and, therefore, is not in accordance
with customary international law. Furthermore, the comment states that U.S. vessels should be subject to the same
standards as foreign vessels in the navigable waters of the U.S. Both U.S. ships and foreign ships must carry a shipboard
oil pollution emergency plan on board while in the navigable waters of the United States.

8. Discussion of Other Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment supported the Coast Guard's efforts to require a larger segment of the maritime industry to plan for spills
and supports working within the MARPOL Convention to establish international consistency. Furthermore, the comment
stated that consistency in planning requirements is the key to a better and more efficient system. The Coast Guard
agrees that ensuring consistency in planning requirements is one key step towards a more efficient system. The Coast
Guard finds that this plan is consistent on an international level. The comment also urged the Coast Guard to increase
the specificity of the planning requirements. The Coast Guard finds that an appropriate amount of specificity is
included. Therefore, the Coast Guard has concluded that it has provided a sufficient framework to build on. One comment
requested an extension of the comment period. The Coast Guard received comments after the comment period for the notice
of proposed rulemaking had closed. These comments were reviewed and included in the discussion of comments and changes.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph
10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared and is available in the docket (CGD 93&hyph;030)
for inspection or copying where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Evaluation is summarized as follows. This rule will not result in annual costs of $100 million or more. It will have
no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, or other aspects of the economy, and will not result in
a major increase in costs and prices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard assumes that 1,234 existing non-tank vessels will prepare shipboard oil pollution emergency plans
to meet the requirements of Regulation 26. In addition, the Coast Guard assumes that 284 existing tank vessels will
prepare and submit combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plans and OPA 90 vessel response plans. The Coast Guard
estimates that 16 ships will be constructed in the United States between April 4, 1993 and April 4, 1995. Therefore,
the Coast Guard estimates that a total of 1,534 U.S. flag ships must comply with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on hourly cost data of those required to comply with Regulation 26, it is estimated to cost $4,320.00 to prepare
a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan. It is estimated to cost $855.00 to prepare the additional requirements
of a VRP that complies with MARPOL Regulation 26. The total cost to respondents for initial plan preparation in the
first year (1994) is estimated to be $5,642,820. In following years, the cost to industry will be based upon new vessels
that need to prepare an initial plan and vessels already complying that need to make revisions and obtain annual certification.
Review and revisions will take an average of 2 hours per vessel per year. Because an increasing number of new vessels
will be preparing initial plans each year, the costs will change accordingly. The Coast Guard will review submitted
shipboard oil pollution emergency plans to ensure compliance with Regulation 26. Total government costs associated
with the review of the plans are estimated to be $423,228 in the first year (1994). Review of revisions and certification
is expected to take an average of 0.75 hours per vessel per year. Again, the costs will change each year based on an increasing
number of new vessels coming into service. The net present value of the cost for the first 3 years, discounted at 7 percent,
is $5,626,297.25 to industry and $484,282.92 to the Coast Guard. The total net present value of the regulation for
1994, 1995, and 1996, is $6,110,580.17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dollar value of direct societal benefits derived from the rule are not quantifiable, but may be substantial. Historical
data is insufficient to quantify benefits. However, this program should improve response capabilities and minimize
the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships. If efficiencies in the cleanup of spilled oil go up by only a
small percentage, the savings that would accrue to the maritime industry and to the public would exceed the costs.

Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments received addressed the effects of this rulemaking on small entities. The Coast Guard expects that few
new costs will be associated with this rule because few small entities own ships of the gross tonnage to which this regulation
will apply. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains collection-of-information requirements in &sect;&sect;151.26, 151.27, and 151.28. The Coast
Guard submitted the requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and OMB has assigned approval number 2115&hyph;0610. The Coast Guard has consolidated this information collection
(OMB approval number 2115&hyph;0610) into the information collection for response plans (OMB approval number is
2115&hyph;0595). The Coast Guard is currently awaiting approval of this consolidated information collection requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule
is expected to contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of ship-generated oil spills in the marine environment.

guidance on measures to be taken to reduce the head of oil in the tank involved either by internal transfer or discharge
ashore. Procedures to handle situations where it is not possible to identify the specific tank from which leakage
is occurring must also be provided. Procedures for dealing with suspected hull fractures must be included. These
procedures must take into account the effect of corrective actions on hull stress and stability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Spills resulting from casualties: Each of the casualties listed below must be treated in the plan as a separate
section comprised of various checklists or other means which will ensure that the master considers all appropriate
factors when addressing the specific casualty. These checklists must be tailored to the specific ship. In addition
to the checklists, specific personnel assignments for anticipated tasks must be identified. Reference to existing
fire control plans and muster lists is sufficient to identify personnel responsibilities in the following situations:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 8, 1993, the Department of Energy published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (58 FR 47326) regarding
energy conservation standards for three types of consumer products. In that Advance Notice, the Department stated
that it intended to consider more explicitly environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative
energy efficiency standards. Specifically, the Department expressed the intention to monetize the values of any
externalized benefits (or costs) if a sound analytic basis could be found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comments on whether and how the Department should evaluate and consider
environmental and energy security externalities that may be associated with alternative, candidate energy efficiency
standards. It has three specific aims: First, it requests focused public input on specific questions related to the
development and use of environmental and energy security externality values. Second, it outlines the Department's
preliminary thinking in several of these issue areas in order to provide stakeholders with maximum available information.
Finally, it solicits public identification of other issues relevant to the application of externality values in
the context of appliance standards, so that these may be considered in appliance standards rulemakings.

 created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program). The consumer products
subject to the Program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,
and freezers; dishwashers; clothes washers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditioners and central
air-conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; room
air conditioners; fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumer products classified
by the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) (section 322). To date, the Secretary has not so classified any additional
products.

Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy
Act, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments
of 1988, is referred to in this Supplemental Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III
is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq. Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National
Energy Conservation Policy Act only, is referred to as the National Energy Conservation Policy Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, the Program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and mandatory energy conservation
standards. DOE, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required to amend or
establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products (section 323). The purpose of the test
procedures is to provide for test results that reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating
costs of each of the covered products (section 323(b)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Trade Commission is required by the Act to prescribe rules governing the labeling of covered products
for which test procedures have been prescribed by DOE (section 324(a)). These rules require that each particular
model of a covered product bear a label that indicates its annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating
costs for other models of that product class (section 324(c)(1)). At the present time, there are Federal Trade Commission
rules requiring labels for the following products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers,
water heaters, freezers, refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, central air conditioners and central air-conditioning
heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979; 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987; and 54 FR
28031, July 5, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of 12 of the covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federal energy conservation standard (section
325(b)-(h)). The Act establishes effective dates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on the product,
and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by DOE within three to ten years, also depending on the product (Ibid.).
After the specified three- to ten-year period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product; however, the Secretary
may not prescribe any amended standard that increases the maximum allowable energy use or decreases the minimum required
energy efficiency of a covered product (section 325(l)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to television sets, the Act allows DOE to prescribe an applicable standard. (section 325(i)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three products (central air conditioners and central air-conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; and refrigerators,
refrigerator-freezers and freezers) are the subject of this rulemaking proceeding. For central air conditioners
and central air-conditioning heat pumps, the Act directs DOE to review each legislated standard for possible amendment
and to issue final rules as follows: for the seasonal energy efficiency ratio, no later than January 1, 1994, for units
manufactured after January 1, 1999; and for the heating seasonal performance factor, no later than January 1, 1994,
for units manufactured after January 1, 2002. For furnaces, the Act directs DOE to review the previously established
standard for small gas furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), the pending standard for mobile home furnaces, and
the legislated standards for all other covered furnaces for possible amendment and to issue final rules no later than
January 1, 1994, for units manufactured after January 1, 2002. For refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers,
the Act directs DOE to review the previous final rule, published November 17, 1989, for possible amendment and to issue
final rules no later than November 17, 1994, for units manufactured after January 1, 1998.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency
that is technologically feasible and economically justified (section 325(l)(2)(A)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether an energy conservation standard is economically
justified, it must first solicit comments on the proposed standard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE
must then determine that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens based, to the greatest extent practicable,
on a weighing of the following seven factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class)
compared to any increase in the price, initial charges, or maintenance expenses for the covered products that are
likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;

(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of
the standard;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules concerning testing, labeling, and standards on State
laws or regulations concerning such matters. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the
Act (section 327(a)&hyph;(c)). Exceptions to this general rule include the following: (1) State standards prescribed
or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to appliances produced before January 3, 1988, may remain in effect
until the applicable energy conservation standard begins (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards
which are more stringent than the applicable Federal standard (section 327(b)(2) and (e)) and certain building code
requirements for new construction, if certain criteria are met, are exempt from Federal preemption (sections 327(b)(3)
and (f)(1)&hyph;f(4)); (3) State regulations banning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters; and (4) State
standards for television sets effective on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal
standard for such products (sections 327(b)(6) and (c)).

In the Advance Notice to which this is a supplement, the Department indicated its intention more explicitly to consider
environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative energy efficiency standards. The
Department also noted that it would attempt to establish monetary values for externalities if a sound analytical
basis could be found for doing so.

 If the Department finds that a sound analytical basis exists, externalities may be incorporated in its analysis of
the net national benefits of alternative levels for the appliance efficiency standards covered by this rulemaking.

Externalities arise when the production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or confers benefits on
members of society external to the transaction that are not reflected in market prices. Environmental externalities
reflect the net national reductions in the adverse health effects or other damages associated with a reduction in
emissions of pollutants due to reductions in energy use as appliance efficiency is increased. Energy security externalities
reflect the net national reductions in energy security vulnerability associated with reduced reliance on external
energy sources.

&bull;The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis'' and ``Life Cycle Cost Analysis''
is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis: (a) Environmental external
costs; and (b) national security and balance of payments costs of increased/decreased oil consumption. (Sierra
Club, No. 43 at 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Ohio Office of the Consumers Council (OOCC) said that the consumer and utility analyses should include
monetization of externalities (environmental and security). Environmental externalities include sulfur oxides,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy
production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current trends in state utility regulations.
(OOCC, No. 60 at 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that the specification of monetary values for such environmental and energy security externalities
is a complex analytical effort, the Department is now supplementing its original Advance Notice for the three-product
rulemaking. This supplement provides an indication of the Department's intent in this area, identifies a range of
specific issues for public comment, and solicits identification of additional relevant issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the 1993 Advance Notice, the Department will attempt to develop analytically sound estimates of the
values of energy and environmental externalities. Provided that such values can be calculated, the Department intends
to use them in the analyses supporting the proposed and final rules establishing the standards for the products covered
by this notice. Estimates of such externalities would be considered in conjunction with the estimates of the total
net national benefits (or costs) of the standard, rather than in the analysis of consumer life-cycle costs. The life-cycle
cost analysis is intended to estimate the actual cost impacts on consumers. So long as externalities are not internalized,
individual consumers would not incur these benefits (or costs) directly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal cost, including the marginal cost of emission
controls, bears significantly on the size of the incremental adjustments to be made in the analysis in order to incorporate
environmental and energy security externalities into the assessment of net national benefits. The Department will
consider this relationship in determining the monetary values (if any) that should be placed on the external or marginal
environmental and energy benefits likely to result from appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of marginal
costs in this context also raises the question of whether the Department should use marginal electricity prices,
rather than estimates of average retail prices, for the calculation of net national benefits. The Department invites
comments on these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The potential impact of externalities on the determination of appliance efficiency standard levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the net national benefits estimated by the Department to result from appliance efficiency standards
have, in the past, excluded environmental and energy security externalities. The Department recognizes that the
approach taken for including these benefits in economic analyses of alternative appliance standards may vary, depending
on issues and variables that are specific to each standard under consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any estimates of environmental externalities would reflect ranges of uncertainties and be considered with other
national benefits associated with appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of externality values may
or may not influence the appliance efficiency standards selected for one or more appliances, depending on the quantitative
externality estimates and their relationship to the costs of higher efficiency and other elements of the analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The structure of the Department's analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to adopt a consistent approach in the treatment of externalities and the development of externality
values throughout these rulemakings. Therefore, this analysis starts with consideration of crosscutting issues
that are likely to bear on all standards and all types of externalities. This analysis of crosscutting questions provides
a framework for an analysis specific to each type of externality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion is framed around a series of focused issues for public comment. For convenience, the main
issues addressed are numbered consecutively throughout the entire notice. The numbered set provides a convenient
summary of the Department's current view regarding the issues that bear on the development and use of externality
values in the appliance standards analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues related to toxins, solid waste, and discharges affecting waste quality are not discussed in detail in this
notice. However, the Department invites comment on the potential importance of these emissions pathways to the determination
of externality values. Comments that are structured so as to address the same generic and externality-specific issues
raised in this notice, while also identifying other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly
helpful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the Department's current positions on many issues outlined below is not yet
firm. Responses to issues in this supplemental Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking could substantially alter
the Department's approach as the rulemaking progresses. Parties are also encouraged to raise, and comment on, additional
issues related to evaluating externalities and the use of such estimates in determining appliance standard levels.

Issue I: The relationship between existing environmental regulations or the use of externality values in the resource
planning process and the use of externality values in setting appliance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its current information, the Department does not believe that existing programs of environmental regulation
or existing uses of externality adders in the resource planning process preclude the use of externality values in
analyses considered in setting appliance standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relationship between externality adders and environmental regulation has been extensively studied. One key
finding is that proper use of externality adders does not turn on whether there is ``overcontrol'' or ``undercontrol''
in existing environmental regulation. Rather, taking the environmental control regime as given, the use of externality
adders can improve net national welfare by moving ``private'' decisionmaking within the existing regulatory regime
closer to ``social'' decisionmaking. For example, even if there is ``overcontrol'', it is still desirable that the
external impacts of differences in residual damage resulting from differing emissions levels associated with alternative
energy supply and end-use efficiency options be reflected in private decision-making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its current understanding, the Department also believes that existing uses of externality values in the
resource planning process do not present a barrier to the use of externality values in setting appliance standards.
The former are largely focused on bringing social costing considerations into capacity planning decisions, while
the latter is focused on reducing marginal electricity demand. The Department also notes that the use of externality
values in the capacity planning process is far from universal. According to a recent report of the Consumer Energy
Council of America Research Foundation (July 1993) only seven States and the Bonneville Power Administration use
quantitative externality values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 2: The impact if any, of existing environmental regulations on the determination of externality values for
use in the appliance standards analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its current understanding, the Department believes that the emission-reducing effects of existing programs
will affect externality values in two distinct ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the form of current environmental regulations can influence the net emissions impact of changes in energy
use associated with alternative appliance standards. This net emissions impact reflects both the direct impact
of changes in energy use_emissions associated with changes in primary energy either directly or to generate additional
electricity_and indirect impacts that may arise due to emission caps, offset requirements, non-attainment rules,
or other features of existing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if regulation takes a form that fully ``internalizes'' environmental externalities on all of the relevant
margins, including, in the case of electricity, not only utility decisions related to capacity, but those related
to dispatch and additions to capacity, as well as consumer demand decisions, the role for a supplemental externality
value is difficult to identify. An emission tax equal to marginal damage that was reflected in the market price is one
example of a policy instrument (albeit not one in widespread use) that would align private and social decision-making
on all three margins.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, current regulatory programs, whatever their form, have a significant influence on ambient concentrations
of pollutants. In general, the marginal damage associated with changes in net emissions due to alternative appliance
standards is sensitive to base level of pollutant loading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that existing programs, notably implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, could
result in significant changes in emissions loadings, and therefore change marginal damages, before the standards
promulgated pursuant to this rulemaking take effect. Economic growth over time would, in itself, tend to have the
opposite effect. The Department is currently considering how best to assess the marginal damages that should be associated
with any variation in emissions due to alternative appliance standards under these changing circumstances.

Issue 3: The geographic scope of environmental externalities that will be considered within the analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental externalities associated with energy-related emissions arise on all geographic scales. For example,
attainment of ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants is assessed at the level of an air quality control
region, generally a county or regional metropolitan area airshed. Concentrations of the criteria pollutants Nitrous

 emissions from the utility sector are important precursors, is a pollution issue in which regional transport plays
a major role. In some parts of the country, the same is also true for smog.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some issues involving energy-related emissions can even transcend national boundaries. Increasing attention
has turned to the possibility of climate change due to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Carbon dioxide, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is the single most important greenhouse
gas. Because atmospheric concentrations are driven by global emissions trends, concern with greenhouse gas emissions
is truly global in nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that emissions impacts on all geographic scales are relevant to the development of externality
values for use in the context of this rulemaking. However, because appliance efficiency standards are implemented
at the national level, environmental externalities should be evaluated from a net national perspective. Thus, for
example, based on our current understanding, if variation in a standard increases environmental damage in some areas
while reducing it in others, only the change in net damage to the nation would be relevant to the comparison of alternative
standards.

Issue 4: The role of damage-based and cost-based measures in the development of externality values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that both types of measures may play a role in estimating the net national benefits of selecting
alternative energy efficiency standards. The Department does not view itself as facing a choice between damage-based
and cost-based measures; rather, different measures are applicable in different cases. Three different cases are
described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of which case applies, in all cases the Department's aim is to use economic analyses to quantify the change
in net national benefits attributable to different appliance efficiency standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case 1: Changes in the efficiency standard selected will change national emission levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, selecting a more energy-efficient standard will reduce emissions into the environment. The Department
believes that damage-based measures are the preferred means of valuing the external effects of these reductions.
Damaged-based estimates are a direct measure of the external effect of variations in emissions levels. Reductions
in damage due to reduced emissions could encompass reduced human morbidity or illness, reduced property damage,
and/or improved environmental resources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that, for many pollutants, the literature on the damages caused by additional emissions
is not well developed. When information on damages is lacking, the Department may consider the use of information
related to the costs of emissions reduction in its effort to values externalities. The rationale for this approach
is that control costs convey information about social willingness-to-pay for emissions reduction. If legislative
and regulatory actions to limit emissions were economically rational (i.e., control measures were adopted in strictly
increasing order of marginal cost, stopping at the point where marginal control cost and marginal benefits were equated),
marginal control costs would provide an indirect measure of marginal damages. It is generally recognized, however,
that actual regulatory practice often diverges significantly from these conditions. Therefore, the Department
proposes to consider the use of control cost information to estimate externality values in situations where changes
in efficiency standards affect emission levels only in those cases where direct damage information is unavailable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case 2: The pollutant is subject to a binding emissions cap and changes in the efficiency standard selected will not
change national emission levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With a binding, national emissions cap in place, the aggregate level of emissions will not be affected by the appliance
efficiency standard selected. Because of the cap, there is no net change in emissions and, therefore, there are usually
no environmental externalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although in the case of an emissions cap there is usually no net environmental change on a national level, and therefore
no external environmental effect, the level of appliance efficiency standard selected may affect the net national
cost of meeting the emissions cap. For example, such a situation could arise from the need to meet progress requirements
under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In such a case, adoption of a less stringent efficiency standard could trigger
adjustments in the State Implementation Plan to impose additional controls on other sources to compensate for higher
emissions from electricity generation or fuel combustion. If a more stringent appliance standard were adopted,
States might avoid the imposition of additional controls on other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comments on whether and how the net change in environmental control costs attributable to variation
across alternative appliance standards should be included as an external effect. In this regard, DOE notes that the
effect on control costs of lower energy demand resulting from a more stringent appliance standard will vary according
to the structure of pre-existing regulatory programs. In the case of sulfur dioxide, for example, control obligations
of each emission source will remain fixed, but total compliance costs will fall. In the case of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and of VOCs, however, lower energy demand could reduce the extent to which State Implementation Plans must ratchet
down control requirements or expand the set of sources subject to emissions controls. The Department solicits comment
as to whether it is appropriate to differentiate these two situations, and how to calculate appropriate values of
net external cost savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is worth noting that a binding national emissions cap may become non-binding over time, for example, through technology
improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case 3: The pollutant is subject to regional emission caps and changes in the efficiency standard selected will change
emission levels in some areas of the country, but not others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For situations that fall into this category, DOE would propose to use a combination of the previous two cases for computing
external effects. Comments on how to combine these two approaches would be particularly helpful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 5: The use of cost information to provide a basis for determining society's willingness-to-pay for emissions
reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the preferred method for computing damages from a change in emissions is to rely on direct information
from damage-based studies. When damage-based studies are not available, however, the Department will consider
using control cost information to develop indirect estimates of externality values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that existing environmental programs may embody an extremely wide range of marginal costs for
emission reductions for the same pollutant. Costs within existing programs may vary by an order of magnitude or more
across regions, and even across sources in a given region. For example, some areas have failed to implement advanced
inspection and maintenance programs costing $100 per ton, while choosing to implement other standards to reduce
the same pollutants costing $3,000 to $10,000 per ton. One issue is whether the cost of the most expensive option adopted,
the least expensive option rejected, or some other value between the two should be considered as most representative
of revealed societal willingness-to-pay for an emissions reduction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Externality values used in state resource planning processes may provide another expression of revealed willingness-to-pay
for emissions reductions. The Department recognizes that the values used in resource planning processes are not
actually ``paid'' by either consumers or utilities. However, the use of these values appears to be directly analogous
to that contemplated by the Department in the setting of appliance standards. As noted above, only seven states applied
monetary externality values as of July 1993. Other jurisdictions applied qualitative externality values or no such
values at all. If externality values used by state regulators were to be considered as an expression of willingness-to-pay,
the Department would need to develop a national average measure that fairly characterizes a widely disparate set
of policies across the fifty states. The Department now believes that any such average should reflect differences
in the size of residential electricity markets across states. We solicit comment and suggestions regarding how averaging
across different policy types could be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue related to the possible use of externality values from the resource planning process is that some states
have applied them in a manner that allows for the application of offsets for some or all pollutants. With offsets, sources
can reduce the quantity of emissions to which externality values are applied by securing cost-effective emissions
reductions (or emissions sequestration), often at a cost that is far below the official externality value. In such
cases, the product of actual emissions and the official externality value would significantly overstate the ``effective''
externality adjustment actually used in the planning process. The Department is considering how, if at all, offset
policies in the application of ``official'' externality values in the resource planning process bear on the relevance
of these values to the setting of appliance standards, where offset opportunities would not be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 6: The role of damage assessments implicit in official decisions, such as the setting of ambient air quality
standards on damage estimates used in the appliance standards analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other Federal agencies have the statutory
responsibility to establish standards that reflect their assessment of damages from environmental externalities.
For example, EPA is required to set primary ambient air quality standards at levels that protect the public health,
including the health of sensitive populations, with an adequate margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the one hand, the Department could rely on existing standards in determining that emissions that do not contribute
to a standards violation do not impact human health in any way. Such reliance would not, of course, preclude the finding
of other types of environmental externalities, such as ecosystem or crop damages, for emissions that do not contribute
to standards violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Department, recognizing that appliance standards promulgated today will have their primary
effect five to ten years into the future, and that processes for setting environmental standards often engender significant
lags, might wish to consider studies pointing to adverse health effects at concentrations below currently applicable
standards in assessing health damages. How the Department could decide which evidence is credible and relevant without
duplicating the review process for setting environmental standards, which is clearly infeasible in terms of resource
requirements, is an open issue.

C. Utility Pricing and Incremental Externality Values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 7: The impact of the utility sector pricing practices on the use of externality adders in the appliance standards
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State utility regulatory commissions, motivated by the historical natural monopoly features of electric and natural
gas production, transportation, and distribution systems (although production systems are now increasingly seen
as allowing for competition), generally set regulated prices for electricity based on embedded rather than marginal
cost. Based on its present understanding, the Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal
cost can have a major bearing on the application of externality values in setting appliance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some background is helpful. In the absence of externalities, the theoretical economic conditions for social welfare
maximization are met when price equals marginal cost (a pricing condition enforced by competition in perfectly competitive
industries) and each consumer sets demand to equate this marginal cost with his/her own marginal private benefit
(or marginal utility). With externalities, this private market solution diverges from the necessary conditions
for a social optimum because external costs imposed on others are not reflected in decision-making. An appropriate
externality tax or adder can move private decision-making towards the social optimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within this context, consideration of the effects of a gap between price and marginal cost on the size of incremental
externality values is straightforward. Suppose, for example, that the price charged to end-users exceeds the marginal
private cost of producing and delivering electricity (or natural gas) to them. Then, in terms of private decision-making,
the positive gap by which price exceeds marginal cost would have the same effect as a tax in reducing electricity consumption
(and, implicitly, the emissions and the environmental externalities associated with production to meet incremental
demand).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because a positive difference between price and marginal cost functions as if it were a tax, it bears significantly
on the size of the additional externality adder the Department could justifiably employ when calculating the net
national benefit of alternative standards. For example, if the price of a marginal kilowatt were to exceed its marginal
cost by an amount equal to the value of the marginal externality damage, the pricing distortion in utility markets
and the externality would together create a situation where utility-customer decision-making would satisfy the
marginal conditions for social optimality without any further adjustments. An additional externality adder in
this situation would move away from the alignment of the private and social decision-making problems that motivates
concern with externalities in the first place. Based on this reasoning, DOE believes that application of an additional
externality adder in any situation where the price of a marginal kilowatt exceeds marginal cost by more than the value
of the marginal externality damage would be inconsistent with the objective of maximizing net national benefits.
In fact, for this latter case, one can envision arguments in favor of applying ``subtractors'' to utility rates used
in a calculation of net national benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that real-world utility pricing systems are quite complex. Many systems employ a fixed
connection or service charge, together with prices to meet incremental demand that may vary with the class of service,
time of day, or level of demand within a billing period. The analysis that supports the appliance standards rulemakings
does not reflect this complexity. Rather, a national average is used to represent current and forecasted consumer
prices. Based on its present information, the Department believes that the difference between this ``analysis price''
and marginal cost, rather than the difference between some true marginal price and marginal cost, is relevant to establishing
the gap between price and cost that bears on the incorporation of incremental externality values in the Department's
analysis. The Department seeks comment on alternatives to national averages that would better reflect local and
regional differences in consumer prices, as well as the other sources of price variation mentioned above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in some circumstances, the price facing end-users may be less than marginal cost. The same principles would
apply. Even ignoring externalities, prices below marginal cost encourage demand whose value to users is less than
the cost of production to meet it. To correct this situation and at the same time reflect externalities that may also
be present, it would be necessary to apply adders larger than the marginal damage from emissions associated with increased
energy demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the above, the relationship between price and marginal cost is clearly central to the determination of externality
values for use in setting appliance standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the Department recognizes that the price/marginal cost relationship can vary significantly across utilities.
Given the national applicability of appliance standards, we will seek to estimate a price/marginal cost relationship
that characterizes national average conditions. The rationale here is identical to that for focusing on national
average emission impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the relationship between price and marginal cost may vary across appliances because of the differences in
load shapes. For example, refrigerators that run continuously might be considered as contributing to ``base load'',
while air conditioners, which are used most intensively on hot afternoons, contribute primarily to ``peak load.''
The Department solicits comment on the need to develop information on the relationship between price and marginal
cost, relevant to each individual appliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there are several different marginal cost concepts. Short run marginal cost may, in systems with excess
capacity, include only fuel and incremental fuel and operation and maintenance costs. A long-run marginal cost concept
would also include the capital costs of generating facilities. To the extent that transmission and distribution
infrastructure costs also vary with marginal demand, these too can be included in marginal cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has not yet developed quantitative estimates of the relationship between price and marginal cost,
or determined which marginal cost concept is relevant to the question of externality adders. Evidence that would
be relevant to such a quantification includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gap between prices to industrial and residential consumers. Assuming that PUC's do not permit sales to industrial
users at prices below marginal cost (to do so would force residential and commercial customers to pick up 100 percent
of system fixed costs plus a portion of variable costs incurred for utility customers), the price of power to industrial
customers with an adjustment for any difference in marginal transmission and distribution costs between the residential
and industrial classes, could be taken as an upper bound on marginal supply costs to residential customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported national average electricity rates in 1992 for residential
and industrial consumers of $0.082 per kilowatt hour (kWh) and $0.048 per kilowatt hour (kWh), respectively. For
natural gas, EIA reports average rates in 1992 of $5.87 per thousand cubic feet and $2.82 per thousand cubic feet for
residential and industrial consumers, respectively.

(2) The capital and operating cost of incremental capacity. If meeting marginal demand requires new capacity, the
relevant marginal cost should include capacity cost. Current estimates of fully-loaded marginal costs for natural
gas combined cycle plants or pulverized coal plants are $0.035/kwh to $0.045/kwh. Again, marginal transmission
and distribution costs, if any, would also need to be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The marginal cost of dispatching the least efficient capacity in systems with excess capacity. One insight into
these costs can be gained by examining the operation and maintenance costs, on a per kilowatt basis, of combustion
turbines used for peaking purposes on some systems. Another perspective may be provided by the cost per kilowatt hour
of peak-shaving, demand-side management programs approved by various public utility regulatory commissions.
Public comments providing information related to these measurement approaches and their qualification would be
especially helpful.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this section, the Department builds on the crosscutting analysis presented above to outline an approach for analysis
of three types of energy-related emissions_sulfur oxides (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), nitrous oxides (NO

), and carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The focus on these three emission categories reflects a similar focus in recent U.S. legislation and international
agreements, most notably the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that there are other types of emissions, such as particulates, carbon monoxide, air toxins,
volatile organic compounds, solid wastes, and water discharges associated with energy use. Moreover, consideration
of the entire fuel cycle may reveal additional environmental externalities at the extraction or transportation
stages of the cycle. The Department welcomes comment and evidence regarding the importance of other types of externalities
that may arise through these and other emissions pathways that are not discussed below. Comments that are structured
so as to address the same generic- and externality- specific issues raised in this notice, while also identifying
other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly helpful. Each of the discussions of
the individual pollutants addresses a common set of issues as well as points specific to that emissions category.
The common issues are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 10: The local, regional, national, and global externalities associated with each type of emission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 11: The impact of a change in appliance efficiency standards on emissions, taking account of both direct impacts
and the indirect effects arising from existing regulatory structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 12: Evidence regarding the impact of change in emissions on the level of environmental damage to external parties.
Alternatively, if damage cannot be estimated directly, evidence regarding cost-based measures available as surrogates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 13: The impact and relevance of a change in appliance efficiency standards on the emission control obligations
of external parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is important to note that the relationship between price and marginal cost discussed as a crosscutting
issue will be relevant to the determination of whether an application of an incremental externality value is appropriate
in those cases where an environmental or energy security externality is identified.

a. Sulfur Dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sulfur dioxide emissions are implicated in environmental effects at the local, regional, and global level. At the
local level, sulfur dioxide is one of the criteria pollutants for which ambient air quality standards are established
under the Clean Air Act. At the regional level, sulfur dioxide is a precursor of acid rain, an issue addressed in Title
IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. At the global level, the 1992 Supplementary Scientific Assessment of Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change identifies sulfate aerosols as a potentially significant offset to greenhouse warming that
may be caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should focus on externalities
related to the acid precipitation pathway, and therefore on the regional effects. On the local level, there is already
widespread attainment with ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide. On the global level, the effect of sulfur
dioxide emissions as an offset to greenhouse warming remains speculative, and its value may be undercut by its extremely
short duration relative to warming from greenhouse gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acid precipitation issue is addressed in Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Beginning in the year
2000, its provisions implement a national cap on utility sulfur dioxide emissions of 8.9 million tons together with
a system of tradable allowances for allocating the burden of emissions reduction in a cost-effective manner. The
cap reflects a reduction of roughly 50 percent from 1980 emission levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects that the national emissions cap will be binding and, concomitantly, that allowance prices
will be positive. The Department notes that allowance transactions at positive prices are being recorded in increasing
number, and there are no known projections that suggest a non-binding cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 emissions at one location due to reductions in electricity demand would free up emissions allowances, the use of which
could increase allowable emissions at other locations, unless allowances were ``banked''. With no change in overall
emissions, the Department has no basis for assuming that alternative appliance standards would cause any change
in environmental damage levels. However, a net national environmental externality benefit could occur if the pattern
of emissions changes across alternative standards is one that systematically reallocates emissions from locations
where they inflict low marginal damage to locations where they inflict high marginal damage. Based on its current
information, the Department would assume that emissions reallocation from reduced electricity demand is environmentally
neutral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Department were to determine that emissions reallocation was not environmentally neutral, the development
of damage estimates would become an issue. In this case, the Department would rely heavily on the current criteria
document for sulfur dioxide, and on the report of the recent National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP),
a 10-year, $500 Million assessment effort. The Department welcomes comment on these and other potential sources
of damage information.

The Department also solicits comment on the possibility that the current binding national cap on SO

 emissions will become non-binding during the time period affected by appliance standards as a result of technology
improvements or cost reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to economic externalities, the Department notes that changes in electricity demand could affect the
market price of allowances. A change in allowance prices might affect the manner in which external parties elect to
meet their control obligations, but would not affect the obligations themselves.

 is also an acid rain precursor. Finally, changes in tropospheric ozone levels, by changing total column ozone, may
affect the amount of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation reaching the earth's surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should address all three
of these externality pathways. According to EPA (1993), the primary ambient air quality standard for tropospheric
ozone is violated more than one time per year in areas where 66 million Americans live. As noted in the discussion of
sulfur dioxide, acid precipitation is another issue of significant national and international concern. The potential
importance of the UVB issue is underlined by the fact that concern surrounding the potential damages from a projected
increase in UVB at the earth's surface was the major reason motivating the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's),
required by the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention and the CAAA of 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to acid precipitation, the Department would consider the same factors and information sources as outlined
above for sulfur dioxide. However, the regulatory structure for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions were insensitive to changes in electricity demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ambient air quality standards, the Department believes that three main issues must be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulatory structure and damages from emissions changes in attainment areas (those areas not violating

 transport from outside of an area on ambient air quality conditions in non-attainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the first and second points, the Department notes that roughly one-third of the nation's coal-fired
power plants and one-half of its gas- and oil-fired power plants are located in non-attainment areas. These are the
types of generating plants that, together with non-utility stationary sources and vehicles, are the sources of NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attainment areas: Abstracting from the issue of transport into non-attainment areas, the Department would rely
heavily on the information underlying the existing ambient standards for tropospheric ozone. These standards were
issued in early 1993. However, at the time the standards were issued, EPA noted that new studies, done after finalization
of the criteria document on which the standards were based, might suggest health effects at lower concentration levels.
The Department welcomes comment on whether and how these newer studies, which have yet to be formally evaluated by
the EPA, should be reflected in a damage assessment. The Department's damage assessment will also consider non-health
impacts drawing on studies included in the criteria document underlying the latest standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-attainment areas: In non-attainment areas, reductions in electricity demand affect the level of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in several ways. Any new generating plants in ozone non-attainment areas that are needed to meet growing
electricity demand would, under the regulatory structure of Title I of the Clean Air Act, be required to fully offset
their NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions before they could begin operation. Alternatively, changes in electricity demand could simply affect
the operation rate of existing plants, without triggering offset requirements for the operating company. In this
latter case, the initial effect would be an increase in emissions. However, Title I also specifies milestones, or
progress requirements, for emissions reduction in non-attainment areas. These requirements are applicable to
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in serious and severe non-attainment areas. If these progress requirements were binding, a change in the level of
emissions from the operation of existing power plants could affect the level of reductions that State Implementation
Plans would require from other types of sources in order to meet these requirements. From this perspective, a change
in appliance efficiency standards could change the control obligations of parties unrelated to appliance purchase
decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop its analysis on a national scale, DOE will try to develop information regarding the extent to which each
of the cases described above characterizes prevailing conditions. In order to develop an acceptable basis for estimating
the external benefits associated with NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions in both attainment and non-attainment areas, DOE will be seeking more information on the likely
marginal effects of appliance standards on net emissions and the marginal control costs required to meet non-attainment
area progress requirements. DOE will also be seeking better data on how damages and control costs might vary seasonally,
which may increase or decrease the estimated benefits of particular types of appliance efficiency standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, DOE recognizes the concern that transport of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from attainment areas may affect ozone concentrations in non-attainment areas, even though they do not
trigger offsets either through the new source program or via progress requirements. DOE welcomes information and
analysis regarding the importance of this issue for a national evaluation of externality damage, and recommended
approaches for incorporating it into the quantitative analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the effect of increased tropospheric ozone concentrations on the level of UVB at the surface, represents
a potentially favorable externality. The Department welcomes comment on the inclusion of this pathway in the externality
analysis, and on the use of information developed in the context of various rulemakings and assessments related to
the impacts of stratospheric ozone depletion to estimate marginal damages from reduced ozone.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that the potential for climate change due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, a global scale
issue, is the only relevant externality pathway for carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly, this is a high priority issue.
In 1992, the world community completed negotiations for a Framework Convention on Climate Change. This convention
has already been signed by 152 nations and should achieve a sufficient number of ramifications to enter into force
by the spring of 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the United States, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore have both identified the threat of climate change
as the environmental issue having the highest priority for the nation and the world. The President, on Earth Day 1993,
announced our nation's commitment to return its emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.
On October 19, 1993, the Administration released a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Climate Change Action Plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 outlining a set of specific programs to achieve that objective. However, unlike SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide are not presently subject to formal regulatory requirements
that go beyond emissions monitoring and reporting. The Administration's action plan does not include proposals
for any such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector are proportionally related to the level of use and type of fossil fuel.
For electricity, the Department intends to estimate the effect of a change in electricity use on carbon dioxide by
evaluating the ``average'' fuel mix used to supply marginal changes in electricity demand throughout the country.
The Department welcomes comments and suggestions regarding these calculations. While the absence of existing regulatory
programs and the simple relationships between primary energy use and emissions simplify the externality analysis
compared to that applicable to SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the effect of these concentrations on the both the global climate and the U.S. climate, and the timing of any such effects
are all highly uncertain. The effects of changes in climate on human activities and unmanaged ecosystems are even
more uncertain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the difficulties in estimating the impacts of global climate change, which is a necessary preliminary step
in estimating marginal damages from emissions changes, only the most rudimentary calculations have been made. Studies
made by the EPA (1989), Nordhaus (1991 and 1992) and Cline (1992) are particularly noteworthy. These authors candidly
admit the preliminary and often speculative nature of their calculations, and their inability to estimate impacts
for important categories of damages, such as impacts on unmanaged ecosystems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its present evaluation, the Department believes that the existing literature does not provide a sufficient
basis for developing estimates of marginal damage. Therefore, the Department is considering using revealed willingness-to-pay
for emissions reductions as a proxy to represent the social value of emissions reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Climate Change Action Plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represents the most aggressive national policy statement on emissions reductions to date. The major portion of energy-related
actions in the plan aim to increase end-use efficiency. These programs are generally voluntary in nature, and rely
on the attractive economics of the targeted energy-efficiency improvements to attract public participation. It
is projected that reprogramming federal expenditures of $1.9 billion into these areas will encourage private investments
of approximately $61 billion (undiscounted 1991 dollars) through the end of the decade. These investments are projected
to reduce energy costs (undiscounted 1991 dollars) by $60 billion through the end of the decade, and by an additional
$207 billion though 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the plan calls only for investments in efficiency projects that have a high rate of return, and generally does
not mandate these investments in the event that private parties judge them to be unattractive, it should not impose
any net costs on the private sector. The exclusion of measures that would impose net costs on the private sector could
itself suggest that, at present, the willingness to pay for emission reductions is at or near zero. The Department
notes, however, that the plan reflects only those actions taken to achieve a near-term objective. The President and
Vice-President have noted that the plan is only a first step. Moreover, it is not clear what amendments or protocols
may be made to the Climate Convention, and on what timescale. For these reasons, an evaluation of willingness-to-pay
implicit in the action plan may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the longer term willingness-to-pay for
sustained emissions reduction. The Department notes that estimates of the long-run cost of emissions reduction
varies widely, with bottom-up engineering models generally providing much lower cost estimates than top-down economic
models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also notes that utility regulators in several states employ quantitative externality values for
carbon dioxide in the resource planning process. The Department invites comments on the relevance of these values
to the present rulemaking. Comments that provide a basis for determining how a national average ``effective'' value
might be calculated, taking account of states with and without CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The literature on this subject identifies five main avenues through which energy security externalities can be generated.
Authors generally reach widely varying conclusions about their significance. DOE intends to study each of these
five areas and invites comments on their significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importance of several of the pathways listed below depends partially or wholly on the amount oil prices rise in
response to an oil supply disruption. Thus, as a part of its study of energy security externality values, DOE will consider
the likelihood of a disruption, its size, excess production capacity in other regions of the world, and how the price
shock associated with the disruption might be mitigated by drawing down strategic petroleum stockpiles. DOE invites
comments on the best approach to study these issues.

Gross Domestic Product losses resulting from oil price shocks:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Increased world oil prices caused by supply disruptions may cause macroeconomic shocks to the economy that result
in unemployment and Gross Domestic Product losses. Different studies reach different conclusions regarding the
significance of oil price shocks on macroeconomic performance. For example, a DOE study (1987) cites macroeconomic
stabilization as one justification for energy security policy. In contrast, a study by Bohi (1991) finds little,
if any, link between oil price shocks and macroeconomic performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If oil prices rise, then the rate of inflation in the economy increases. Policies to fight inflation can cause increased
unemployment and heighten Gross Domestic Product losses. Further, because many government payments are indexed
to inflation, oil price shocks can increase the size of the budget deficit. DOE intends to treat these inflationary
losses as part of the Gross Domestic Product loss component cited previously.

Monopsony price effects:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some economists argue that decreased domestic oil consumption will lower world oil prices and reduce payments for
imported oil. The reduced U.S. payments for imported oil benefit U.S. and foreign consumers, but they hurt domestic
and foreign producers. From a U.S.-centric accounting stance, this outcome would be beneficial because the U.S.
consumes more oil than it produces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adopting a U.S.-centric stance might be problematic in light of continuing U.S. policies to encourage free trade.
For example, U.S. exports of products other than oil to both oil exporting countries and other countries could be reduced
as the effects of a reduction in the value of oil imports work through the trading system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that monopsony-like arguments could be raised to justify externality values for many types of imported
goods, DOE intends to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality for it, while
excluding one for other products.

Terms of trade effect:

Decreased oil imports would improve the balance of trade and strengthen the U.S. dollar. This would leave U.S. consumers
unambiguously better off. This balance-of-trade effect is not considered in private decision-making. However,
like the monopsony effect, counting this as an externality raises broader issues regarding free trade. DOE intends
to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality value for it, while excluding
one for other products.

Financing of government strategic stockpiles and military operations associated with oil: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some analysts have suggested that the costs of stocking the strategic petroleum reserve and, more importantly, maintaining
the military power needed to minimize oil supply disruptions are an additional source of externalities. DOE intends
to study this source of externality in more detail, with particular emphasis on whether the size of the change in import
dependence that might be attributed to alternative appliance efficiency standards would have any effect on government
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these quantifiable aspects of energy security externalities, some analysts contend that reduced
oil consumption will increase U.S. flexibility in conducting foreign policy. DOE intends to consider this issue,
recognizing that any benefit here would again relate to the size of the impact of the efficiency standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 19: The impact of incremental appliance efficiency standards on oil consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A central issue in trying to estimate the energy security value to reduced oil imports is the quantitative effect of
incremental efficiency standards on domestic oil consumption. The appliances being considered in this rule affect
oil consumption either directly, as is the case with oil-fired furnaces, or indirectly by reducing the use of oil to
generate electricity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, according to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Energy Outlook for 1993 (AEO93), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
about 2 percent of total U.S. oil consumption was used for residential space heating. By 2010, the same source projects
that oil used for residential space heating will decrease significantly, and account for only about 1 percent of a
higher total oil consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current efficiency standard for residential oil-fired furnaces is 78 percent. Moving from the current standard
to 95 percent, for example would after complete stock replacement, reduce oil consumption in this category by less
than 20 percent, and by less if there is a ``rebound'' effect. Marginal changes in this standard could have only an extremely
small effect on total oil consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of appliance standards that affect electricity consumption, the amount by which oil consumption is reduced
depends upon the fuels used to generate electricity. According to the AEO93, about 4 percent of the primary energy
consumption used for electricity generation in 1990 was oil-based. That percentage is projected to remain approximately
constant through 2010. Because oil's share of electricity generation is so small, changes in appliance efficiency
standards for electric appliances will not significantly alter total oil consumption in the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the national fuel mix used in 1990, each kilowatt hour of electricity saved will reduce oil consumption by
0.000072 barrels. Given this ratio, each dollar of externality value attached to a barrel of oil translates into only
0.007 cents per kilowatt hour on a national average basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oil-based electricity might be significant in some regions of the country. Additionally, oil tends to be used for
peaking power. DOE intends to study whether regional and peak-load considerations might cause significant divergences
from the national ratio of barrels of oil per kilowatt hour. However, because the national ratio is so low, it seems
unlikely that even taking into account regional and peak-load considerations could result in large energy security
externality values for electric appliances even if a high per-barrel externality value were deemed appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE believes that the preponderant share of reduced oil consumption caused by incremental appliance efficiency
standards, will come from imports. The price of oil is set in a world market and domestic energy producers supply as
much oil as is profitable given that world price. Unless appliance efficiency standards significantly affect the
world oil price, domestic production will remain largely unchanged and imports will fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered, in several recent policy exercises, the impact of changes in domestic oil consumption
on world market prices. The change in price determines how reduced consumption is split between reduced imports and
reduced domestic production. Current modeling generally shows that domestic production falls by only about ten
percent of the decrease in domestic consumption. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service also
studied this issue in detail as a part of their 1992 5&hyph;Year Leasing Program, and reached similar conclusions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 18: The possibility of energy security externalities associated with non-oil fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not believe that there are comparable energy security externalities associated with fuels other
than oil. That is because non-oil fuels consumed in the U.S. are obtained primarily from domestic sources. The prices
of these fuels are primarily determined in national markets, and are not particularly susceptible to price spikes
caused by supply disruptions in other areas of the world. Because of these factors, DOE does not intend to consider
energy security externalities for fuels other than oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is important to note that the generic issue of the relationship between price and marginal cost outlined
in the Crosscutting Issues section must be considered in the determination of whether an application of an incremental
externality value is appropriate in those cases where an energy security externality related to the use of oil in electricity
generation is identified. However, given the competitive market structure of the fuel oil industry, the Department,
based on its current information, presumes that oil sold directly to residential end-users is competitively priced.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two
engine strut. This proposal is prompted by reports of chafing of the fire extinguishing tubes in a certain inboard
strut to wing area. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing of the fire extinguishing
tube; such chafing could cause cracking of the tube and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube,
which could prevent the proper distribution of the fire extinguisher agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 17, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;14&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8289 (57 FR 31433, July 16, 1994), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, to require repetitive inspections to detect damage of the tubes of the
engine fire extinguishing system in the number two and number three engine struts; replacement or repair, if necessary;
and reorientation of the clamp. That Ad also requires modification of the engine fire extinguishing system in the
number two and number three engine struts, which, when accomplished, terminates the inspection requirements. The
modification was required to be accomplished on all affected airplanes no later than February 20, 1993. That action
was prompted by multiple reports of the support clamps in the number two and number three engine struts chafing a hole
in the tubes of the engine fire extinguishing system. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent inadequate
distribution of the fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of chafing of the tubes and/or cracking of the rubber blocks
that are an integral part of the clamps in the inboard strut to wing area in the number two engine strut. (The tube and
the rubber blocks were installed as part of the modification required by AD 92&hyph;14&hyph;07.) As a result of the
chafing, one of the tubes on one airplane cracked approximately six inches from the forward end. Investigation revealed
that the cracked tube had a notch near the cracked area of the tube that had been formed due to contact with a ground stud.
This notch may have initiated the crack in the tube. Further investigation revealed that the rubber blocks, which
support the tubes, were cracked between the stand-off spacers and the tubes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cause of such chafing and cracking has been attributed to movement between the spacer and the tube. This movement
exceeded the flexibility of the rubber and stressed the rubber block, which subsequently pinched and tore the rubber
block of the clamp. Such pinching and tearing could cause the clamp to fail and could lead to chafing of the fir extinguishing
tube.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chafing of the fire extinguishing tube, if not corrected, could result in cracking of the fire extinguishing tube
and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube, which could prevent the proper distribution of the
fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;26A2226, dated June 30, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut. This modification entails
removing and replacing the fire extinguishing tube with a new, improved tube (for Group 1 and 2 airplanes); removing
and reinstalling the existing fire extinguishing tube (for Group 3 airplanes); and replacing the channel and rubber
blocks; and reworking the forward bracket (for Group 1, 2, and 3 airplanes). This modification would revise the geometry
of the rubber block and the tube, which would increase the flexibility of the rubber block and would increase the clearance
between the tube and the adjacent ground studs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are approximately 145 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 engines
of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected
by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions,
and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost
to the operators. Based on thee figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$330, or $165 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy
Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area new source review (NSR) SIP. The USEPA is proposing to
approve the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is also
proposing to remove references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter
Counties for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the
final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving these actions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views these as noncontroversial
actions and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final
rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated
in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and
all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not
institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do
so at this time.

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by PDB Broadcasting, permittee of a new FM station, Channel 299A,
Woodville, Mississippi, seeking the substitution of Channel 299C3 for Channel 299A at Woodville and modification
of PDB's construction permit to specify operation on the higher powered channel. To accommodate the allotment of
Channel 299C3 at Woodville, we also propose to substitute Channel 274A for Channel 257A at Jena, Louisiana, and the
modification of Station WJNA (FM)'s license to specify the change in channel; and to substitute Channel 257A for Channel
300A at Clayton, Louisiana. The license of Station WJNA(FM), Jena, Louisiana, has been ordered to show cause why its
license should not be modified as described above.

 NASA proposes to provide further implementation of the statutory goal to make at least eight percent of the funding
for prime contracts and subcontracts available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or controlled
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, which include women, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, and other minority educational institutions. These categories of entities listed in the applicable
statutes are collectively identified as ``designated entities.''

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule establishes major policies with respect to contracting and subcontracting with designated entities.
With respect to prime contracting, it ensures that designated entities are fully considered for awards. Also, the
consolidation or bundling of contract requirements is controlled. With respect to subcontracting, it requires
specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated
entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors, and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting
goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR
Subpart 19.7. NFS Subpart 1819.70 and the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 are substantially revised. A new subsection
is added to NFS 1815.608. NFS 1870.303, Appendix I, Chapter 301, is amended to cover proposal evaluation.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed, because it provides the NASA policy regarding contracting and subcontracting with designated
entities. Regarding prime contract awards, the policy ensures that designated entities are fully considered for
awards. Regarding subcontracting issues, the policy requires specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for
subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors,
and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting
plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR Subpart 19.7. Current regulations do not address these prime
contracting and subcontracting policies. The potential costs for this regulatory action are nominal and are not
quantifiable. Because the subcontracting goals are included in the contract, costs for contracting with or subcontracting
to designated entities would normally be charged to the Government. The potential benefits are the increased direct
awards or subcontracting awards to designated entities which will broaden the base of NASA contractors. The value
of increasing the contract and subcontract opportunities to designated entities cannot be measured, because it
involves not only increases to NASA's business base of qualified and eligible contractors but also additional opportunities
for designated entities to receive a fair proportion of NASA awards to the maximum extent practicable.

In all solicitations which contain the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76, NASA Subcontracting Goal, the contracting officer
is required to prescribe a mandatory goal for the use of ``designated entities'' as subcontractors (See 1819.7005).
Offers will be evaluated on the proposed designated entity subcontracting goal, in comparison to the goal specified
in the solicitation, and on the offeror's proposed method of achieving the goal. Evaluation of the designated entity
subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element under a management subfactor under
the Mission Suitability factor so that it may have an impact on the source selection decision.

require the NASA Administrator to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that at least eight percent (8%) of Federal
funding for prime and subcontracts awarded in support of authorized programs, including the space station by the
time operational status is obtained, be made available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (within the meaning of section 8(a)(5) and (6)
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a) (5) and (6)), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities
and minority educational institutions. For purposes of this subpart, socially and economically disadvantaged

General policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Congress has indicated its desire to increase the participation of designated entities in the aerospace industry,
particularly as NASA contractors and subcontractors. The agency's goal is to award to such entities at least 8% of
the funding provided for prime contracts and subcontracts in support of authorized programs by the end of fiscal year
1994. The participation of NASA prime contractors, through their subcontracting practices, is essential to meeting
this goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The 8% goal applies to the annual dollar obligations of the agency. It is not an absolute goal for each center or program
or an absolute percentage to be placed in each contract containing a subcontracting plan. While some procurement
requirements (contracts) offer subcontracting opportunities for designated entities equal to 8% of the contract
value, others will offer greater, and some less, subcontracting opportunities. The aggregate comprises the agency's
total accomplishment in response to the legislative mandate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Contracting officers must seek out designated entities as sources and give full consideration to these entities
to satisfy requirements in all NASA procurements. Since contracts with eligible 8(a) firms under the Small Business
Administration section 8(a) program count toward the attainment of NASA's goal, contracting officers must make
maximum use of this program in awarding prime contracts (see procedures set forth in (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 19.8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Existing contracts or options will normally not be reduced in scope or otherwise restructured to increase opportunities
for designated entities at the prime contract level. In rare instances, taking such action may be accomplished with
approval of the Associate Administrator for Procurement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to effecting a contracting consolidation valued at $5 million or more, including options, which will not be
exclusively reserved for small or 8(a) firms, an impact assessment on the effects of consolidation on present and
future contracting and subcontracting opportunities of designated entities shall be prepared by the center, submitted
to Headquarters Code HS, concurred in by Code K and the cognizant Associate Administrator, and approved by the Associate
Deputy Administrator (Technical).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Protests involving size status and those involving designated entity status for other than women-owned businesses
shall be referred to the U.S. Small Business Administration for handling. Protests to NASA regarding women-owned
businesses claiming designated entity status shall be resolved by the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Public Laws 101&hyph;144, 101&hyph;507, and 102&hyph;389 state that the status of a small business concern or
other organization as a designated entity is determined by whether the entity is owned or controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals, including women. To provide consistency with section 8(a)(4) of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)), NASA applies a restrictive interpretation of this legislation by requiring
ownership and control by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

percentage goal for using designated entities as subcontractors. This separate goal will not be entered on the subcontracting
plan but will be specified in the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76, NASA Subcontracting Goal. The total dollars planned
to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns stated in the subcontracting plan will be included
in determining the designated entity subcontracting goal. The designated entity subcontracting goal also includes
planned subcontracts with small business concerns owned and controlled by women, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, and other minority educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After a careful assessment of the statement of work associated with each procurement, contracting officers would
insert in solicitations that have subcontracting opportunities an appropriate subcontracting goal for designated
entities. The contracting officer shall confer with the small business specialist during the assessment stage since
the specialist has knowledge and information regarding the pool of designated entities available to fulfill the
subcontracting opportunities. The goals should be set at a level that can be reasonably achieved by the contractor
expending good faith efforts to use designated entities as subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The
designated entity subcontracting goals will be stated as mandatory goals in solicitations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Contracting officers shall include the mandatory designated entity subcontracting goal in the presolicitation
notice (see (FAR) 48 CFR 5.204) and in any draft Request for Proposal that is issued. The contracting officer and the
small business specialist will consider all comments received in response to either the presolicitation notice
or the draft Request for Proposal prior to determining the mandatory goal in the formal solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In negotiated acquisitions, an initial proposal will not be rejected as unacceptable solely as a result of an offeror
proposing a goal that is less than the mandatory goal. Subsequent to the evaluation of proposals, in which the proposed
goal shall be evaluated as a separate element under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor,
consistent with NFS 1815.608&hyph;72, the contracting officer shall negotiate with the apparently successful
offeror(s) to establish the designated entity subcontracting goal to be inserted in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If a bidder, in response to a sealed bid solicitation, takes exception to the specified mandatory subcontracting
goal, the bid shall not be rejected as nonresponsive. If the bidder is selected for award, the contracting officer
may request the bidder to offer a revised designated entity subcontracting goal by a specified date. If the bidder's
response indicates that the bidder does not intend to use its best efforts to provide the designated entities the maximum
practicable opportunity to participate in performance of the contract, the contracting officer may find the bidder
nonresponsible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In solicitations, proposals, and resulting contracts, the designated entity subcontracting goal should be
stated as a percentage of the total contract value rather than as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting
dollars. Subcontracting plans shall conform to the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, i.e., the goals included
in the plans shall be expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars. Also, SF 294 and SF
295 reports shall continue to be completed in accordance with the instructions on these forms.

(a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.219&hyph;73, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged
Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9. Insert in the
last sentence the number of calendar days after the contracting officer's request that the offeror must submit a complete
plan. When offerors are to include subcontracting plans in their initial offers as contemplated by (FAR) 48 CFR 19.705&hyph;2(d),
or if a noncompetitive solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the provision with its Alternate
I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;75, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged
Business Subcontracting Reporting, in solicitations and contracts containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9.
Those current contracts containing subcontracting plans and designated by NASA Headquarters (Code HC) shall be
amended to require quarterly submission of the SF 295.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In all solicitations and contracts which contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, Small Business and
Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76,
NASA Subcontracting Goal, when contracting by negotiation. In all solicitations and contracts which contain the
clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 with its
Alternate I, when contracting by sealed bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, and when the contract
value is expected to exceed the small purchase limitation, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76
with its Alternate II, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, and when the contract
value is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), and the contractor is a small business which
is not a designated entity, the contracting officer may use the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 instead of the clause at
1852.219&hyph;76 with its Alternate II. The basic clause should be used when the contracting officer determines
that the procurement offers subcontracting opportunities with designated entities.

a. Evaluation subfactors are the weighted areas within the Mission Suitability factor that further identify, for
proposal preparation and evaluation purposes, the content of the factor. Examples of Mission Suitability subfactors
found by experience to be relevant to many procurements are: understanding of the Requirement; Management Plan;
Key Personnel; Corporate or Company Resources; and Excellence of Proposed Design for hardware procurements. Citation
of these specific subfactors is not intended to be restrictive or all inclusive. However, as stated in NFS 1815.608&hyph;72,
evaluation of the designated entities subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element
under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor. The nature and thrust of the requirements and
objectives of the procurement may logically call for the use of some subfactors titled and described in a somewhat
different manner than those described below:

e. (1) In structuring evaluation subfactors and elements, emphasis should be placed on identification of significant
discriminators, or ``key swingers''_the essential information required to support a source selection decision.
Too many subfactors and elements are detrimental to effective evaluation of proposals and may result in a leveling
or averaging out of scores over all proposals. To avoid this negative effect, the number of subfactors under Mission
Suitability shall be no more than 4 and the number of elements no more than 8 except for the separate evaluation of designated
entities either as a separate element or a separate subfactor under Mission Suitability (See NFS 1815.608&hyph;72).
Other evaluation factors shall also be limited to only essential subfactors and elements. Further, care should be
taken to avoid overlap and redundancy by clearly defining each evaluation subfactor and element. Avoiding such overlap
assures an offeror is not scored in two or more areas for the same work.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 29, 1994, the President signed the ``Hazardous Materials Transportation Authorization Act of 1994'' (the
Act). Section 122 of the Act requires RSPA to examine requirements that pertain to open head fiber drum packaging in
domestic transportation. Specifically, RSPA is to determine whether there are standards other than the performance-based
standards adopted under RSPA's rulemaking Docket No. HM&hyph;181, that will provide an equal or greater level of
safety for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials. The purpose of this ANPRM is to solicit comments and
proposals for alternate standards for open head fiber drum packaging.

SEC. 122. USE OF FIBER DRUM PACKAGING. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) INITIATION OF RULEMAKING PROCEEDING._Not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of Transportation shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether the requirements of
section 5103(b) of title 49, United States Code (relating to regulations for safe transportation) as they pertain
to open head fiber drum packaging can be met for the domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials (with respect
to those classifications of liquid hazardous materials transported by such drums pursuant to regulations in effect
on September 30, 1991) with standards other than the performance-oriented packaging standards adopted under docket
number HM&hyph;181 contained in part 178 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ISSUANCE OF STANDARDS._If the Secretary of Transportation determines, as a result of the rulemaking proceeding

Detailed comments and proposals are requested that will assist RSPA in developing an appropriate regulatory proposal
consistent with the requirement quoted above. Of particular importance is the determination called for in paragraph
(b) of Section 122 that a packaging standard to be adopted provide an equal or greater level of safety for domestic transportation
of liquid hazardous materials than would be provided if the performance-oriented packaging standards specified
in 49 CFR part 178 subparts L and M were applied. Any interested person is invited to present a proposal, preferably
in the form of a draft standard, that would assist RSPA in accomplishing the intended effect of this law. The proposal
should include a methodology for evaluating comparative levels of safety and estimates, where available, of cost
differences between present and proposed packaging.

In addition, comments are invited on the issue of whether alternate standards for open head fiber drums should be limited
to domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials. If packagings authorized by alternate standards would
cost less than the performance standard packaging adopted under HM&hyph;181, but were not authorized for international
shipments, an unfair competition issue could be raised in relation to international trade agreements.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of installing a manual device that motorists could use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivate the front passenger-side air bag in a vehicle without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rear seats for the purpose of allowing them to place rear-facing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infant restraints in the front seat. NHTSA research indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rear-facing infant restraints should not be placed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This poses a problem because manufacturers are beginning to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
install, and soon will be required to install, passenger-side air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bags in passenger cars and light trucks, some of which have only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front seats.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing a manual device (hereafter referred to as a ``cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device'') that motorists could use to deactivate the front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag in a vehicle without rear seats for the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of allowing them to place rear-facing infant restraints in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front seat. (``Rear-facing infant restraint,'' as used in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, refers to an infant restraint system (except a car bed) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is positioned in a vehicle so that the restrained infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faces the rear of the vehicle.) NHTSA is issuing this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because one particular type of child restraint, i.e., a rear-facing infant restraint, should not be placed in the
front seat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag. This poses a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem because manufacturers are beginning to install, and soon will be required to install, passenger air bags
in vehicles, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which have only front seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 208, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupant Crash Protection, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers must install air bags to satisfy the standard's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic crash protection requirements (58 FR 46551). This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was required by 49 U.S.C. 30127 (recently codified and previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited as Section 2508 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficiency Act of 1991). These requirements for driver and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bags are phased-in for both passenger cars and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other vehicles. The phase-in percentage for passenger cars is 95 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by model year 1997, and all passenger cars beginning with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year 1998. The phase-in percentage for trucks, buses, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multipurpose passenger vehicles (other than walk-in van-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trucks and vehicles designed to be exclusively sold to the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds or less (collectively referred to as ``light trucks'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the remainder of this preamble) is 80 percent by model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1998 and all light trucks beginning with model year 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has already released several documents and completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several rulemaking actions addressing the air bag/infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint interaction problem. Based on the preliminary results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the testing done regarding this problem, NHTSA issued a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Advisory on December 10, 1991, warning owners of rear-facing infant restraints not to use such a restraint
in the front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since issuing the 1991 Consumer Advisory, NHTSA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intensified its efforts to work closely and cooperatively with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties on this issue. For example, NHTSA has worked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to bring about a better understanding of rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint/air bag interaction through the auspices of the Society 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and its technical committees on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child safety issues. As a result of mutual concerns on the part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of government and industry, the SAE was able to publish consensus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines dealing broadly with the interaction of child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint systems (including rear-facing infant restraints) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bags. The agency worked with State and local governments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disseminate the information about the latest, mutually arrived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at, recommendations concerning rear-facing infant restraint/air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bag interaction. NHTSA has also worked with the American Academy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Pediatrics (AAP), a group of doctors who specialize in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care of children. As a result, the AAP has disseminated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warnings about air bags and rear-facing infant restraints to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40,000 members through its newsletter and Family Shopping Guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Car Seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the agency has reemphasized its commitment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educating the public on this issue. In April 1992, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reissued its Consumer Information Bulletin, ``Transporting Your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children Safely.'' This bulletin provides several pages of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines on the use of child restraints in vehicles, including a chart depicting the optimum restraint type for
various sizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and weights for children. For example, the bulletin recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that from birth to 9&hyph;12 months or 20 pounds, a rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint be used. The bulletin also states: ``Rear-facing child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety seats should always go in the rear seat in cars equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with passenger-side air bags.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1992, based on the final results of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned above, NHTSA published a final report describing child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint/passenger air bag interactions (Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restraint/Passenger Air Bag Interaction Strategies, DOT HS 808&hyph;004, October 1992). The report concluded
that rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints should not be placed in the front seat of a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a passenger air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the October 1992 final report, NHTSA amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several safety standards to require warnings concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of air bags and rear-facing infant restraints. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the September 1993 final rule, as described above, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required that specified information, including information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proper placement of rear-facing infant restraints, be placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on labels in vehicles equipped with air bags. This warning label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be on the sun visor of any vehicle equipped with an air bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured after September 1, 1994. It also required that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional, more detailed information about air bags be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the owner's manual. Consumers were again cautioned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department not to use rear-facing infant restraints in seating positions protected by air bags in an October 28, 1993
news 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 16, 1994, the agency took a further step to try 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to alert parents to the issue of air bag/rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint interaction. It published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule amending Standard No. 213, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Child Restraint Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 7643). The amended Standard No. 213 requires that the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label for a rear-facing infant restraint include a warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against using the restraint in any vehicle seating position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with an air bag. It also requires that the printed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions for a rear-facing infant restraint include safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about air bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Believing that steps in addition to providing consumers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information were needed, members of the American Automobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association (AAMA) met with NHTSA on January 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. AAMA asked for the meeting to explore the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing an air bag cutoff device to allow rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints to be placed in air bag-equipped passenger seating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions. AAMA representatives discussed the general concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an air bag cutoff device, which could be either automatic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual. However, the representatives emphasized that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry is not quite ready to install automatic devices because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic cutoff technology is not yet ready for production. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the meeting, AAMA asked whether Standard No. 208 would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such devices and, if not permitted, whether the agency would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider initiating rulemaking to permit such devices.

II. Scope of this Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is concerned that despite its efforts to provide warnings to not place an infant in a rear-facing infant restraint
in the right front seat of a vehicle that has a passenger air bag, these warnings will provide minimal benefit if a parent
chooses to transport his/her infant in a vehicle that is physically unable to accommodate a child any place other than
the front seat, e.g., a vehicle that has no rear seat. Examples of such vehicles are a two-seater sports car and a light
duty truck with only a front seat. It is exclusively for this minority of vehicles that this notice is intended. NHTSA
believes that allowing manufacturers the option to install a manual cutoff device would not unduly diminish the ability
of these vehicles to provide crash protection to the adult population and would avoid the potential problem of air
bag/infant seat interaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Legality of Air Bag Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the January 1994 meeting with AAMA, the agency examined whether Standard No. 208 currently permits a vehicle
to be equipped with an air bag cutoff device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 208 currently requires the front outboard seating positions in passenger cars and light trucks to be
equipped with automatic crash protection systems which protect their occupants by means that require no action by
vehicle occupants. Compliance with the automatic crash protection requirements of Standard No. 208 is determined
in a dynamic crash test. That is, a vehicle must comply with specified injury criteria, as measured on a test dummy,
in a 30 mph barrier crash test. The two types of automatic crash protection currently offered are automatic safety
belts (whose automatic nature helps to assure belt use) and air bags (which supplement safety belts and offer some
protection even when safety belts are not used). The September 1993 final rule will require manufacturers to comply
with the automatic crash protection requirements by installing air bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two types of cutoff devices are possible. The first type involves manual technology such as an ``on-off'' switch to
disable the operation of the passenger air bag by moving the switch to the ``OFF'' position. To reactivate, the switch
is then moved to the ``ON'' position. This reactivation may take place manually or it may occur automatically, e.g.,
after deactivation the system reactivates the next time that the ignition is turned on or when a door is opened. The
second type of cutoff device is one that automatically deactivates and reactivates the air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In past agency interpretations of the safety standards, NHTSA has stated that if (1) there are two possible conditions
during a compliance test (e.g., whether a particular device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position), and (2) the standard
does not specify which test condition is to be used, and (3) the language of the standard as a whole and the standard's
purpose do not imply a limit that would make one of those conditions inappropriate, there is a presumption that the
requirements have to be met in both test conditions.

With regard to automatic cutoff devices, the agency expects that manufacturers would design these devices so that
they would automatically ensure that the front passenger air bag is activated during the barrier crash test because
a 50th percentile adult male dummy is in the seat. Thus, there would not be two possible test conditions under those
circumstances. Therefore, if so designed, automatic cutoff devices would be allowed by Standard No. 208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to manual cutoff devices, two test conditions are possible. In one, the device is in the ``ON'' position
and the air bag is deactivated. In the other, the device is in the ``OFF'' position and the air bag is activated. The position
of a cutoff device is not specified in Standard No. 208, so the presumption arises that the Standard must be met regardless
of whether the device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, before reaching such a conclusion, the agency considers the language and purpose of the standard to see if
any limits on the test condition are implied. In the past, the agency has found such limits when one or more of the possible
conditions could not occur under normal driving conditions. The purpose of Standard No. 208 is for a vehicle to provide
automatic protection for vehicle occupants at all times when the vehicle is operating. Therefore, if the cutoff device
could be used when the vehicle is being operated, there is no implied limit on the position of the device during the test.
Since the injury criteria presumably would not be met when the air bag has been deactivated, the device would result
in a noncompliance with Standard No. 208. Therefore, the agency concludes that manual cutoff devices are not currently
permitted by Standard No. 208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above conclusion about manual cutoff devices applies only to vehicles that comply with the automatic protection
requirement by means of air bags. If a vehicle is voluntarily equipped with air bags, as some light trucks are, the installation
of a manual cutoff device is permitted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Decision to Allow Manual Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that a regulatory dilemma now exists because drivers of two-seater vehicles, i.e., vehicles which
have no designated rear seating positions, might be forced to ignore the cautions against placing an infant in the
front seat. Although some manufacturers may be able to devise an air bag system that would accommodate an infant in
a rear-facing infant restraint placed in close proximity to the dashboard of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air
bag, concerns voiced by the AAMA indicate that, in general, most vehicle manufacturers are concerned that existing
air bag designs do not currently provide the special type of protection needed to avoid injury to infants in rear-facing
infant restraints placed on the front seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the automatic technologies now under consideration appear too immature for immediate application to the
problem, the agency is proposing to amend Standard No. 208 to permit a manual cutoff device. NHTSA has concluded that
manual cutoff devices should be optional; they should not be mandated. A mandatory installation requirement could
penalize manufacturers that have produced, or intend to produce, a passenger air bag that is not harmful to infants
in rear-facing infant restraints. The agency believes that a mandatory requirement would needlessly stifle innovations
and could impede future advances in air bag technology. In addition, the agency believes that some vehicles with only
one row of seats may allow the seat to be moved far enough rearward so that the combination of air bag type and design and
vehicle seat position does not pose a threat to a child in a rear-facing infant restraint. Thus, a cutoff device would
not be necessary in the vehicle.

V. Details of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Affected Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to allow manual cutoff devices in passenger cars and light trucks since, as noted above, these vehicles
are required to have passenger air bags by the late 1990s. NHTSA has also tentatively concluded that manual cutoff
devices should be allowed only in passenger cars and light trucks which do not have forward-facing rear seats. If vehicles
are equipped with at least one rear seating position, that position can be used for a rear-facing infant restraint.
Even in vehicles without air bags, NHTSA recommends the rear seat as the optimum location for any child restraint.
Accordingly, NHTSA does not believe that manual cutoff devices should be allowed in vehicles with a forward-facing
rear seat.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require the use of a key to activate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cutoff device. This would make the device simple and easy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, but still require conscious thought and deliberate action on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the part of the user. The agency is proposing use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignition key to ensure that the driver of the vehicle is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person most likely to activate the cutoff device, and thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the likelihood of accidental activation. This approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is similar to that used in Standard No. 118, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Power Operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Window, Partition and Roof Panel Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to ensure the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of electrically operated devices. NHTSA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on mandating the use of the ignition key. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests comments on other means that would guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the inadvertent deactivation of the air bag, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoiding the possible complexity or inconvenience of the ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key based approach. Examples of other means include a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key from the ignition key, ``keyless'' entry technology responding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to personal identification numbers, the use of ``protected'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switches that require removing or re-positioning a special safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cap in two or more steps, or other such devices. NHTSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider all comments regarding the means to deactivate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag, and will adopt the most practicable approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible which is consistent with the philosophy that the device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be as simple and easy to use as possible, consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of preventing inadvertent deactivation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Air Bag Reactivation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require that manual cutoff devices be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed so that, once the cutoff device has been used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivate the air bag, the air bag will remain deactivated until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is manually reactivated. Mandating manual reactivation would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that once an air bag has been deactivated for the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an infant being transported in a rear-facing child restraint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the front seat, it would remain deactivated for subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trips with the child. NHTSA is concerned, for example, that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it instead allowed a manually deactivated air bag to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically reactivated, motorists making stop-and-go shopping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trips with infants might forget, after making one of their stops, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the air bag has been automatically reactivated and needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be manually deactivated again. The infants would then be at risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the vehicles were involved in crashes that deployed the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the agency is concerned that the air bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be operational whenever it is needed by a non-infant occupant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an attempt to ensure that air bag protection would be ready 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when needed, NHTSA also proposes to require a yellow warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light which would be clearly visible to the driver and any adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger (see Section D, Warning Light, below). It would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illuminate the words, ``AIR BAG OFF,'' whenever the air bag has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been manually deactivated. This warning light would serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reminder that the cutoff device should be reset whenever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle is no longer carrying an infant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding its proposal to require that manually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivated air bags reactivate by manual means only, NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether it should address the problem of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring both infant and non-infant safety by mandating that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manually deactivated air bag be automatically reactivated upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the occurrence of some subsequent event. The subsequent event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that triggers the automatic reactivation of the air bag could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next restarting of the vehicle. However, such a design could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose an unnecessary burden and risk in the example given above of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motorists making stop-and-go shopping trips. The motorists must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restart their vehicles numerous times on such trips. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of that fact and the automatic reactivation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag each time the vehicles are restarted would multiply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasions on which the motorists might forget to protect their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants by deactivating the air bag. To address this problem, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests comments on whether, if it were to adopt a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for automatic reactivation, it should qualify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement further, by requiring that the air bag be reactivated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only when the restarting of the vehicle occurs after the ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been off for more than some minimum period, perhaps a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of several hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate decision whether to mandate manual or automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivation of the air bag will depend in large measure on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's assessment of the relative effects of each method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivation on the safety of the infant and non-infant occupants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the front right passenger seating position in the vehicles affected by this rulemaking. Using data from the National

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accident Sampling System (NASS) and Fatal Accident Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System (FARS), the agency has attempted to quantify the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety trade-offs in its preliminary regulatory evaluation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking. NHTSA seeks comments and information that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the agency to refine its estimates of those trade-offs.

D. Warning Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require a telltale light on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dashboard that is clearly visible from both the driver and front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger seating positions and that is illuminated whenever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag has been deactivated by means of the cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device. This light would be separate from the air bag readiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator already required by Standard No. 208. NHTSA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that the color of the telltale be yellow, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
words ``AIR BAG OFF'' clearly visible on the telltale when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger side air bag has been deactivated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that the indicator should be visible to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driver as a reminder that the passenger air bag is, or is not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning. NHTSA believes that the indicator should be also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible from the passenger seating position as a warning to non-infant occupants that they are not protected by their
air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency is requiring a warning light that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible to the passenger, its effectiveness may be limited by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a passenger actually looks at, or for, the light, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understands its message. The agency seeks comment on whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental or additional warning for passengers would minimize instances in which the air bag was unintentionally
not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is concerned that the level of illumination should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the ambient light condition, and is therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that the warning light indicator provide at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of brightness, one of which is barely discernible to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driver who has adapted to dark ambient roadway conditions. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, NHTSA is specifying that the warning light indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not be adjustable under any driving condition to a level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is invisible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Air Bag Readiness Indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, S4.5.2 of FMVSS No. 208 requires that every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle equipped with an air bag also be equipped with an air bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readiness indicator that informs the driver about the operational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status of the air bag system. Specifically, S4.5.2 states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An occupant protection system that deploys in the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a crash shall have a monitoring system with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readiness indicator. The indicator shall monitor its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own readiness and shall be clearly visible from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driver's designated seating position. *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is not aware of any manufacturer which complies with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement by installing separate readiness indicators, one for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the driver air bag and another for the passenger air bag. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single readiness indicator for two air bags were used on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle with an air bag cutoff device, the indicator would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate the non-functioning of an air bag whenever the passenger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag was deactivated. NHTSA is concerned that, under those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, the driver would have no means of knowing the operational status of the driver air bag. NHTSA considered

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend S4.5.2 to require separate readiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators for the driver and passenger side air bags. Instead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is proposing to amend S4.5.2 to limit the operation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single readiness indicator when the cutoff device is ``on'' so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the indicator monitors only the air bag that is not deactivated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., the driver air bag. When the cutoff device is ``off,'' the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag would be activated, and the readiness indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would monitor the readiness of both the driver air bag and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag.

NHTSA is also proposing to require that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include information concerning the cutoff device in the owner's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual. NHTSA is not proposing specific language which must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the owner's manual. NHTSA is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner's manual to include instructions on the operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cutoff device, a statement that the cutoff device should only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used when a rear-facing infant restraint is installed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front passenger seating position, and a warning about the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of using the cutoff device at other times.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seats that convert from forward-facing to rear-facing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the language of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels need not be amended. Manufacturers of child restraint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems are required to state in the printed instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanying the restraint that the safest location for any child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint is in the rear seat, regardless of whether the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has an air bag. In addition, NHTSA is concerned that changing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the language to clarify that the warning does not apply when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag can be deactivated will lessen the impact of the message 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the public. Since not all vehicles may be equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff devices, NHTSA is concerned that the result of lessening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact of the message would be the placement of an infant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a seating position with an air bag that cannot be deactivated.

VI. Phase-out of Manual Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has tentatively concluded that use of manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff devices should not be permitted indefinitely. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has also tentatively concluded that vehicles with air bags having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual cutoff devices should not be counted toward compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the phase-in for air bags. Further, manual cutoff devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be prohibited in all passenger cars manufactured on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 1, 1997, and all light trucks manufactured on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 1, 1998. These are the dates on which 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent compliance is required by 49 U.S.C. 30127. To implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposals, NHTSA would amend S4.1.5.1(b)'s definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ``inflatable restraint system,'' a term used in the paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the air bag requirements, to state that it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an air bag that can be deactivated by a manual cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This several year period would give manufacturers time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop and introduce automatic devices. Automatic technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reduce the potential problem with either intentional or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental misuse of these devices to deactivate an air bag at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times other than when a rear-facing infant restraint is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seat. The agency is optimistic that new automatic sensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology will soon be available to deactivate an air bag in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain situations, or to modify the deployment rate of the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bag according to the speed of the impact or the distance between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the air bag and the occupant to be protected. NHTSA encourages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to continue and accelerate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their efforts to develop such technology.

VII. Automatic Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, NHTSA has concluded that Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 208 currently allows automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether the agency should regulate automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff devices. As part of this rulemaking proceeding, NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether any or all of the proposals in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice relating to warning lights, readiness indicators, owner's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals, and labels should also apply to vehicles equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA believes that the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, in developing automatic cutoff devices, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempt to guard against the possibility of air bags being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically deactivated when they should be providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Nevertheless, for the purpose of possible future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, the agency requests comments on the necessity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's taking steps to ensure that air bag protection remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activated at all appropriate times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Consumer Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency actively works with consumer groups to promote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child safety, and has been instrumental in reversing the stance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long held by the American Academy of Pediatrics that infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints may be placed in the front seat. Additional consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education is a necessary ingredient toward a successful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment of the philosophy embodied in this rulemaking. Toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that end, NHTSA will work actively with the interested parties to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further promote infant safety and to minimize any risk to infants from passenger side air bag. NHTSA invites comments
in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Proposed Effective Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
X. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been determined to be ``significant'' under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absent this rulemaking, and given a vehicle population in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which all cars and light trucks are equipped with driver and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bags, an estimated 1,050 air bag deployments a year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will occur in pickup trucks and two-seater vehicles when a front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger seat is occupied by an infant in a rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seat. The level of the injuries resulting from these deployments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are uncertain, but may well be severe. In an effort to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential for safety trade-offs resulting from the failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivate the air bag after it has been deactivated for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit of infant passengers, the agency estimated that only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about one percent of the vehicles which would be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a cutoff device are likely to be carrying an infant. If one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes for the purpose of analysis that the older occupants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent of these vehicles did not reactivate the air bag for the benefit of non-infant passengers, approximately
3 occupants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are at least one year old may receive AIS 2&hyph;5 (survivable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries. In addition, for every one percent of all affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles in which the older occupants deliberately turn off the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag, 1&hyph;3 fatalities and 23&hyph;32 additional injuries could occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year. Since the agency believes that the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles in which the passenger air bag is inadvertently or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberately deactivated would be fairly small, the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants who would avoid potentially serious injury far exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of non-infants who might be injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA estimates that the per vehicle price impact for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of a passenger air bag cutoff device is $10.15 in 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollars. This cost reflects a cost of $5.15 for the cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and $5.00 for the light sensor that allows the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light to have variable levels of brightness. NHTSA has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated the annual costs of this proposal, as that figure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent on the number of vehicles voluntarily equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual cutoff devices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A preliminary regulatory evaluation has been prepared for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking. A more detailed explanation of the costs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits can be found in that document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. As explained above, NHTSA does not anticipate a significant economic impact
from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant impact on the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this proposed rule would not have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

F. Civil Justice Reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission
of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before parties may file suit in court.

XI. Submission of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arguments in a concise fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission, including purportedly confidential business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the street address given above, and seven copies from which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information specified in the agency's confidential business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received before the close of business on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered, and will be available for examination in the docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date
will also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further rulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to file relevant information as it becomes available in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested persons continue to examine the docket for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postcard by mail.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, (collectively, the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial supervisory agencies or agencies) propose to revise their regulations concerning the Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA). The agencies published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on this issue on December 21, 1993 (December
proposal). The revised proposal published today reflects comments received on the December proposal and the agencies'
further internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the CRA regulations is to implement the continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and affirmative obligation of regulated financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities,
including low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations and to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on how the agencies assess the performance of institutions in meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would provide guidance to financial institutions on the nature and extent of their CRA obligation
and the methods by which the obligation will be assessed and enforced. The proposed procedures seek to emphasize performance
rather than process, promote consistency in assessments, permit more effective enforcement against institutions
with poor performance, and reduce unnecessary compliance burden while stimulating improved performance. As compared
to the December proposal, the revised proposal broadens the examination of performance, more explicitly considers
community development activities, and makes other modifications and clarifications.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal financial supervisory agencies are jointly proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revise their regulations implementing the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed regulations would replace the existing regulations in their entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRA is designed to promote affirmative and ongoing efforts by regulated financial institutions to help meet the
credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe
and sound operations. Despite the CRA's notable successes, bank and thrift industry, community, consumer and other
groups maintain that its full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential has not been realized, in large part, because compliance efforts have focused on process rather than performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with a request by the President, the Federal financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory agencies have undertaken a comprehensive effort to reform their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation standards and examination procedures. The proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would implement one part of this reform effort by substituting a new system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would rate institutions based on their actual performance in helping to meet community credit needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and use of enforcement procedures. These efforts should produce a CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment process that is less burdensome for many institutions yet yields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better results for the local communities the law is intended to benefit.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1977, the Congress enacted the CRA to encourage banks and thrifts to help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income
communities, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. In the CRA, the Congress found that regulated financial
institutions are required to demonstrate that their deposit facilities serve the convenience and needs of the communities
in which they are chartered to do business, and that the convenience and needs of communities include the need for credit
as well as deposit services. The CRA has come to play an increasingly important role in improving access to credit among
under-served communities_both rural and urban_across the country. Under the impetus of the CRA, many banks and thrifts
opened new branches, provided expanded services, and made substantial commitments to increase lending to all segments
of society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these successes, the CRA examination and enforcement system has been criticized. Financial institutions
have complained that policy guidance from the supervisory agencies on the CRA is unclear and that examination standards
are applied inconsistently. Financial institutions have also complained that the CRA examination process encourages
them to generate excessive paperwork at the expense of providing loans, services, and investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Community, consumer, and other groups have agreed with the industry that there are inconsistencies in CRA evaluations
and current examinations overemphasize process and underemphasize performance. Community and consumer groups
also have criticized the regulatory agencies for failing to aggressively penalize banks and thrifts for poor performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Believing that the CRA examination and enforcement process can be improved, the President requested in July 1993
that the Federal financial supervisory agencies reform the CRA examination and enforcement system. The President
asked the agencies to consult with the banking and thrift industries, Congressional leaders, and leaders of community-based
organizations across the country to develop new CRA regulations and examination procedures that ``replace paperwork
and uncertainty with greater performance, clarity, and objectivity.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the President asked the agencies to refocus the CRA examination system on more objective, performance-based
assessment standards that minimize compliance burden while stimulating improved performance. He also asked the
agencies to develop a well-trained corps of examiners who would specialize in CRA examinations. In undertaking this
effort, the President requested that the agencies promote consistency and even-handedness, improve CRA performance
evaluations, and institute more effective sanctions against institutions with consistently poor performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the President's initiative, the four agencies held a series of seven public hearings across the country
in 1993. At those hearings, the agencies heard from over 250 witnesses. Nearly 50 others submitted written statements.
The preamble to the December proposal reviewed the results of those hearings.

The December Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal (58 FR 67466) would have eliminated the twelve assessment factors in the present CRA regulation
and substituted a performance-based evaluation system. Under the December proposal, a financial institution would
not have been assessed on its efforts to meet community credit needs, nor on its methods for determining the credit
needs of its community. Rather, the agencies would have evaluated institutions based on their actual lending, service,
and investment performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, independent institutions with at least $250 million in assets and affiliates of holding companies with
at least $250 million in bank and thrift assets would have been evaluated based on some combination of lending, service,
and investment tests. Institutions would have had to report to the agencies and make available to the public data on
the geographic distribution of their loan applications, denials, originations and purchases. Small banks and thrifts
could have elected to be evaluated under a streamlined method that would not have required them to report this data.
Every institution would have had the option to have its performance evaluated based on a pre-approved strategic plan
that had been subjected to review and comment by community-based organizations and the rest of the public. However,
the strategic plan option would not have relieved an institution of its data reporting obligations.

There would have been five ratings_``outstanding,'' ``high satisfactory,'' ``low satisfactory,'' ``needs to
improve,'' and ``substantial noncompliance''_under each of the lending, investment, and service tests so as to
measure with more refinement the variations in performance among institutions. The agencies proposed to have only
four overall ratings, however, as required by statute_``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,''
and ``substantial noncompliance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal was originally published with a 60-day comment period. This period was extended for 30 additional
days in view of the magnitude of the proposed changes, the complexity of the issues, the level of interest in the subject,
and delays resulting from the holiday season (59 FR 5138). After considering the thousands of comments received,
the agencies produced the revised regulations proposed today, which respond to suggestions in the comments while
preserving the December proposal's goal of emphasizing performance over process.

The agencies reviewed and considered all of the above-described comments concerning the December proposal. Comments
are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of the revised proposal. As a general matter,
the vast majority of commenters expressed support for the agencies' goal of developing more objective, performance-based
assessment standards that minimize burden while stimulating improved performance. Many commenters believed that,
under the existing CRA regulations, the agencies focus too closely on documentation of CRA performance and too little
on actual performance. These commenters felt the present documentation requirements are overly burdensome. Many
commenters also supported the agencies' goal of ensuring consistency and evenhandedness among the agencies in CRA
evaluations. Commenters supported enhanced CRA examiner training to increase consistency. While most commenters
generally supported the agencies' goals in amending their CRA regulations, many expressed concern over some aspects
of the December proposal.

The Revised Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
In General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The revised proposal retains, to a significant extent, the principles and structure underlying the December proposal
but makes significant changes to the details in order to respond to many of the concerns raised in the comments. Like
the December proposal, the revised proposal would eliminate the existing regulation's twelve assessment factors
and substitute a performance-based evaluation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to take into account community characteristics and needs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised proposal would make explicit the assessment context against which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tests and standards set out in the proposed regulation would be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This assessment context would include consideration of: (1) Demographic data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the community; (2) information about community characteristics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs; (3) information about the institution's capacity and constraints; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) information about the institution's product offerings and business strategy; (5) data on the prior performance
of the institution; and (6) data on the performance of similarly-situated lenders. The agencies, rather than the
institution, would develop the assessment context for each institution. The agencies will neither require nor request
an institution to provide data for this assessment context, although any data offered by an institution would be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the December proposal, the agencies would give particular attention to the institution's record of helping
to meet credit needs in low- and moderate-income geographies. However, the revised proposal would further emphasize
the institution's performance with respect to low- and moderate- income individuals, and other individuals and
areas where appropriate, given community characteristics and needs. The agencies also have modified the definitions
of low- and moderate-income geographies in response to concerns that the definitions in the December proposal were
too low for high cost areas. Under the revised proposal, the qualifying income levels would be adjusted to reflect
prevailing housing construction costs or significant anomalies in family income levels. The agencies would make
available annually a list of qualifying income levels by geographic area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lending, service and investment tests would continue to constitute the primary method by which the agencies would
assess the CRA performance of independent retail institutions with at least $250 million in assets and affiliates
of holding companies with at least $250 million in bank and thrift assets. However, the revised proposal changes how
an institution's ratings on the three tests would be combined to produce the institution's overall composite rating.
The revised proposal would give primacy to lending performance by requiring an institution to receive a ``satisfactory''
or better rating on the lending test in order to receive a ``satisfactory'', or better, overall rating. At the same
time, the rating system would increase the importance of the service and investment tests, because the effect of those
tests on the overall rating would no longer be limited to situations in which an institution had extraordinarily strong
or weak performance on one of the tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also have made modifications to the details of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending, service and investment tests in order to broaden their scope. Rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than rely presumptively on a few quantitative measures that could then be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted or rebutted by other considerations, the tests would be based from the outset on a broader range of quantitative
and qualitative criteria that would include both those criteria that formed the basis for the presumptive ratings
in the December proposal and those additional considerations contained in the adjustment and rebuttal sections
of the December proposal. The revised proposal therefore would not use rebuttable presumptions and adjustments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revisions to the lending, investment and service tests would increase, rather than reduce, the number of judgments
that examiners would be required to make in the examination process. The agencies believe that a CRA evaluation system
eliminating all examiner judgment would not be desirable, even if it were achievable. Preservation of examiner judgment
to take into account the characteristics and needs of an institution's community and the capacity and constraints
of the institution is critical.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
At the same time, the agencies believe that consistency in evaluations, reduction in compliance burden, and focus
on performance are fully consistent with the necessary degree of examiner judgment. The agencies believe that the
revised proposal, which entails a series of examiner decisions in reliance on detailed data concerning an institution's
actual lending, service and investment performance, would provide the proper balance between objective analysis
and subjective judgment. In order to minimize unnecessary subjectivity, the agencies have attempted to provide
more guidance in the revised proposal as to the standards that examiners would apply to make the required judgments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to identifying the data that would form the basis for their performance analysis, the information that
would provide the background assessment context, and the criteria that would guide the assessments, the agencies
have proposed detailed performance rating profiles for each rating level of the lending, service, and investment
tests. An institution's performance need not fit every performance aspect of the typical profile in order to receive
a certain rating. Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak performance on others.
However, the institution would receive a rating which is generally consistent with the institution's overall performance
on the various aspects of the profile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal based its presumptive ratings on comparative terms, for example whether an institution's
qualified investments were significant as compared to its capital, or whether an insignificant percentage of an
institution's branches were located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies in the institution's
service area. While many comments stated that these terms should be further defined, few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, despite a specific request in the December proposal, actually suggested what these definitions should
be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ratings profiles in the current proposal continue to use comparative terms, such as excellent, significant,
and poor, without further specification. Many comments agreed that the mechanical application of numerical ratios
would not foster fair and appropriate CRA assessments. The agencies continue to believe, given the wide diversity
of institutions and communities, that it is inadvisable to provide such specific numerical ranges or ratios. The
agencies expect the current proposal to increase the consistency and clarity of the examination process. By identifying
a set of performance-based assessment criteria, and expanding the objective performance data available to examinations,
institutions and the public will be better able to evaluate the basis on which examiner judgments are made. In addition,
by providing more detailed profiles that involve several criteria, assessment under the current proposal will not
turn on the evaluation of a single factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also modifies the lending and service tests for retail institutions to emphasize the importance
of community development activities in the assessments of performance under those tests. In addition, the revised
proposal replaces the investment test with a community development test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions.
The proposal incorporates into this community development test both community development lending and community
development services in addition to qualified investments. Therefore, under the revised proposal, wholesale or
limited purpose institutions would be subject only to the community development test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would reduce data reporting burdens by streamlining reporting requirements to coincide more
closely with existing requirements and eliminating unnecessary reporting. The one significant new data reporting
requirement would be that small business and small farm loan data reported to the agencies would include information
on the race and gender of small business and farm borrowers to respond to concerns that the December proposal did not
give enough weight to the fair lending aspect of an institution's CRA performance. This concern is also reflected
in the revision of the provisions regarding consideration of illegal discrimination to conform them more closely
to existing regulatory language.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Smaller banks and thrifts would continue to be evaluated under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamlined assessment method that would not require reporting of additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending data. However, the streamlined method would be the presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for evaluating small institutions and would be applied to every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifying institution unless the institution affirmatively requests an alternative assessment method. The agencies
have also altered the description of the streamlined assessment method in order to make clear that this assessment
is not intended to operate as an exemption from the CRA rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The streamlined assessment method would continue to focus on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loan-to-deposit ratio, degree of local lending, record of lending to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers and geographies of different income levels, and record of responding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to complaints. The institution's fair lending record would still be taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account in assigning a final rating. In response to comments, the agencies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated the provision in the December proposal that made a loan-to-deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of 60% or more presumptively satisfactory. The revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider an institution's size, financial condition, and credit needs of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area in evaluating whether its loan-to-deposit ratio is reasonable. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation would further consider, as appropriate, other lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as originations for sale on the secondary market and community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development lending and investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every institution would continue to have the option to be evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to a pre-approved strategic plan. The strategic plan option would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relieve an institution from any reporting obligations that it otherwise would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have. The revised proposal clarifies, however, that small institutions would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject themselves to any data reporting responsibilities by electing the strategic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan option. The agencies also have provided more detail as to how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed strategic plan option would operate in practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal has eliminated provisions that some comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted as ``safe harbors'' from examination or enforcement action. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposal would not make substantive modifications to the December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions governing what types of institutions are subject to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, although the agencies have clarified that bankers banks would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be covered. The revised proposal continues to provide that uninsured branches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of foreign banks would not be covered by the proposed regulations. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agencies are aware that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CRA coverage of certain uninsured branches of foreign banks. Should this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act be signed into law, the agencies would modify the revised proposal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the new legal requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal would have made an institution with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' subject to an enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 12 U.S.C. 1818. A number of commenters questioned the legal authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the agencies under the CRA to use assigned ratings as the basis for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action. Other commenters endorsed taking enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against institutions with poor CRA ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal includes the enforcement provisions from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal while the agencies continue to analyze the issues raised by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments. The agencies invite further comment on these issues before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing a final rule.

The Lending Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The lending test in the December proposal would have evaluated_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of its performance in relation to other lenders subject to CRA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an independent basis_the extent to which a retail institution was making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans in the low- and moderate-income portions of its service area. The test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have evaluated an institution's lending performance relative to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders by comparing the institution's market share of housing, small business, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm, and consumer loans in the low- and moderate-income geographies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its service area with its share of such loans in the other parts of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. The test would have evaluated performance on an independent basis by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examining the ratio of reported loans made (both number and amount) by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution in the low- and moderate-income geographies of its service area to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reported loans made throughout its entire service area and the geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of its reported loans across the low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographies of its service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the election of the institution, the agencies would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered indirect loans under the lending test. Indirect loans were defined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include loans made by third parties, such as lending consortia, subsidiaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, non-chartered affiliates funded by the institution, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders that lent to low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the institution had made lawful investments. The agencies would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributed indirect loans to an institution in proportion to the size of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's investment in or funding of the third party lender or participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the third party's loans, provided the institution reported the indirect loans.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The December proposal would have made a distinction between the ability of an institution to claim credit under the
lending test for indirect loans by its subsidiaries and funded non-chartered affiliates and its ability to claim
credit for indirect loans made by other lenders. An institution would have been able to claim credit for lending by
its subsidiaries or non-chartered affiliates if the institution either invested in the entity or made a loan to it.
For third party lenders, however, the institution would have been required to make an investment in the entity (as
opposed to making a loan to the entity) in order to claim credit under the lending test for the third party loans. The
purpose of this distinction was to recognize the unique relationship between an institution and its subsidiaries
and affiliates, and to give institutions and their parent corporations greater flexibility to structure their lending
as they saw fit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the foregoing factors would have served as the basis for a rating under the lending test, the December proposal
would have allowed the agencies to adjust an institution's assessment upward, and, in exceptional cases, downward.
Upward adjustment might have been warranted if the institution made, for example, a substantial amount of loans requiring
innovative underwriting or loans for which there was special need, such as loans for multifamily housing construction
and rehabilitation, loans for start-up or very small businesses, loans to community development organizations
or facilities, or loans to very low-income individuals and geographies. An institution's assessment also could
have been increased if it operated a ``second look'' program to reevaluate loan applications that, based on an initial
review, the institution had planned to deny. On the other hand, a downward adjustment could have been warranted if,
for example, the quantitative measures inaccurately portrayed the institution's actual lending to low- or moderate-income
geographies or individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters from both the banking industry and the public believed the lending test contained in the December proposal
was too narrow in its focus. In particular, some believed the test gave insufficient emphasis to community development
lending and innovative underwriting. Other commenters noted that the proposed lending test placed undue emphasis
on the location of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics (

 income). Some commenters believed the December proposal would have given institutions a greater incentive to make
loans to high-income borrowers located in low-income geographies than to make loans to low-income borrowers located
in high-income geographies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who believed the December proposal underemphasized the importance of community development
lending, the revised proposal would treat such lending as a principal component of an institution's lending performance,
not merely an adjustment factor. The revised proposal also defines community development loans. Such loans are loans
(including lines of credit, commitments and letters of credit) that address affordable housing or other community
economic development needs not being met by the private market, provided such loans (1) Principally benefit low-
or moderate-income individuals, businesses or small farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million,
or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program; (2) have not
been reported or collected by the bank or one of its affiliates as home mortgage loans, small business loans, small
farm loans, or consumer loans for CRA purposes, unless the loans are for multifamily dwellings (as defined in the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) regulations); and (3) except in the case of a wholesale or limited purpose bank, benefit the bank's service area(s)
or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's service area(s). This definition clarifies that
community development loans deserving of favorable consideration are those that fill a void left by the ordinary
operation of the private market. In addition, it is designed to prevent double-counting of all loans except for multifamily
housing loans, which the agencies believe should be considered both in the distribution analyses of an institution's
home mortgage lending and for evaluation of its community development lending in order to properly evaluate the value
of the loans for CRA purposes. Finally, the definition also provides that an institution will get favorable consideration
for a community development loan if it is in the institution's service area or is in a broader region that includes the
institution's service area. This broader geographic scope would recognize the nature of some lending programs and
consortia that produce these loans. An institution would be evaluated based on the number, amount, complexity, and
innovativeness of its community development loans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies also have revised the lending test in response to comments that the December proposal placed undue emphasis
on the geography of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics. Under the revised proposal,
while the agencies would continue to place a heavy emphasis on the geographic distribution of an institution's lending,
they also would consider favorably loans made to low- and moderate-income individuals regardless of where the borrowers
reside. The agencies would evaluate the number and amount of home mortgage loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and
upper-income individuals; the number and amount of loans to small business and small farms with annual revenues less
than or equal to $1 million; the number and amount of loans to small businesses and small farms by size of loan; and, at
the institution's option, the number and amount of consumer loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income
individuals. The revised proposal provides that distribution of borrower characteristics would be examined with
particular reference to the institution's service area, but need not be limited to the institution's service area.
Institutions would receive favorable consideration for lending to low- and moderate-income individuals and small
businesses and farms outside of their service area, so long as they have not neglected these borrowers inside their
service area. The agencies have also created an assessment criterion regarding an institution's use of innovative
and flexible lending practices to recognize those programs and products that might have been cause for upward adjustments
in the December proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies received numerous comments on the market share component of the lending test. Many banks and thrifts
felt the market share test was misleading in that, among other things, it overlooked loans by institutions that do
not have any reporting obligations under HMDA or CRA. Further, institutions could have had service areas that overlapped
partially, but not completely, in ways that would distort the measurement of their lending performance under the
test. Many also were concerned that if one bank increased its market share, another necessarily would lose market
share; hence, the commenters suggested that the market share test could promote a price war among institutions trying
to make loans in low- and moderate-income areas, potentially leading to unsafe and unsound banking practices. Banks
and thrifts frequently stated that the lending test in the December proposal was a form of credit allocation. On the
other hand, many community groups and government officials liked the market share test because it provided an objective
and quantitative standard for measuring an institution's CRA performance. At the same time, a number of community
groups expressed concern that the formula did not take into account qualitative differences among loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, the lending test has been modified. The lending test would continue to give significant
weight to the geographic distribution of an institution's lending; and, as part of the assessment context, examiners
would consider, among other considerations described earlier in this preamble, the performance of other similarly-situated
lenders where appropriate. In this regard, examiners would use market share and other analyses to assist in evaluating
the geographic distribution of an institution's lending where such analyses would provide accurate insight. However,
the proposed regulation does not require examiners to use any single type of analysis, and would not link a particular
market share ratio, or any ratio, with a particular lending test rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering the geographic distribution of an institution's loans, the agencies, under the revised proposal,
would evaluate the number and amount of an institution's loans in the low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income
geographies of the institution's service area. They also would assess the dispersion of the institution's lending
throughout its service area. In response to concerns expressed by some commenters that an institution might limit
the size of its service area to obtain a better performance rating, the revised proposal would penalize an institution
if too little of its lending were made inside its service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While agreeing with the concept of including affiliate and third-party lending at the institution's option, many
industry commenters criticized the December proposal_which would not have considered lending by chartered or non-funded
affiliates_as unduly restrictive and inconsistent with the corporate funding practices of certain institutions.
Also, some community and consumer groups expressed concern that institutions could use third-party lending to avoid
their direct lending obligations and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like the December proposal, the revised proposal would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, at their option, to include affiliate and third-party lending in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending record but would make certain changes to the December proposal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regard. First, the revised proposal would consider indirect lending by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution's affiliates_regardless of whether the affiliate is chartered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how it is funded. The revised proposal would not impose restrictions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporate structures of institutions and their affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the rules regarding the allocation of loans among affiliates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been simplified. The revised proposal would also include several new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions designed to prevent an institution from selectively including (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding) its affiliate lending. Under the revised proposal, the agencies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate an institution's affiliate lending when assessing the institution's overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending performance, provided the institution (or its affiliate) chooses to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and report the data pertaining to such lending. If an institution chooses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report some of its affiliate loans in a service area for a particular lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, such as home mortgages, or small business loans, it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report all of its affiliate loans of that category for that specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service area. An agency would be able to consider the lending of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's affiliate, notwithstanding whether the institution wants the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider its affiliate lending, if the agency were to determine that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending is integral to the institution's business. An affiliate's lending would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integral to an institution's business if the institution's operations closely involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or support the marketing, management, or other operation of the affiliate's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending. Lending would not be considered integral to an institution's business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely because the institution had a financial interest in the affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the revised proposal would no longer allow an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include third party loans with its direct and affiliate loans for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the geographic distribution of the institution's lending or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of its lending across borrower characteristics. Under the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, third party loans could be attributed to an institution only if they meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of community development loans. This change responds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from community and consumer groups who expressed concern that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions could use third-party lending to avoid their direct lending obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations. The revised proposal also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would operate to relieve third party lenders of the burden of reporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic location of their loans that could have been placed on them by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal.

The Investment Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the December proposal, retail institutions as well as wholesale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited purpose institutions would have been evaluated under the investment test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the amount of assets they had devoted to ``qualified investments'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison to their risk-based capital. The focus of the investment test would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been on the ultimate impact of an institution's investment rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment per se. Therefore, qualified investments would not have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credited under the test unless they had a demonstrable impact, e.g., in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing loans or community development projects that benefit low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals and geographies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualified investments would have included lawful investments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit low- and moderate-income geographies or individuals in an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service area. Examples of such investments would have included those: (1) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of local affordable housing and community, economic, or small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business development; (2) in community development financial institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development corporations, community development projects, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business investment companies (including specialized small business investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies), and minority- and women-owned financial institutions and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development financial intermediaries; (3) in consortia or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities serving low- and moderate-income individuals and areas; and (4) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state and local government agency housing bonds or state and local government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenue bonds specifically aimed at helping low- and moderate-income areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and individuals. Eligible grants and the donation or sale on favorable terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches to minority- or women-owned financial institutions also would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted as qualifying investments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies could have adjusted an institution's rating upward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the investment test to take into account whether the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments were particularly innovative or met a special need or whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's activities in connection with the investments were particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex or intensive. The agencies also would have been able to adjust an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's rating upward if the institution had made a large amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments that would have been qualified investments except that they failed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit the institution's service area. Downward adjustments would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been justified only in exceptional cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters criticized several aspects of the proposal. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notably, many banking industry commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test's focus on the amount of qualified investments relative to an institution's risk-based capital. They felt reliance
on any such investment-to-capital ratio would unfairly penalize well-capitalized institutions. Community groups
commented on various aspects of how the term ``qualified investments'' was defined and the banking industry criticized
the restriction that qualified investments must benefit the institution's service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investment test in the revised proposal has been modified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the principal concerns raised in the comments. The reliance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of qualified investments to risk-based capital has been eliminated. Rather, under the revised proposal, the
agencies would focus on the dollar amount of the institution's qualified investments (independent of the institution's
capital), the innovativeness and complexity of the qualified investments and their connection to credit needs,
and the institution's responsiveness to credit and community economic development needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the revised proposal clarifies the definition of ``qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Qualified investments are lawful investments, deposits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membership shares in a credit union, and grants that primarily benefit low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals or businesses or farms with under $1 million in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual revenues or that qualify as small businesses under SBA regulations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that address affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development
needs that are not being met in the normal course of business by the private market. The agencies intend the limitation
regarding needs not being met by the private market to exclude untargeted municipal bonds and standard mortgage-backed
securities. The revised proposal also would clarify that grants, membership shares in a credit union, and other non-loan
financial support can qualify as qualified investments. Under the definition, a qualified investment would not
otherwise be disqualified because an institution receives favorable treatment (for example as a tax deduction or
credit) for them under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, under the revised proposal, qualified investments
no longer would need to benefit an institution's service area, provided the investments benefit a broader statewide
or regional geographic area that includes the institution's service area. This change would conform with the broader
geographic scope permitted for community development loans discussed previously.

Examples of qualified investments identified by the agencies include, but are not limited to, investments and grants:
in or to financial intermediaries (including, but not limited to CDFIs, CDCs, minority- and women-owned financial
institutions, and low-income or community development credit unions) that primarily lend or facilitate lending
in low- and moderate-income areas or to low- and moderate-income individuals in order to promote affordable housing

and construction, including multifamily rental housing; in support of organizations promoting small businesses,
including Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), and specialized SBICs; in and to not-for-profit organizations
serving low- and moderate-income housing needs and/or other community economic development needs; to support or

moderate-income individuals, such as day care facilities, in projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits;
in state and municipal obligations that specifically support affordable housing or other community economic development
to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals or areas; to not-for-profit organizations serving low- and moderate-income

The revised proposal deletes the definition of small business from

the December proposal that some commenters criticized as too complicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the qualified investment and community development loan definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer to investments and loans that benefit businesses with annual revenues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under $1 million or that would qualify as small businesses under a Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business Administration program. The $1 million figure was chosen because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used in Regulation B to differentiate among borrowers for requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning adverse action notices and application retention. The new proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions also maintain a treatment of small business that conforms to the SBA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, as required by law for federal agencies.

As described more fully later in this preamble, under the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, wholesale or limited purpose banks would be subject to evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the new community development test rather than under the investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test.

The Service Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have evaluated an institution's CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service performance primarily on the basis of the percentage of its branches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of branches that an institution would have been expected to have in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or readily accessible to low-and moderate-income geographies in each service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area would have depended, in part, on the number of such geographies in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service area. Under the December proposal, institutions would not have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to expand the size of their branching network or to operate branches at a loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies would have been able to adjust an institution's service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record upward or downward to reflect more accurately its branch service to lowor moderate-income geographies or
individuals, but downward adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been made only in exceptional cases. In determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness and degree of any adjustment, the agencies would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered: (1) the institution's record of opening and closing branches; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) whether branches_wherever located_were actually serving low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals; (3) any significant differences in the quality, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity or types of services offered to low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies; and (4) similar factors.
The agencies also could have adjusted an institution's rating upward to reflect a strong record of providing or supporting
other services that promote credit availability for low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies. Particular
weight would have been given to credit and home-ownership counseling, small and minority-owned business counseling,
low-cost check-cashing, and low-cost deposit services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service test contained in the revised proposal would change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service test contained in the December proposal in response to comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the agencies. In crafting the December proposal, the agencies were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guided by a belief that ready access to branches is a critical factor in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of credit and deposit services in a community. However, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking industry representatives commented that the service test placed too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much emphasis on ``brick and mortar'' branches (i.e., permanent staffed banking facilities). The commenters noted
that although branches are still valuable, present technology has made the need for branches less imperative to the
provision of banking services. On the other hand, many consumer groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stressed that, despite changes in technology, brick and mortar branches continue to have symbolic and practical
relevance to credit availability. A number of commenters emphasized, however, that evaluations based on the mere
presence of brick and mortar facilities is not sufficient. Rather, the agencies must consider the actual services
that are provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, the agencies have decided to modify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the service test so that ``brick and mortar'' branches no longer would serve as the overwhelming factor in assessing
an institution's service performance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although they still would receive prominent consideration. Under the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, equal weight would be given to the actual services provided to low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and moderate-income geographies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, the agencies would evaluate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's systems for delivering retail banking services (where the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``systems'' includes, among other things, branches, automated teller machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ATMs), loan production offices, banking by telephone or computer, mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches, and bank-at-work or by-mail programs) by: (1) assessing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of the institution's branches and ATMs among low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies;
(2) reviewing the institution's record of opening and closing branches and ATMs; (3) assessing the range of services

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) evaluating the availability of alternative systems for delivering retail banking services.

In addition, the agencies would evaluate the extent to which an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provides community development services and the innovativeness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsiveness of such services, given the needs of the institution's community and the capacity and constraints

The Community Development Test for Wholesale or Limited Purpose Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December proposal, wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions were defined as insured depository institutions that are in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business of extending credit to the public but do not make a significant amount of reportable loans (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
home mortgage, consumer, small farm and small business loans). These would have included institutions that make
primarily large commercial loans, as well as credit card banks, and similar institutions. The December proposal
would have required an evaluation of the CRA performance of these institutions primarily under the proposed investment
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance under that test would have been measured based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of an institution's assets devoted to qualified investments as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to its risk-based capital. Qualified investments would have consisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of lawful investments that benefited low- and moderate-income geographies or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals in an institution's service area, including investments that supported local affordable housing and
community, economic, or small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development. Eligible grants and loans that would have constituted a qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment also would have been included within the investment test. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigning the overall rating for wholesale or limited purpose institutions, the institution's investment test
rating could have been increased one level for outstanding performance and decreased one level for a ``substantial

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance'' rating on the service test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the comments received, the revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace the investment test with the community development test as the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. A number of commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered the investment test too narrowly focused to use as a tool for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the CRA performance of wholesale or limited purpose institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested replacing the test with a test that focused on community development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities more generally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The community development test in the revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus on a wholesale or limited purpose institution's record in helping to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the credit needs of its service area through qualified investments, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development lending, and community development services. In general, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development-related activities would be similar to the community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development aspects of the lending and service tests, and would adopt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of qualified investments used in the investment test in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. The community development test also would consider small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and small farm loans as well as loans to low- and moderate-income individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and geographies as community development loans, whether or not reported or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected under the data collection requirements of the revised proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believed the December proposal's definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wholesale or limited purpose institutions did not clearly distinguish between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these types of institutions and retail institutions. Some commenters also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that these institutions be permitted to conduct a certain amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental retail lending without losing their wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution status. Several comments suggested that an institution should have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity to confirm its status as a wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution with the agencies in advance of being examined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to these comments, the revised proposal would clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which institutions would be considered wholesale or limited purpose institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of CRA. The definition for institutions eligible for wholesale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited purpose designation would be as follows: (1) wholesale institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that are not in the business of extending home mortgage, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, small farm, or consumer loans to retail customers; and (2) limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose institutions are institutions that offer only a narrow product line (such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as credit cards or automobile loans) to a national or regional market. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would not be considered in the business of extending loans to retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers if it does not hold itself out to the retail public as providing such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans and the institution's revenues from extending such loans are insignificant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when compared to its overall lending operations. An institution could conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some incidental retail lending if the retail activity would not cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to exceed these limitations. However, a so-called ``niche institution'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(an institution that is in the business of lending to the public but which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specializes in certain types of retail loans or extending credit to a class of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers with, for example, certain financial or professional characteristics) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not generally qualify as a wholesale or limited purpose institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also would require an institution that elects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated as a wholesale or limited purpose institution to file a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request with the appropriate agency and receive confirmation of its status before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commencement of the examination. The agencies will issue guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding how long in advance of a scheduled examination an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file its request, and under what circumstances an institution will have to reapply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain wholesale or limited purpose status. An institution whose request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale or limited purpose status has been denied by the appropriate agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be evaluated under the tests applicable to retail institutions, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, or an institution with approved strategic plans, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS did not include provisions for wholesale or limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose thrifts in its version of the December proposal. In response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the OTS's revised proposal includes provisions that would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thrifts the opportunity to request designation as a wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.

Small Institution Assessment Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have offered small banks and thrifts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the option of choosing to be evaluated under a streamlined assessment method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations would not have imposed upon small institutions the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements imposed on other institutions. The agencies stressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble to the December proposal that, notwithstanding the different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment methods, examinations of small banks and thrifts would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful examinations and would not have been implemented as de facto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small banks and thrifts were defined in the December proposal as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent institutions with assets of less than $250 million or members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holding companies the total banking and thrift assets of which are less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$250 million. A small institution's CRA rating under the December proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been based primarily on its lending record. An institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been presumed to receive a ``satisfactory'' rating if it had a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan-to-deposit ratio, made the majority of its loans locally, had a good loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mix (i.e., made a variety of loans to the extent permitted by law and regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and lent across economic levels), had no legitimate, bona-fide complaints from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community members, had not committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which it had knowledge that it had not corrected fully or was not in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of correcting fully, and had not engaged in a pattern or practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illegal discrimination that it had not corrected fully. If an institution was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report loans under the HMDA, the institution also would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to have a reasonable geographic distribution of reported loans.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small institution that met each of the standards for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory'' rating and exceeded some or all of those standards could have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received an overall rating of ``outstanding'' depending on the degree to which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded the criteria for a ``satisfactory'' rating and, at its option, its record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making qualified investments and its record of providing services. If a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to meet or exceed all of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating, the relevant agency would have conducted a more extensive examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution, including, at the option of the institution, an examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its investment and service performance. Also, if a small institution operated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than one service area, the relevant agency would have evaluated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's performance in all of those service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many community and consumer group commenters asked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to eliminate the small institution assessment method because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that it would operate as an exemption for qualifying institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, many banks and thrifts, as well as the weight of Congressional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, supported the streamlined approach. The agencies have retained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamlined assessment method as modified in the revised proposal. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies also have retained the December proposal's exemption of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from the new data collection and reporting requirements for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, small farm and community development loans, although the agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have clarified that small institutions would not be subjected to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements because they request to be evaluated under the strategic plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies reiterate, however, that they do not intend by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to exempt small institutions from the CRA or subject them to a less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demanding standard of performance. The revised proposal has been redrafted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so that the format of the small institution approach is more straightforward. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal first states the criteria that the agencies would use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the performance of a small institution, and then describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance levels that correspond to satisfactory performance. As under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests for large retail institutions, the agencies have eliminated the structure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebuttable presumptions and have proposed a rating profile. A small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's performance need not fit every aspect of the rating profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing ``satisfactory'' performance for it to receive that rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance on others provided the institution's overall performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the rating profile. Small institutions that do not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for a ``satisfactory'' record would be given the appropriate rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the necessity of a ``closer review.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that under the December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal an institution would be required to affirmatively elect to be examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the streamlined assessment method and suggested that the streamlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method be the default examination procedure unless a qualifying institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elects another assessment method. The agencies agree and have drafted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposal accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing holding companies and small institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are affiliates of holding companies with total banking and thrift assets over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$250 million urged that the $250 million asset limit take into consideration only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assets of the subject bank or thrift and not the aggregate amount of bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thrift assets held by the holding company or, alternatively, that the asset 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit be raised. Many community and governmental groups, on the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the asset limit should be lowered. After considering all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the agencies have decided to retain the definition of small institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in the December proposal. No compelling evidence was presented to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support a change of the asset limit. Further, the revised proposal reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notion that the CRA performance of a small independent institution or small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affiliate institution of a small holding company should be measured against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different standards than a small institution affiliate of a larger holding company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consideration of assessment context added in the revised proposal will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the agencies to make this differentiation. The larger holding company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be expected to provide support and assistance to a degree not available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a small independent institution or to an affiliate institution of a small holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters from small institutions criticized the presumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the December proposal that a 60% loan-to-deposit ratio was reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters pointed out that economic conditions, institutional capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other constraints may result in loan-to-deposit ratios significantly below this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure. Although the agencies did not intend the December proposal to suggest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a loan-to-deposit ratio below 60% would have been presumed less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable, the agencies have eliminated the use of any fixed percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the revised proposal would require that an institution's loan to deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio, adjusted for seasonal variation and, as appropriate, other lending related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, must be reasonable given the institution's size, financial condition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the credit needs of its service area. The adjustment for lending related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as secondary market sales and community development lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and investment, is new in the revised proposal. This provision responds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns that institutions that package and sell their loans would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantaged, compared to portfolio lenders, by a strict loan-to-deposit ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. The proposed adjustment also addresses concerns raised by commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the small institution assessment method in the December proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have ignored the community development lending performance of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many industry commenters also criticized the requirement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal that, to be presumed to be performing satisfactorily, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would have needed a good loan mix, which would have included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering, to the extent permitted by law, a variety of loans to customers across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic levels. These commenters were concerned that an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been required to offer all permissible loan products to all customers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies agree that the focus on the types of products offered was inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the tenor of the proposed regulation as a whole and have altered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion in the revised proposal to eliminate any requirement concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of products that an institution offers. The revised proposal would retain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aspect of the criterion focussing on lending to customers across economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related change, the revised proposal would broaden the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion in the December proposal concerning the distribution of loans by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions required to report loan data under HMDA. The revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would explicitly provide that the agencies would consider the geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of loans of all small institutions, not just these subject to HMDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe this consideration was implicit in the December proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which required lending across economic levels. In any event, the agencies do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not intend this change to result in any increased documentation burden on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. The geographic analysis would be performed by the agencies' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examiners and would not be required of the institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also received comments questioning the meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criterion in the December proposal focussing on the complaint record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small institutions. Because of concerns by commenters that a ``legitimate, bona- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fide complaint'' was not adequately defined, the agencies have now proposed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion that would focus on the institution's record of taking appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, as warranted, in response to written complaints about its CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed concern that the December proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was unclear regarding the circumstances under which a small institution could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have earned an ``outstanding'' or less than ``satisfactory'' rating. The changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised proposal clarify and conform the treatment of small banks to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement proposed for large retail institutions_that lending performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be ``satisfactory'' for an institution to receive an overall satisfactory rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, the agencies would consider a small institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment and service performance in order to determine whether it is eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an ``outstanding'' rating. Strong investment or service performance could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help boost a small institution's rating to the ``outstanding'' level. Poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment or service performance would not lower a small institution's rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below ``satisfactory'' but could prevent the institution from receiving an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'' rating. The agencies would not consider investment and service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance to offset less than ``satisfactory'' performance by a small institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basic assessment criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also reflects minor changes to clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of small institutions. The agencies have eliminated the criterion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the December proposal relating to discrimination because the issue is addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the section on the assignment of overall ratings. In addition, consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the changes in the proposal for large institutions, the discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination procedures for small institutions with multiple service areas has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been eliminated.

Strategic Plan Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have provided that, as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to being rated under the lending, service, and investment tests, or the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution assessment standards, an institution could submit to its supervisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency for approval a strategic plan detailing how the institution proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet its CRA obligation. The December proposal would have required that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan be submitted three months in advance of its effective date, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution solicit public comment on the plan at the time the plan is submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency. No plan would have been approved unless it provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals for proposed performance and those goals constituted at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory performance under the standards of the regulation. No plan could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have had a term beyond two years, and the institution could have petitioned the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to amend the plan on the grounds that a material change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances made the plan no longer appropriate. The agency would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed the CRA performance of the institution under the plan. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to meet or exceed the preponderance of its goals, its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance would have been evaluated against the lending, service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment tests or the small institution assessment method, as applicable. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution operating under an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved strategic plan would not be relieved of its obligation to report data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concerns regarding the strategic plan option most consistently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised by the comments were the December proposal's lack of details 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning important aspects of how the plan option would operate and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of public input into the process. The revised proposal would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially more detail about the operation of the plan option than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal, and would modify the December proposal in other respects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well. In the revised proposal, the agencies have attempted to provide a real 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to the standard lending, investment, and service tests through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategic plan option, while assuring that those operating under a plan are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a CRA assessment that is no less stringent and performance-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the proposed standard tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would substantially revise the provisions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the December proposal regarding public participation in the plan process. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be required to informally seek suggestions from the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while developing the plan. Once the institution had developed the plan, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be required to formally solicit public comment on the plan for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 30 days. The agencies have decided not to extend the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period to avoid unduly lengthening the plan process. After the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period, the institution would submit the plan to its regulator, along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any comments received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received, the plan in the form released for public comment. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised proposal, a submitted plan would be approved if the agency fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
act on the plan within 60 days after submission, unless the agency extended the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review period for good cause. Until a plan was approved, an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to the standard performance tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes would increase the opportunity for productive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community input in the plan process. By requiring an institution to seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal suggestions in formulating a plan, and then to solicit formal comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before submitting a plan to the agency, this process will encourage consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between an institution and its community, including local government, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community leaders, and the public. There would not be a further comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period after the institution submits its proposed plan to the agency because such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a comment period could undermine the direct communication and consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between an institution and its community that is most beneficial to the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would provide that, in evaluating a plan, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response by the institution to public comment on the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments appeared to misunderstand why the strategic plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would provide for input from the public. The plan option would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions an opportunity to tailor their CRA objectives to the needs of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community and their capacity and expertise. Few comments suggested that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be able to determine the needs of its community without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consulting in some fashion with those in the community. Several industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments were concerned that under the strategic plan option, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations would play an inappropriate role in an institution's operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the purpose of the consultation would be for the institution to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the needs of its community and how they might be met so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it can make better judgments when formulating its plan objectives. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision regarding how the institution is to meet those needs would remain with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. In reviewing the public participation, the agencies would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider whether community organizations unanimously supported the plan, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the institution made an appropriate investigation to determine the needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its community, and whether, considering the information about community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit needs that the institution received in the comments, the plan goals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. The agencies would evaluate strategic plans and their proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals in the assessment context against which the tests and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed regulation would be applied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised proposal also would provide significantly more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance regarding the standards for approval of a plan. Commenters on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal were divided over the standards for approval. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters thought the regulation should state that the standards for approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a plan are the same as the standards on the lending, service, and investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, or that the plan should require no less lending than the lending test. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast, some industry commenters thought that the plan would not provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real alternative unless it permitted an institution to depart from the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests in responding to local needs. Under the revised proposal, a plan would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to specify measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's service area, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals. These goals would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to reflect the institution's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would require that the plan specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals in lending, investment, and the provision of services, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the circumstances. The proposal would specify the broad criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lending, investment, and services that should be the framework for the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals. At the same time, however, the proposal would make clear that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has great flexibility to fashion its program within those parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution would not be required to set levels of performance in all three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories. In order to maintain the focus on lending for retail institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating under a plan, a retail institution's goals would have to emphasize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending and lending-related activities, unless a different emphasis were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate given the credit needs of the service area, public comment, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's capacity and constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies intend through these provisions to provide guidance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry and the community regarding the standards for plan approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while preserving substantial flexibility for institutions to tailor their CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The purpose of the plan is not to provide institutions operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a plan with a different or lesser obligation to help meet the needs of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community; it is to provide more certainty and flexibility for those institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that wish to meet their obligation in a fashion that they believe may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately assessed by the standard performance tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would require that each plan specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals, the satisfaction of which, the institution believes, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant a ``satisfactory'' rating. An institution also would have the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying a separate set of goals that, if met, would warrant an ``outstanding'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating. An institution would not be considered for a rating of outstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless its plan contained outstanding goals that had been approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also would clarify how performance would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed under the plan. The agencies believe that the standard of performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the December proposal should be strengthened, and the revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require an institution to substantially achieve its plan goals to receive that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating. This would apply to the satisfactory rating and, if the plan contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such approved goals, to the outstanding rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that the possibility of being considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the standard tests, as contemplated by the December proposal, made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan a less attractive alternative to the standard tests. The revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would, unless the institution chose otherwise, rate an institution's performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under an approved plan solely in relation to its plan goals. An institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the option, however, to elect in its plan to be subject to the standard tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should its performance under the plan goals be less than satisfactory. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies intend that an institution operating under an approved plan would, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the period of the plan, never be subject to assessment under the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, unless the institution so chose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to industry comments that said the two year plan term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the December proposal was too short to warrant the expense of preparing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan and to permit institutions to initiate activities with a longer view, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies have lengthened the possible plan term to 5 years, but would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan to have annual interim measurable goals. The agencies agree that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial to provide institutions the opportunity for long-range planning, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim goals should enable effective examinations during the plan period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would permit an institution to develop a single plan for one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more or all of its service areas and allow affiliated institutions to prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
joint plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of industry commenters indicated that the possibility of public disclosure of confidential information
presented a major disincentive to their use of the strategic plan alternative. The revised proposal would allow institutions
to submit additional information to the relevant agency on a confidential basis. However, the publicly available
information would have to be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the agency to judge fairly the merits of
the plan's goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also would provide more detail regarding plan amendment. An institution would be able to petition
for an amendment on the grounds that a material change in circumstances had made the plan no longer appropriate. In
order to preserve the integrity of the public participation in the plan process, any proposed amendment would have
to go through the public consultation and comment process described earlier in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite industry comments to the contrary, the revised proposal continues to provide that approval of a plan would
not affect an institution's data collection responsibilities. The data are useful to the agencies in assessing overall
lending in communities, and would also be of value to the public. Since the institution's plan would be in its public
file, the public would have the appropriate context in which to evaluate the lending data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also clarifies that evidence of discrimination would affect an institution's rating based
on plan performance in the same manner as such evidence would affect an institution's rating calculated pursuant
to the standard tests.

Assigned Ratings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December proposal, institutions would have been assigned one of four overall, or composite, ratings, as
required by the statute: ``outstanding'', ``satisfactory'', ``needs to improve'', and ``substantial noncompliance''.
In the December proposal, ratings on the lending, investment, and service test were combined into a composite rating.
For a retail institution, the institution's rating under the lending test would have served as the base rating. This
base rating would then have been increased by two levels in the case of outstanding investment performance or by one
level in the case of high satisfactory investment performance. For a wholesale or limited-purpose institution,
the institution's rating under the investment test would have served as the basis for the overall rating. For any institution,
the rating would have been increased by one level in the case of an ``outstanding'' rating for service and decreased
by one level in the case of a ``substantial non-compliance'' rating for service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the lending, service and investment tests had five rating levels rather than four, the rating would then have
been converted to the statutorily-required four level rating system, with ``high satisfactory'' and ``low satisfactory''
both scored as ``satisfactory''. An institution that would otherwise have received a ``needs to improve'' rating
would have been rated in ``substantial noncompliance'' if the institution received no better than a ``needs to improve''
rating on each of its two previous examinations. Finally, the rating would have been adjusted to take into account
any illegal lending discrimination by the institution to arrive at a final composite rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters, particularly community and consumer groups, were concerned that the rating system proposed in
December permitted a retail institution with poor lending performance to achieve a satisfactory or outstanding
overall rating through outstanding performance on the investment and service tests. These commenters asked that
no retail institution be permitted to achieve a satisfactory overall rating unless it received a satisfactory rating
on the lending test. The revised proposal would ensure that lending performance receives sufficient weight by weighing
a retail institution's rating on the lending test so as to count for at least 50 percent of its overall rating. Furthermore,
a retail institution would be required to achieve a rating of satisfactory on the lending test in order to receive an
overall rating of satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters were concerned that investment and service performance only affected an institution's overall
rating at the margins_if investment or service performance was extraordinarily strong or weak. The revised proposal
would allow investment and service performance to boost an institution's rating provided the institution had achieved
a rating of satisfactory on the lending test. Poor performance on either the investment or service test could negatively
affect an institution's overall performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These principles would be implemented through the process described in paragraph (b) of Appendix A for assigning
a rating for retail institutions assessed under the lending, service and investment tests. Points would be assigned
to an institution's performance on each of the underlying tests. The total number of points would determine the composite
rating, unless the total exceeds twice the number of points attributable to the institution's performance under
the lending test. In that case, the composite rating would be determined using twice the number of points attributable
to the institution's lending performance to ensure that lending performance accounts for at least 50 percent of the
overall rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small institutions, wholesale or limited purpose institutions, or institutions with an approved strategic plan
would be rated as described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of Appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the December proposal, the revised proposal would require the agencies to adjust ratings for all institutions,
regardless of the method of CRA evaluation, to take evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices
into consideration. In addition, the revised proposal, as in December's proposal, provides that an institution
that otherwise would receive a needs to improve rating would be rated in substantial noncompliance if it received
no better than a needs to improve rating on each of its two previous examinations.

Lending Discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December proposal, an institution would presumptively have received a final CRA rating of less than satisfactory
if the institution (1) committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination of which it had knowledge that it had not
corrected fully or was not in the process of correcting fully or (2) engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination
that it had not corrected fully. The presumption could have been rebutted in the case of technical or de minimis violations,
for example, if an institution violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by offering a preferential credit program
for individuals over age 55 (rather than limiting the program to individuals over age 62 as the law requires). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many community and consumer groups criticized this proposal as a retreat from current practice. They pointed out
that the existing regulation provides that the agencies will consider any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices. Although the agencies did not intend in the December proposal to reduce the weight given evidence
of illegal discrimination in the CRA evaluation process, they believe that the commenters' concerns should be addressed.
The revised proposal conforms with the language of the existing regulation. Also, the discrimination provisions
in the revised proposal would avoid the use of a rebuttable presumption consistent with the elimination of presumptions
throughout the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices would adversely affect
the agencies' evaluation of an institution's CRA rating. In determining the effect on an institution's rating, the
agencies would consider the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the institution has
in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the institution
has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and
other relevant information, such as the institution's past fair lending performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was also some confusion regarding whether the December proposal intended that illegal discrimination would
have the same effect for all institutions regardless of the assessment method that they chose. The revised proposal
makes clear that evidence of discrimination would be considered in assigning a rating to all banks and thrifts, regardless
of whether they were evaluated under the lending, service, and investment tests, the community development test
for wholesale or limited purpose banks, the small institution assessment method, or the strategic plan option.

Multiple Service Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution's CRA rating should reflect its performance in all
the local communities in which it does business. However, the proposed regulatory language provided that the agencies
would conduct full lending, service, and investment tests (or the other appropriate assessments) in a sample of the
service areas in which the institution operated. The agencies would then assign separate composite ratings for each
area. The institution's overall rating would reflect the performance of the institution in all service areas studied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters urged the agencies to conduct assessments in every one of an institution's service areas, because
every institution has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of all of its service areas. These commenters and
others also expressed concern that the regulation did not provide clear rules as to how performance in each of the service
areas assessed would be combined to arrive at an overall rating for the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution is obligated to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including all of the institution's
service areas. However, ensuring that institutions fulfill this responsibility does not necessarily require that
an institution's performance in each of its service areas must be examined. Questions of how many service areas should
be examined during an examination and how performance in different service areas should be weighed are more appropriately
handled through examination procedures than through regulatory language. The agencies have therefore omitted
from the revised proposal all discussion of examination treatment of multiple service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies note that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would establish requirements for the examination of
multi-state and other institutions. This proposal and examination procedures will be modified as necessary to comply
with that Act if it becomes law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Effect of Ratings on Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CRA requires the agencies to consider an institution's CRA performance record when considering an application
by the institution to establish a deposit facility (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, branch). The December proposal specified how CRA ratings would be considered in applications. For example, an application
from an institution with a ``substantial noncompliance'' CRA rating would have generally been denied, whereas an
application from an institution with an ``outstanding'' rating would have been given extra weight. A ``satisfactory''
rating generally would have been consistent with approval of an application and a ``needs to improve'' rating, absent
other evidence, generally would have resulted in a denial or conditional approval of an application. The agencies
emphasized, however, that the CRA examination rating is not conclusive and recognized that other information related
to CRA performance and the convenience and needs of communities, including information collected through public
comment and reports, is also relevant and would be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not intended as such, a number of the commenters believed these provisions would have provided institutions
with a ``safe harbor'' from challenges to their performance record in the applications process if they achieved an
``outstanding'' CRA examination rating. Those commenters were concerned that they could be prevented from effectively
commenting on the CRA performance aspects relevant to applications and urged that those provisions be dropped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion of the effect of particular ratings on applications in the December proposal was not intended to alter
the agencies' policy of considering examination ratings and public comment during the applications process and
has been deleted. As stated in the December proposal, the agencies have consistently recognized that materials relating
to CRA performance received during the applications process from public comments and other sources, can and do provide
relevant and valuable information. The revised proposal explicitly states that interested parties would have the
opportunity to comment on applications and that the agencies would take their views into account in considering the
CRA performance of an institution in the applications process. The agencies continue to believe, as provided in the
Interagency Policy Statement Regarding the Community Reinvestment Act, that information from an examination is
a particularly important consideration in the applications process because it represents the on-site evaluation
of an institution's CRA performance by its primary federal regulator. The revised proposal also would specify that
an institution's record of CRA performance would be considered in an institution's expansion proposals (as defined
in the CRA) and may be the basis for approving, denying, or conditioning approval of an application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Service Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have replaced the concept of ``delineated community'' in the existing regulation with
the concept of service area. The December proposal would have defined service area as the area around each institution's
office or group of offices where the preponderance of direct reportable loans made through those offices are located.
A service area would have been presumed acceptable if it was broad enough to include low- and moderate-income geographies
and did not arbitrarily exclude such geographies. An institution had the opportunity to show there were no low- and
moderate-income geographies within a reasonable distance given its size and financial condition, and the supervisory
agency could reject an otherwise acceptable service area if the service area did not account for the true effective
lending territory of the institution or if it reflected past redlining or illegal discrimination. The proposal would
have required an institution to delineate multiple service areas if the geographies it served extended substantially
across state boundaries or the boundaries of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). An institution serving military
customers would have been permitted to delineate a ``military community'' consisting of those customers. Each institution
would also have been required to compile and maintain a list of all the geographies within its service area or areas
and a map of each service area. The December proposal would not have required wholesale or limited purpose institutions
to delineate a service area, but would have treated all low- and moderate-income geographies in the country as the
service area for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of numerous comments received on this issue, the revised proposal makes several changes to the definition.
Several commenters suggested that the proposed regulation adopt concepts from the existing regulation, including
the equidistance provision that requires an institution to include those areas around its offices where it makes
a substantial portion of its loans and all other areas equidistant from its offices as those areas. The revised proposal
would adopt the equidistance principle from the current regulation in slightly modified form. The equidistance
requirement is an effective tool to assure that the delineation of a service area is consistent with the purposes of
the statute and that institutions do not draw their service areas too narrowly. This modification clarifies the service
area requirement and builds on concepts with which the industry and community already have experience. This change
does not significantly modify the substance of the December proposal, since the December proposal preamble stated
that a service area conforming to the equidistance concept would generally have been acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also incorporates the concept of ``local area'' from the current regulation. This responds
to comments expressing concern that loans made a substantial distance from a branch might inappropriately expand
the scope of a service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would delete the requirement that a service area be broad enough to include low- and moderate-income
areas. The necessity for this requirement was unclear, given the provision preventing institutions from arbitrarily
excluding low- and moderate-income geographies. The proposal would clarify that the requirement that low- or moderate-income
geographies not be arbitrarily excluded would take into account the institution's size, financial condition, and
the extent of its branching network. An institution's performance evaluation would include an account of how many
low- and moderate-income geographies are included in the institution's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would clarify that an institution's service area is derived from its direct lending in relation
to its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs, rather than its other non-deposit-taking offices. This appropriately
links an institution's CRA obligations to where it takes deposits, while enabling the agencies to review whether
the institution is serving the needs of its entire community in the manner in which it extends credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters were particularly concerned that the December proposal meant that lending conducted by non-branch
offices, such as loan production offices, would expand an institution's service area. The revised proposal would
not require an institution to include geographies where an institution has made loans through a loan production office,
unless those geographies are in the local area around a deposit-taking branch or ATM. However, an institution would
be free to include such geographies if it wishes, and the regulation would provide some incentive to do so. Under the
revised proposal, if an agency determined that lending by an institution's affiliate(s) was integral to the business
of the institution, then it would include the lending by that affiliate in its assessment of the institution's lending
performance, even if the institution had not requested the agency to do so. In addition, by limiting the size of its
service area, an institution would increase the likelihood that it would perform poorly on the criterion of the lending
test that considers the proportion of the institution's total lending in its service area(s).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rather than requiring the service area to include those geographies accounting for a ``preponderance'' of the institution's
loans, as in the December proposal, or the areas accounting for a ``substantial portion'' of the institution's loans,
as in the existing regulation, the revised proposal would require the service area to include those geographies in
which the institution has made ``a significant number and amount of loans.'' The agencies intend the meaning of ``significant''
to be broad, and to include all geographies around its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs where an institution
has made more than a handful of loans. Because of this change in the proposal, the criterion in the small institution
assessment method that requires a majority of an institution's loans to be in its service area(s) for a satisfactory
rating would not be redundant as it might have been in the December proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, as in the December proposal, the agencies would consider whether the delineation reflects
illegal discrimination, and thus would, as some commenters suggested, consider the racial composition of geographies
in reviewing an institution's delineation. The agencies have eliminated the term ``redlining'' because the agencies
believe that term is included in the term ``illegal discrimination.'' In this regard, illegal discrimination includes
the practice of refusing to lend to an area or neighborhood on the basis of race or other prohibited bases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters thought that the agencies should require institutions to justify the methodology for delineations,
and that the regulation expressly provide for community input into the delineation. Under the revised proposal,
examiners would review whether the service area meets the requirements of the regulation, but the agencies would
not prescribe or review the method by which an institution defines its service area. Rather than having the agencies
determine whether a delineation is ``reasonable,'' it is simpler and more effective in meeting the purposes of the
statute to focus on the lending patterns of the institution, whether low- and moderate income areas are excluded,
and whether the service area reflects illegal discrimination. Furthermore, the revised proposal would not expressly
provide for community input into the delineation. As part of the assessment context, agency staff would review comments
from the community with regard to the performance of an institution, including its delineation of its service area(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would retain the requirement from the December proposal that institutions delineate multiple
service areas, with clarifying modifications. The revised proposal would not require institutions to delineate
an MSA or other political boundary. The requirements that would govern under the revised proposal should prevent
institutions from inappropriately limiting their service area(s) in order to exclude certain geographies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested requiring the service area to include full census tracts and block numbering areas to facilitate
data collection and reporting. The agencies agree, and the revised proposal would contain such a requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While comments generally supported the separate treatment of wholesale or limited purpose institutions, many commenters
questioned whether wholesale or limited purpose institutions should have nationwide service areas and suggested
that more consideration should be given to qualified investments in the institution's local area. Some commenters
claimed that permitting wholesale banks to define a ``national community'' violated the ``local community'' orientation
of the statute. The revised proposal would eliminate a mandatory nationwide service area for wholesale or limited
purpose institutions. Such institutions have chosen to locate in particular communities, and it is appropriate
that their CRA performance reflect their location. The revised proposal would therefore require that a wholesale
or limited purpose institution designate as its service area the area or areas around its offices, or a broader statewide
or regional area that includes such areas. The institution would have a broad scope in preparing this designation,
so long as the area meets the purposes of the CRA and does not arbitrarily exclude low and moderate income geographies.
Performance under the community development test would focus on qualified investments, community development
loans outstanding and community development services that benefit the areas within the institution's service area.
Qualifying activities that benefit areas outside the institution's service area would be considered up to an amount
equal to the amount of qualifying activities within the institution's service area. However, if the institution
could demonstrate only a limited need or opportunity to provide qualifying activities within its service area, the
appropriate agency could modify or eliminate this limitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Data Collection and Reporting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have required institutions that were not eligible for the small institution streamlined
assessment method to collect and report to the agencies data showing the geographic distribution of written applications,
application denials, originations and purchases for home mortgage, small business and small farm, and consumer
loans. Home mortgage loans would have included all mortgage loans reportable under HMDA and its implementing regulations.
The proposal would have required institutions to report separately information covering loans for home purchase,
home improvement, multifamily dwellings, and refinancings. Small business loans would have included all loans
to private, for-profit organizations that in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan had gross receipts of
less than $10 million (for a firm providing services), or up to 500 employees (for a manufacturing firm). As proposed,
institutions would have had to separate such loans into in four categories based on the sales volume of the business.
Small farm loans would have been defined to include all loans to private organizations engaged in farming operations
with gross receipts of less than $500,000 in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan. Consumer loans would
have been defined to include all closed-end loans, secured and unsecured, extended to a natural person primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes, except for credit card loans and motorized vehicle loans and those loans
included in the definition of home mortgage loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal would also have required institutions to report data in summary form by geography for each of
the three major loan categories_mortgages, small businesses and small farms, and consumer_by January 31 of each
calendar year. The data would have covered the related lending activity that took place in the preceding calendar
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised general concerns regarding the data collection requirements in the December proposal. As
discussed later in this preamble, the agencies have streamlined requirements to reduce burden. In addition, the
agencies plan to make software available to institutions to facilitate compliance with the proposed requirements.
The agencies have proposed the data collection and reporting requirements in this revised proposal as a means for
permitting the agencies to fulfill their responsibilities under the CRA of assessing each institution's record
of helping to meet the credit needs of the community. This proposal has also been made to permit the agencies to discuss
the facts supporting the agencies' conclusions regarding the institution's record of lending.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments on the proposed data collection raised five principal concerns, all of which have been addressed in the
revised proposal. First, many commenters indicated that the proposed rules would be overly burdensome and, in the
case of home mortgage loans, would have required duplicative tracking of data. Under the revised proposal, the agencies
would base their analysis of mortgage lending on the data already reported pursuant to HMDA. To acquire more geographic
detail on home mortgage lending, the agencies propose to amend the HMDA regulation to require that institutions other
than small banks and thrifts report the geography of applications, approvals, and denials for loans secured by properties
outside the institution's MSA, data that is already reported on a voluntary basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, some commenters questioned whether the need for consumer loan data justified the burden of mandatory reporting.
However, many of the same commenters suggested that if consumer loan data were to be required, the data should include
all consumer loans, including credit card loans and motor vehicle loans, which were not included in the collection
and reporting requirements of the December proposal. Some institutions indicated that consumer lending was an important
aspect of their CRA performance that should be considered by the agencies. The revised proposal would offer institutions
the option of collecting data on the amount outstanding, the location of the borrower, and the income of the borrower
for each open-end and closed-end consumer loan outstanding as of the end of the calendar year. Such data is typically
required by all institutions as an integral part of their loan underwriting procedures. If an institution selected
this option, the foregoing data would be reviewed during the institution's CRA examination but would not be reported
to the agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, many lenders criticized the December proposal's inclusion of information on small business applications
and application denials. Those commenters indicated that reporting should be limited to loan outstandings or loan
originations. The revised proposal would simplify the definition of small business and small farm loans, by adopting
the definition of those terms now used by institutions for purposes of completing, in the case of banks, their Reports
of Condition and Income (Call Reports), and in the case of thrifts, the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Under the revised
proposal, institutions would collect and report data on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans included in the aggregate
small business and small farm loan figures on the institution's Call Report or TFR, which includes business loans
with original amounts under $1 million and farm loans with original amounts under $500,000. These data would include
the outstanding balance as of December 31 of each year, the location of the business or farm or the location where the
loan proceeds would be applied (as indicated by the borrower), an indication of whether the borrower has annual revenues
of less than or equal to $1 million, and an indication of whether the borrower (if not publicly traded) is more than 50
percent owned by one or more minority individuals or by one or more women. The loan register information would be required
to be submitted at the same time and in accordance with the provisions for submitting HMDA data as provided in 12 CFR
Part 203 (Regulation C). In addition, the revised proposal would change the date on which Call Report or TFR data on
small business and small farms loans would be required to be submitted from June 30 to December 31 of each year to coincide
with the calendar year reporting requirements of HMDA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, many commenters criticized the failure of the December proposal to require the collection of data on the race
and gender of borrowers except to the extent such data was required by current law. These commenters were particularly
interested in the reporting of race and gender data for small business loans in order to support the fair lending component
of the CRA assessment. In response to these comments, the revised proposal would require institutions to collect
certain race and gender data in connection with their small business and small farm lending. Each institution would
be required to request, either in connection with a written application or, if the institution did not use written
applications, at an appropriate point in the lending process, that an applicant or borrower indicate the percentage
of the business or farm owned by men and by women as well as the percentages owned by members of different racial and ethnic
categories. If the institution neither takes a written application nor originates the loan, the institution would
not be required to request the information. To protect the privacy of individual borrowers, this detailed information
would not be included on loan registers, which, as noted earlier in this preamble, would only indicate whether an individual
loan was to a business or farm that was more than 50 percent women-owned or more than 50 percent minority-owned. The
institution would also retain but not report or disclose the information on applicants who did not receive a loan.
To further safeguard privacy, the loan registers would not be disclosed to the public but the institutions would include
aggregate information about the loans in their public CRA files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, some commenters were concerned that because community development loans were not required to be reported,
examiners would not give them sufficient weight in evaluating an institution's lending performance. The revised
proposal would require institutions to report on their Call Reports and TFRs the aggregate number and dollar amount
of community development loans outstanding as of December 31 of each year.

Public File and Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have required institutions to make available for public inspection: (1) a file containing
all the signed, written comments that it had received from the public for the past two years; (2) its performance data
for that period; (3) maps of its service areas (with lists of the census tracts or block numbering areas that make up
each service area); and (4) a copy of the public section of its most recent CRA Performance Evaluation. If an institution
elected to be assessed under the strategic plan option, it would have been required to include a copy of its plan in the
public file. The December proposal would have required the institution to maintain the public file at its main office
and to make available copies of the file at cost to members of the public. Materials relating to a given service area
would have been maintained at each branch in that service area, and every institution would have been required to post
in the public lobby of each branch a notice of its CRA obligation and the public's opportunity to comment on and review
data concerning that performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters generally favored the public disclosure of an institution's CRA-related activities, and the revised
proposal retains all the relevant public disclosure provisions of the December proposal. The revised proposal modifies
the required contents of the public file to reflect proposed changes in the various assessment tests and the proposed
data collection requirements for small business and small farm loans. For example, consistent with the proposed
service test, the revised proposal would require an institution to maintain a list of its branches and ATMs along with
their locations and the services generally available at such facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To protect the privacy of borrowers and the competitive information of institutions, the revised proposal would
not require an institution to include the small business or small farm loan registers containing information on individual
applicants in its public file. Instead, the revised proposal would require the public disclosure of aggregated information
on small business and small farm loans for the past two calendar years by every institution (other than a small institution).
Loan registers would be available to agency examiners to confirm the accuracy of the aggregated data but the agencies
do not intend to make unaggregated information publicly available.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the revised proposal, the following aggregated loan data for small business and small farm loans would be placed
in the public file: (1) the number and amount of loans in low-,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; (2) a list of the geographies in which an institution made at least
one loan; (3) the number and amount of loans inside and outside the institution's service area; (4) the number and amount
of loans to minority- and women-owned businesses; and (5) the number and amount of loans to businesses and farms with
annual revenues equal to or less than $1 million. Institutions would also be required to disclose the number and amount
of community development loans outstanding. Institutions may elect to disclose publicly the number and amount of
consumer loans to individuals and geographies by various income levels, and the number and amount of these loans made
within and outside its service area(s). However, to protect the privacy interests of borrowers, an institution may
not place in its public file any loan information described above for a particular year if special circumstances,
such as a small number of loans or a limited number of geographies in the designated categories, could reasonably be
expected to disclose the borrower's identity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small institution would be required to include its loan-to-deposit ratio computed at the end of the most recent calendar
year. The institution could include other data on its loan-to-deposit ratio if it believed the data would give a more
accurate picture of its lending and lending-related activities. If a small institution elects to be rated under the
lending, investment, and service tests applicable to larger institutions, it would be required to include in its
public file all of the lending information described earlier in this preamble. An institution electing to be assessed
under an approved plan would continue to provide a copy of its plan in the public file but would not have to disclose information
submitted to the agencies on a confidential basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the agencies have modified the provisions regarding the location of the public file. The
complete public file would be required to be maintained at the institution's main office. In addition, at least one
branch in each service area would be required to have copies of the bank's HMDA Disclosure Statements and all materials
in the public file relating to the service area in which the branch is located. If a member of the public requested to
review a bank's public file at a branch that did not have a copy, the bank would have to make a complete copy of the file
for that service area available for review at the branch within 5 business days at no cost.

Public Notice

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have required that institutions provide the Community Reinvestment Act Notice ``in
the public lobby of its head office and each branch,'' and it would have set forth the Notice. The revised proposal makes
minor changes to the Notice requirements. The term ``head office'' is changed to ``main office'' for clarity. Within
the Notice, the statement of what is included in the CRA performance file would be expanded to describe more accurately
the contents of the file. In addition, the revised proposal would require that the file include a map identifying the
institution's service area, a list of its branches and ATMs in its service area, and a list of services the institution
provides at each of the foregoing locations.

The December proposal would have required that each agency publish a list of the banks scheduled for CRA exams in each
calendar quarter at least 30 days before the beginning of the quarter, and permitted members of the public to submit
comments about a bank's CRA performance. The revised proposal would leave intact the provision concerning timing
of publication, but delete as redundant the provision concerning public comment.

Transition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have established a transition period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from July 1, 1994, to April 1, 1996. Institutions subject to data collection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements would have been required to begin collecting home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortgage, small business, and consumer loan data on July 1, 1994. The data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been reported to the agencies no later than January 31, 1995, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually thereafter. Evaluations under the proposed standards would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begun April 1, 1995. However, any institution could have elected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated under the existing twelve assessment factors rather than the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards until July 1, 1995, and any institution showing cause could have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested evaluation under the existing standards up to April 1, 1996. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies would have accepted strategic plans for approval at any time after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal, in addition, would have insulated some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from supervisory sanctions until they had been subject to at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two examinations under the proposed standards. Specifically, the agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have disapproved corporate applications or taken any enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action against an institution whose initial CRA rating under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards dropped by more than one level, if the agencies determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop in ratings occurred despite a good faith effort to achieve at least a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory level of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the commenters criticized the transition period in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal for being too short. Those commenters were particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical of the proposal to begin collection of data on July 1, 1994. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggested that the proposed data collection be delayed as much as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 months after the publication of a final rule. Some also criticized the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to begin conducting examinations in 1995 using a partial year's data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the second half of 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters criticized the proposal to insulate certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from supervisory actions until they had gained more experience with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standards. Those commenters were generally concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would have protected institutions whose performance ratings would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have suffered as a result of more objective, performance-based assessments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the revised proposal, the agencies sought to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these concerns in two principal ways. First, despite substantial simplification in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data collection compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide institutions additional time before the data collection would begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, collection of new data elements would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required until July 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates the grace period and instead would provide institutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional time before assessments under the proposed standards would become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would also provide institutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment options prior to full implementation of the rule. Even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments under the proposed standards would not be mandatory until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1996, small institutions would have the opportunity to be examined, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their option, under the small bank assessment method anytime after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1995. Anytime on or after July 1, 1995, an institution could also elect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit for approval a strategic plan to achieve satisfactory or better CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. Examinations under approved strategic plans could begin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed transition schedule, the current regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be repealed in its entirety on July 1, 1996.

Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies recognize that the revised proposal, like the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal, represents a significant change in existing practices and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that cautious administration is therefore required. Consultation by financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with the agencies on compliance with the new standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures will be encouraged, as will liberal use of agency appeals processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supervisory agencies will engage in an internal review of the effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the new regulations. The agencies contemplate reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to improve their effectiveness within the next several years. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies intend for the proposed regulations to require demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance but to impose as little unnecessary compliance burden as possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the agencies will review the regulations to determine whether they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advancing these goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to

improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and use of enforcement tools. The agencies will work together to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations as short in duration as possible, to minimize unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance burden, and to ensure consistency and reliability in the rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

compliance requirements in the proposal, the agencies invite comment on

(1) any administrative burdens that these requirements in the revised proposal

would place on depository institutions, including small depository institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits of these

activities, as measured by home mortgage originations and purchases, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business and small farm loans outstanding, and community development loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding. At the bank's option, the lending test will also evaluate the bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer loans outstanding and any other loan distribution data the bank may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose to provide, such as data on extensions of lines of credit, commitments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and letters of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When evaluating a bank's overall lending performance, the OCC shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weigh its assessments of the bank's home mortgage lending, small business and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm lending, and (at the bank's option) consumer lending to reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative importance of each category of lending to the bank's overall business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OCC shall weigh the bank's community development lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the characteristics and needs of the bank's service area(s), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity and constraints of the bank, and the opportunities available to the bank for this lending.

(1) The OCC shall assess the degree to which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale or limited purpose bank (as defined in &sect;25.12 of this part) is helping to meet the credit needs of its
service area(s) under the community development test only if the bank's written request to be designated as a wholesale
or limited purpose bank has been approved by the OCC before the commencement of its CRA examination, and the designation
has not been revoked either at the request of the bank or at the OCC's own initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The community development test evaluates the record of a wholesale or

limited purpose bank in helping to meet the credit needs of its service area(s) through qualified investments, community
development lending, or community development services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of the community development test only, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development loans include small business and small farm loans and loans to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low- and moderate-income individuals and geographies, whether or not reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The use of innovative or complex qualified investments, community

for these investments, lending, and services, in its service area(s), the OCC may exempt the bank from all or part of
this limitation.

A bank may request to be rated under a strategic plan rather than under the lending, service, and investment tests (&sect;&sect;25.22
through 25.24 of this part), the community development test (&sect;25.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment
standards (&sect;25.26 of this part), by submitting to the OCC a strategic plan as provided for in this section. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank's request to be rated under a strategic plan is not approved until the OCC approves the plan. The OCC's approval
of a strategic plan does not affect the bank's obligation, if any, to report data as required by &sect;25.42 of this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before submitting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan to the OCC for approval, the bank shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Once the bank has developed a plan, formally solicit public comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in a newspaper of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulation in each of its service areas; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for review at all offices of the bank in any service area covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The bank shall submit its plan to the OCC at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. The bank shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also submit with its plan any public comments received, and, if the plan was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised in light of the comments received, the initial plan as released for public

Measurable goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) A bank shall specify in its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area(s) covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, through lending, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product offerings, and business strategy.

Confidential information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The bank may submit additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the OCC on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently specific to enable the public and the OCC to judge fairly the merits

Satisfactory and outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A bank shall specify in its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the bank shall submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals.

Timing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC shall act upon a plan within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. If the OCC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In evaluating the plan's goals, the OCC shall

consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan.

measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending practices to address credit needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test shall

receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the investment test shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the investment test and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' unless it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 25, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the CRA, the OCC received several inquiries from institutions that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although they are chartered as national banks, do not perform commercial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or as trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public for their own account. The OCC concludes that the CRA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this end, the OCC must assess banks' records of performance and take those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the communities in which they are chartered. However, the OCC believes it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the term national bank as used in this part does not include banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or acting as a clearing agent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ratings in general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) In assigning a rating, the OCC shall evaluate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank's performance under the applicable assessment criteria in this part, subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to &sect;25.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the basis of evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior ``needs to improve'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance in others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bank's overall performance, however, should generally be consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate profile stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Banks that are not wholesale or limited purpose banks or small banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC shall assign each bank's lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance one of the five ratings described below.

different size given the product lines offered by the bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) An excellent record of serving the credit needs of the most economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantaged areas of its service area(s), low-income individuals, or businesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including farms) with gross annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with safe and sound operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Extensive use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit needs of low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
High satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC shall rate a bank's lending performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

consistent with safe and sound operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Low satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC shall rate a bank's lending performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``low satisfactory'' if, in general, it demonstrates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Adequate responsiveness to credit needs in its service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) An adequate percentage of its loans are made in its service area(s);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities are in its service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending related-activities for individuals of different
income levels (including low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals) and businesses and farms of different sizes that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable given the demographics of the bank's service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written complaints, if any, about the bank's performance in meeting the credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of its service area(s); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A reasonable geographic distribution of loans given its service area(s).

Eligibility for an outstanding rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank that meets each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small bank's performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'', the OCC shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making qualified investments (as defined in &sect;25.23 of this part) and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in providing branches, ATMs or other services and delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s).

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Satisfactory goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit needs of each of a bank's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' the OCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC shall assess the performance of a bank operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OCC shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the OCC shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals, or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rated under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in &sect;&sect;25.22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 25.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;25.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;25.26 of this part), as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Farm Loans. This register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the CRA data collection process. The register and these instructions are to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual data are to be submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who Must File a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insured banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank and thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated under 12 CFR &sect;&sect;25.22 through 25.24 must also report this information. Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide information on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date,
enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated data submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate registers for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan number is unique. Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000.

A. Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminating on these bases.

Instructions for Completion of the Open- and Closed-End Consumer Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Loans and Closed-End Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The registers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who May Maintain a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower location and gross annual income for loans for which applications were submitted after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, you may enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans To Be Recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation, you must provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer loan figure on your December 31 Report of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Keep in mind that data recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain the data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make sure the loan numbers are unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Instructions for Completion of Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. LOAN NUMBER_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNT_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrower Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For each loan, identify the location of the borrower. Consumer loans are located in the census 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tract or block numbering area where the borrower resides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. MSA_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number. Enter only the MSA number, not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing of MSAs is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. STATE &amp; COUNTY_Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical code for the state and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. Do not use the letter abbreviations used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
3. CENSUS TRACT/BLOCK NUMBERING AREA_Enter the census tract number or block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Tract/Street Index for the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult the Census Bureau's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
census tract outline maps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. GROSS ANNUAL INCOME_Enter the gross annual income upon which your institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relied in making the credit decision. Round all dollar amounts to the nearest thousand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A bank may request to be rated under a strategic plan rather than under the lending, service, and investment tests (&sect;&sect;228.22
through 228.24 of this part), the community development test (&sect;228.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment
standards (&sect;228.26 of this part), by submitting to the Board a strategic plan as provided for in this section.
A bank's request to be rated under a strategic plan is not approved until the Board approves the plan. The Board's approval
of a strategic plan does not affect the bank's obligation, if any, to report data as required by &sect;228.42 of this
part.

Strategic plans in general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A plan may have a term of no more than five years, and any multi-year plan shall include annual interim measurable
goals according to which the Board shall evaluate the bank's performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank with more than one service area may prepare a single plan for all of its service areas or a plan for one or more
but not all of its service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Affiliated institutions may prepare joint plans if the plans provide measurable goals for each institution.

Before submitting a plan to the Board for approval, the bank shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) while developing the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Once the bank has developed a plan, formally solicit public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each of its service areas; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan available for review at all offices of the bank
in any service area covered by the plan.

Measurable goals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each of its service area(s)
covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income
individuals, through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment
and the bank's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Confidential information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bank may submit additional information to the Board on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan shall
be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the Board to judge fairly the merits of the plan.

A bank shall specify in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to be considered for an ``outstanding''
performance rating, the bank shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals.

The Board shall act upon a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. If the Board fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless the Board extends
the review period for good cause.

The Board shall evaluate a plan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of different
sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative
or flexible lending practices to address credit needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the bank's qualified investments, as defined in &sect;228.23 of this part; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The extent and availability of the bank's services, including, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, the accessibility of retail delivery systems and the extent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovativeness of community development services, as defined in &sect;228.24 of this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the term of a plan, the bank may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition the Board to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material change in circumstances has made the plan no longer appropriate. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment proposed shall be developed in accordance with the public

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ratings in general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, the Board shall assign to a bank a rating of ``outstanding,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the bank's performance under
the lending, investment and service tests, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development test, the small bank assessment standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lending, investment, and service tests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board shall assign a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the investment test shall receive an assigned rating of
``outstanding''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test and the investment test and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test shall receive an assigned
rating of ``outstanding''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect the Board's evaluation of a
bank's performance. In determining the effect on the bank's assigned rating, the Board shall consider the nature
and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent discriminatory or other
illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary
corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the bank's past fair
lending performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A bank that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would otherwise receive an assigned rating of ``needs to improve'' shall receive an assigned rating of ``substantial
noncompliance'' if the bank received no better than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two previous examinations.

subsidiary bank of an applicant bank holding company, and of each proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiary bank, in considering any application: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) By a state member bank for the establishment of a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branch or other facility that would be authorized to take deposits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or assumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities if the acquiring, assuming, or resulting bank is to be a state member bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To become a bank holding company; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Shall include those geographies in the local areas around a bank's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Shall not extend substantially across MSA boundaries or state

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 228, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement the CRA, the Board received several inquiries from institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, although they are chartered as banks, do not perform commercial or retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, or as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for their own account. The Board concludes that the CRA is not intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the Board to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. To this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end, the Board must assess banks' records of performance and take those records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities in which they are chartered. However, the Board believes it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit-granting record of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State member bank 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as used in this part does not include banks that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acting as a clearing agent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ratings in general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In assigning a rating, the Board shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate a bank's performance under the applicable assessment criteria in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, subject to &sect;228.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior ``needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve'' ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in others. The bank's overall performance, however, should generally be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the appropriate profile stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

``outstanding'', the Board shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making qualified investments (as defined in &sect;228.23 of this part) and its

Rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board shall assess the performance of a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating, the Board shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the Board shall rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in &sect;&sect;228.22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 228.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in

Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who Must File a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans outstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be evaluated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 228.22 through 228.24 must also report this information. Only provide information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location or borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans To Be Reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for automated data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are outstanding as of December 31 and
not originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any other particular order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Instructions for Completion of Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
LOAN NUMBER_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contain data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNT_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number. Enter only the MSA number, not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing of MSAs is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter ``N/A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Supplemental instructions for collection of data in connection with small

business and small farm loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you neither take a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the information. See the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample form for recommended format and language. This information is to be maintained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported to the agency, but is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from discriminating on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these bases.

Instructions for completion of the open- and closed-end consumer loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Loans and Closed-End Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The registers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who May Maintain a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower location and gross annual income for loans for which applications were submitted after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, you may enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation, you must provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer loan figure on your December 31 Report of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Keep in mind that data recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain the data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make sure the loan numbers are unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the following principles:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating;

``satisfactory'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

service test or the investment test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect the FDIC's evaluation of a bank's
performance. In determining the effect on the bank's assigned rating, the FDIC shall consider the nature and extent
of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices, any corrective action that the bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary
corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the bank's past fair
lending performance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 345, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the CRA, the FDIC received several inquiries from institutions that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although they were chartered as banks, did not perform commercial or retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking services. These institutions served solely as correspondent banks, or as trust companies, or as clearing
agents, and they did not extend credit to the public for their own account. The FDIC concludes that the CRA is not intended
to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the FDIC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs
of their local communities. To this end the FDIC must assess banks' records of performance and take those records into
account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The FDIC believes that these provisions were intended
to cover all banks that are in the business of extending credit to the public including both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
wholesale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
retail
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the communities in which they are chartered.
However, the FDIC believes it would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of institutions
that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as an incident to
their specialized operations. Accordingly the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as used in the FDIC's regulation, part 345 (12 CFR part 345), does not include banks that engage solely in correspondent
banking business, trust company business, or acting as a clearing agent.

 (1) In assigning a rating, the FDIC shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate a bank's performance under the applicable assessment criteria in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, subject to &sect;345.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``needs to improve'' ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in others. The bank's overall performance, however, should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally be consistent with the appropriate profile stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

is reasonable given the demographics of the bank's service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response to written complaints, if any, about the bank's
performance in meeting the credit needs of its service area(s); and

Eligibility for an outstanding rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank that meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some or
all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of ``outstanding''. In assessing whether
a small bank's performance is ``outstanding'', the FDIC shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds each of
the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in making qualified investments (as
defined in &sect;345.23 of this part) and its performance in providing branches, RSFs or other services and delivery
systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree
to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Strategic plan assessment and rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Satisfactory goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the credit needs of each of
a bank's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,''
the FDIC shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC shall assess the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its
plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC shall rate the bank's performance
under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding
rating, the FDIC shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs
to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals,
or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and
service tests (as described in &sect;&sect;345.22 through 345.24 of this part), the community development test
(as described in &sect;345.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in &sect;345.26
of this part), as appropriate.

Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who Must File a Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured banks and thrifts
that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and thrift assets must report this information
for small business and small farm loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets
that wish to be evaluated under 12 CFR &sect;&sect;345.22 through 345.24 must also report this information. Only
provide information on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were
submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, enter ``N/A'' for
all information relating to location or borrower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Reported
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan as defined on schedule
RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data on individual small business loans with original
loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that
had an outstanding balance as of December 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column
headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications
for automated data submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data consistent with the Supplemental
Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data
reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not
be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order.

1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminating on these bases.

beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on borrower location and gross annual income for loans
for which applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before
that date, you may enter ``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income.

II. Types of Loans to be Recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA evaluation, you must
provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate consumer loan figure on your December 31
Report of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. Keep in mind that data
recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain
the data on separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). Make sure
the loan numbers are unique.

Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters).
Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers
contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different branches
or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use of the borrower's
tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy reasons.

a plan to the OTS for approval, the savings association shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while developing the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Once the savings association has developed a plan, formally solicit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newspaper of general circulation in each of its service areas; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for review at all offices of the savings association in any service area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the plan.

the OTS at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The savings association shall also submit with its plan any public comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Measurable goals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A savings association shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its service area(s) covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) A savings association shall address all three performance categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, unless the savings association has been designated as a wholesale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited purpose savings association, shall emphasize lending and lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment and the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The savings association may submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information to the OTS on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan shall be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the OTS to judge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairly the merits of the plan.

A savings association shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals.

The OTS shall act upon a plan within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. If the OTS fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be

The OTS shall evaluate a plan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or flexible lending practices to address credit needs;

 Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the OTS shall assign to a savings association a rating of ``outstanding,''
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the savings association's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part and the following principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A savings association's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending test shall receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending test and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTS's evaluation of a savings association's performance. In determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect on the savings association's assigned rating, the OTS shall consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action
that the savings association has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting
from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the savings association's past fair lending performance.

An applicant for a Federal thrift charter shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a description of how it will meet its CRA objectives when the

chooses provided that the service area(s): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Do(es) not reflect illegal discrimination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do(es) not arbitrarily exclude low- and moderate-income geographies,

(1) Shall include those geographies in the local areas around a savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's branches and deposit-taking ATMs in which the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association has originated or had outstanding, during the previous calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, a significant number and amount of home mortgage, small business and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm, and (if the savings association chooses to have them considered in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ratings in general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In assigning a rating, the OTS shall evaluate a savings association's performance under the applicable assessment
criteria in this part, subject to &sect;563e.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the basis of evidence
of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior ``needs to improve'' ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A savings association's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating profile in order to receive
that rating, and exceptionally strong performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance
in others. The savings association's overall performance, however, should generally be consistent with the appropriate
profile stated below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Eligibility for an outstanding rating. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A small savings association that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating of ``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small savings association's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance is ``outstanding'', the OTS shall consider the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association exceeds each of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating and its performance in making qualified investments (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;563e.23 of this part) and its performance in providing branches, ATMs or

 A small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree to which its performance

 The

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTS shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS shall assess the performance of a savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association operating under an approved plan to determine if the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association has met its plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the savings association substantially achieves its plan goals for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory rating, the OTS shall rate the savings association's performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the savings association exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTS shall rate the savings association's performance under the plan as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the savings association fails to substantially meet its plan goals for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its plan goals, or if the savings association so elected at the time it first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests (as described in &sect;&sect;563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part), the community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association assessment standards (as described in &sect;563e.26 of this part), as

Instruction for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who Must File a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured banks and thrifts
that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and thrift assets must report this information
for small business and small farm loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets
that wish to be evaluated under 12 CFR 563e.22 through 563e.24 must also report this information. Only provide information
on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were submitted after July
1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, enter ``N/A'' for all information relating
to location or borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan as defined on schedule
SB of the December 31 Thrift Financial Report. Include data on individual small business loans with original loan
amounts of $1 million or less and individual small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had
an outstanding balance as of December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column
headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications
for automated data submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data consistent with the Supplemental
Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data
reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not
be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For each loan, identify the location of the business or farm. Location is determined by the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or other property to which the loan proceeds will be applied (as indicated by borrower) are located; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Small farm loans are located in the census tract or block numbering area where the farm or other property to which

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. MSA_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number,
not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting.
A listing of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers
to metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. State and County_Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit numerical code for the state
and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are available from your regional supervisory agency.
Do not use the letter abbreviations used by the United States Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Census Tract/Block Numbering Area_Enter the census tract number or block numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register.

Instructions for Completion of the Open- and Closed-End Consumer Loan Registers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End Consumer Loans and Closed-End
Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with the collection of this information as part of the CRA
data collection process. The registers and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data
should be maintained. The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an alternative
format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who May Maintain A Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information for loans outstanding
beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on borrower location and gross annual income for loans
for which applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before
that date, you may enter ``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans To Be Recorded
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA evaluation, you must
provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate consumer loan figure on your December 31
Thrift Financial Report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. Keep in mind that data
recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain
the data on separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). Make sure
the loan numbers are unique.

Loan Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

Borrower Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For each loan, identify the location of the borrower. Consumer loans are located in the census tract or block numbering
area where the borrower resides.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
MSA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number, not
the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing
of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers to metropolitan
statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. State &amp; County_Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit numerical code for the state
and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are available from your regional supervisory agency.
Do not use the letter abbreviations used by the United States Postal Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Census Tract/Block Numbering Area_Enter the census tract number or block numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's
Census Tract/Street Index for the most recent census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is publishing for public comment proposed changes to Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) and to the
instructions that financial institutions must use to comply with the annual reporting requirements under the regulation.
The amendments reflect revisions proposed by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision to their regulations implementing the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their
home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding
company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information
on loans and loan applications relating to property located outside the MSAs in which the institution has a home or
branch office. Currently, geographic identification is required only within MSAs where these lenders have an office.
Data would be collected and reported in accordance with the instructions in Regulation C. The agencies believe that
these data would provide more geographic detail on home mortgage lending that would facilitate complete CRA assessments
for institutions that do not qualify as small banks or thrifts.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Board's Regulation C (12 CFR Part 203) implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). HMDA requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan areas to collect data about their housing-related
lending activity. Annually, lenders must report that data to their federal supervisory agencies and disclose the
data to the public. The reports and disclosures cover loan originations, applications that do not result in originations
(for example, applications that are denied or withdrawn), and loan purchases. Information reported includes the
location of the property to which the loan or application relates; the race or national origin, gender, and gross annual
income of the borrower or applicant; and the type of purchaser for loans sold in the secondary market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The federal financial regulatory agencies have proposed amendments to the CRA. The CRA proposal would require banks
or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets
of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million
or more_to collect and report geographic information on loans and applications relating to property located in metropolitan
areas whether or not the institution has a home or branch office there. They will also report geographic information
for property located outside any MSA. (This proposal does not affect the current exemption in &sect;203.3 of Regulation
C for banks and savings associations; for example, institutions whose assets are $10 million or less remain exempt.)
Currently, lenders have the option of collecting this information but are not required to do so. The agencies believe
that these data would provide more geographic detail on home mortgage lending that would facilitate complete CRA
assessments for institutions that do not qualify as small banks or thrifts. The revised final rules would apply to
loan and application data beginning July 1, 1995.

Paragraph (e)_Data Reporting Under CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would add a new paragraph to implement proposed revisions to the agencies' CRA regulations. Under the
joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to
HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking
and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information for all loans and applications,
not just for property in MSAs where the institution has a home or branch office. The requirement also would apply to
property located outside any MSA. The agencies believe that incorporating these reporting requirements in Regulation
C would facilitate compliance for lenders.

With respect to the reporting, disclosure, and other administrative compliance requirements in the proposal, the
Board invites comment on (1) Any administrative burdens that these requirements in the proposal would place on depository
institutions, including small depository institutions and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits
of these requirements in the proposal for depository institutions, their customers, and their communities.

 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The
FFEL regulations govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal
SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as
the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The Federal Stafford Loan, the Federal SLS, the Federal PLUS and the Federal
Consolidation Loan programs are hereinafter referred to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs.
These amendments are needed to conform the FFEL Program regulations to reflect policy decisions made by the Secretary
during development of regulations for the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, hereinafter referred to as the ``Direct
Loan Program.''

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to amend 34 CFR Part 682 of the Department's regulations to reflect certain policy decisions
made during development of regulations for the Direct Loan Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by section 492(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA) the Secretary convened a negotiated
rulemaking committee to develop proposed rules for the second and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. During
the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department, at the request of the negotiators, agreed to make changes in the
FFEL Program to conform to policies and procedures adopted in the Direct Loan Program, wherever possible, to provide
a consistent approach in both programs. In addition, some of these changes are necessary to ensure that the terms,
conditions and benefits of FFEL Program loans and Direct Loans are the same, in accordance with Section 455(a)(1)
of the HEA. These proposed regulations reflect those changes that would affect the FFEL Program. In addition, the
Secretary invites comments on other provisions of the FFEL Program regulations that should be revised to conform
with the Direct Loan Program provisions. The proposed Direct Loan Program regulations were published as a separate
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 18, 1994, 59 FR 42646. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also proposes to delete certain regulatory provisions in 34 CFR Part 682 which duplicate or conflict with
other regulations. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to delete regulations governing the determination of
a student's withdrawal date and institutional refund policies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations will improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs and, by so doing, improve their
capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school
and to pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The student aid programs also enable both current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic
and technologically advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means
for an increasing number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate
effectively, and solve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the following sections of the regulations to reflect changes needed to conform the
FFEL Program to the proposed regulations for the Direct Loan Program. Those changes not related to the Direct Loan
Program are otherwise noted.

_Language that was inadvertently deleted from the FFEL Program final regulations published on June 28, 1994 (59 FR

definition in the Direct Loan Program NPRM and the definition previously included in the December 18, 1992 FFEL regulations,
with a minor revision to reflect the 1993 statutory change that includes the amount of the origination fee and the insurance
premium in calculating the student's cost of attendance.

from borrowers regarding the loan application process and provide information about the terms and conditions for
consolidating FFEL Program loans and the types of loans that may be consolidated. The Secretary believes that borrower
access to this information is critical in light of the expanded repayment options available to consolidation loan
borrowers. This proposed change is also consistent with the obligation assumed by the Direct Loan servicer in the
Direct Loan Program that, although not specified in Direct Loan Program regulations, is assumed by the servicer as
part of its contract with the Department.

at least a half-time basis, or after the end of the period of enrollment, as applicable. However, a lender may make a
late disbursement within 30 days after the standard 60-day period provided for in &sect;682.207 only in documented
exceptional circumstances, such as a student's serious, unexpected illness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

for the benefit of the student, must retain loan proceeds held at the student's request to assist the student in budgeting,
in a designated trust account. Instead, the regulations propose to allow the school to maintain these funds in a separately-designated
subsidiary account under its general bank account. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision for the Direct
Loan Program.

Section 682.605_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to clarify that a school must determine the date of
a student's withdrawal by following the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(i). The Secretary proposes to delete the provisions
regarding leaves of absence. The Secretary's regulations now provide in &sect;668.22 that a student on a leave of
absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of the refund calculation. Therefore, the Secretary believes
that, for consistency, such a student should be considered withdrawn for all purposes.

Section 682.607 Payment of a Refund to a Lender 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.607(c)_The Secretary proposes to revise the timely payment requirement to require a school to pay a refund
to the lender within 30 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn under 34 CFR 668.22(i).
This change is proposed in order to conform to existing General Provisions Regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercises of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

2. Clarity of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the
regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the
regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would
the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded
by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;682.200 Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful
in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to
understand? (5) What else 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand
should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence
Avenue, S.W. (Room 5100, FB&hyph;10), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the statute requires that the Secretary regulate certain actions that must be taken by various program participants,
these requirements would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens
or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal additional requirements to protect
the Federal fiscal interest, as well as the interests of the borrowers under the programs.

Sections 682.205, 682.602, 682.604, and 682.605 contain information collection requirements. As required by the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department will submit a copy of these proposed regulations to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))

The new Transportation Annual Survey (TAS) replaces and expands upon the existing Motor Freight Transportation
and Warehousing Survey (WATS) that covers the trucking and public warehousing industries. The new TAS also includes
transportation by waterway and segments of the busing industry, specifically intercity and rural bus transportation,
bus charter service, and terminal and service facilities. In addition, Census is introducing new data items to the
trucking forms, which will enable them to publish total miles traveled, percentage of miles traveled with loaded
or empty vehicles, weight of shipments, and revenue from transborder shipments. For the first time, this survey will
provide data for over 60 percent of the transportation sector. In future years Census plans to expand this survey to
cover all remaining transportation industries in Division E of the SIC.

In accordance with sections 353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the regulations, an interested party may request in writing
that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must specify
for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a review,
and the requesting party must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or resellers.
If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer if that
producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin, and
each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which reseller(s)
and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to requests by petitioner, respondents, and a domestic interested party, the Department of Commerce
(the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on granular polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) resin from Italy. The review period is August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter
of this merchandise to the United States, Ausimont S.p.A. As a result of this review, the Department preliminary has
determined that dumping margins exist for this firm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily have determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary
results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV.

The Department based United States price (USP) on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c)
of the Act, because all sales to unrelated parties were made after importation of the subject merchandise into the
United States. We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States.
We adjusted these prices for billing adjustments and rebates. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign
inland freight and ocean freight, marine insurance, brokerage and handling charges, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight
from port to warehouse, and U.S. inland freight to customers, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act.
We made further deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses, warranties, technical services, and indirect
selling expenses pursuant to section 772(e)(2) of the Act. For sales of granular PTFE resin finished in the United
States from PTFE wet raw polymer imported from Italy, we also deducted, pursuant to section 772(e)(3) of the Act, the
value added in the United States, which consisted of the costs of further processing in the United States and that portion
of the profit on sales of further processed merchandise attributable to the additional processing.

When comparisons were made to home market sales to which a value-added tax (VAT) was added or in which a VAT was included,
we made an addition to USP for the VAT not collected or rebated on export in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of
the Act and our practice as set forth in

Based on a comparison of the volume of home market and third-country sales, we determined that the home market was viable.
Therefore, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Act, we based foreign market value (FMV) on the packed,
delivered prices to unrelated customers in Italy or, where appropriate, on constructed value (CV).

We calculated FMV on a monthly, weighted-average basis. Where possible, we compared sales of identical merchandise
in the two markets. For each instance in which identical merchandise was not sold in Italy during the relevant contemporaneous
period, we used as FMV contemporaneous home market sales of the product that was the most similar to the merchandise
involved in the U.S. sale, in accordance with section 771(16) of the Act. Because filled and unfilled resins generally
are not similar in terms of their physical characteristics, we compared, whenever possible, home market sales of
filled resins to U.S. sales of filled resins, and home market sales of unfilled resins to U.S. sales of unfilled resins.
We matched filled resins in the U.S. and home markets according to the amounts and types of fillers in the products sold
and the percentages of those fillers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made adjustments to home market prices for rebates. To adjust for differences in circumstances of sale between
the home market and the United States in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a), we deducted post-sale inland freight, inland
insurance, and credit expenses from FMV. Where applicable, we made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics
of the merchandise. We also deducted from FMV indirect selling expenses, in an amount not exceeding the amount of indirect
selling expenses incurred in the United States, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to adjust for differences in packing between the two markets, we deducted home market packing from FMV and
added U.S. packing to FMV. We also adjusted the amount of the Italian VAT included in FMV in accordance with our decision
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Silicomanganese.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No other adjustments were claimed or allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act, we used CV as the basis for FMV when there were no usable sales of such
or similar merchandise in the home market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We included the cost of materials, fabrication, general
expenses, profit, and packing. To calculate CV we used: (1) actual general expenses, or the statutory minimum of 10
percent of materials and fabrication, whichever was greater; (2) actual profit or the statutory minimum of 8 percent
of materials, fabrication, and general expenses, whichever was greater; and (3) packing costs for merchandise exported
to the United States. Where appropriate, we made adjustments to CV, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56, for differences
in circumstances of sale. We deducted home market direct selling expenses, and home market indirect selling expenses
not exceeding the amount of U.S. indirect selling expenses in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed
company will be the rate established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed
or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published
for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value
(LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent
period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) if neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered
in this or any previous review conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others'' rate, as

 822 F. Supp. 782 (CIT 1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement this decision, it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. In proceedings
governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the original LTFV investigation,
the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final
results of administrative review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all
current and future administrative reviews. Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the
``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 46.46 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the
LTFV investigation (50 FR 26019; June 24, 1985). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

FINAL DETERMINATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
We determine that certain paper clips (paper clips) from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely
to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation'' section
of this notice.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the preliminary determination on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 25885, May 18, 1994), the following events have occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 24, 1994, the three participating respondent manufacturers submitted revised information on factors of production.
We also issued an additional supplemental questionnaire to respondents (named below), to which respondents responded
on June 2, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From June 10 through June 24, 1994, we verified that responses of the exporters, Shanghai Lansheng Corporation (Lansheng),
Zhejiang Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (ZMEC), and Zhejiang Light Industrial Products
Import and Export Corporation (ZLIP); and the manufacturers, Wuyi Cultural and Educational Commodities General
Factory (Wuyi), Shanghai Stationery Pins Factory Fengbin (Fengbin), and Jiaxing Stationery Pins Factory (Jiaxing).
Petitioners, ACCO International Inc. and Noesting Inc., and respondents filed case briefs on August 8, 1994, and
rebuttal briefs on August 15, 1994. A public hearing was held on August 17, 1994.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are certain paper clips, wholly of wire of base metal, whether or not galvanized,
whether or not plated with nickel or other base metal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, copper), with a wire diameter between 0.025 inches and 0.075 inches (0.64 to 1.91 millimeters), regardless of physical
configuration, except as specifically excluded. The products subject to this investigation may have a rectangular
or ring-like shape and include, but are not limited to, clips commercially referred to as ``No. 1 clips,'' ``No. 3 clips,''
``Jumbo'' or ``Giant'' clips, ``Gem clips,'' ``Frictioned clips,'' ``Perfect Gems,'' ``Marcel Gems,'' ``Universal
clips,'' ``Nifty clips,'' ``Peerless clips,'' ``Ring clips,'' and ``Glide-on clips''.

Specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation are plastic and vinyl covered paper clips, butterfly
clips, binder clips, or other paper fasteners that are not made wholly of wire of base metal and are covered under a separate
subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The products subject to this investigation are classifiable under subheading 8305.90.3010 of the HTSUS. Although
the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this
investigation is dispositive.

Period of Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation (POI) is May 1, 1993, through October 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Best Information Available
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the preliminary determination, we have based the duty deposit rate for all exporters other than the three
identified above (the ``all others'' rate) on best information available (BIA). One exporter, Abel Industries,
indicated that it would not participate in the investigation. Further, given that information has not been presented
to the Department to demonstrate otherwise, Abel and all other PRC companies not participating in this investigation
are not entitled to separate dumping margins. As such, because Abel decided not to participate in this investigation,
we are basing the ``All Others'' rate, which will also apply to Abel, on BIA. This is similar to our use of the BIA-based
``All Others'' rate in other recent antidumping duty investigations. (See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at
Less-Than-Fair-Value: Silicon Carbide From the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (Silicon Carbide)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns less adverse margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse
assumptions for those respondents that did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel
Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993), when a company
refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's
investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin
alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. Here, since at
least one PRC exporter failed to respond to our questionnaire, and because we presume all exporters to be centrally
controlled absent verified information to the contrary, we are assigning a margin of 126.94 percent (the highest
margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department for methodological inconsistencies at the time of the initiation
of this case) as BIA to all exporters other than those responding exporters which have shown their independence from
control in common with one or more other exporters of the subject merchandise.

Separate Rates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three participating exporters, ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng, have each requested a separate rate. ZMEC and ZLIP are
companies owned by ``all the people'' and for five of the six months of the POI, Lansheng also was owned by ``all the people.''
In the sixth month, Lansheng was restructured into a share company. To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent
to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department employs the criteria developed in the Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (Sparklers) and amplified
in

De Jure Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PRC laws placed on the record of this case establish that the responsibility for managing companies owned by ``all
the people'' has been transferred from the government to the enterprise itself. These laws include: ``Law of the People's
Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (1988 Law); ``Regulations
for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992
(1992 Regulations); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December
21, 1992 (Export Provisions). The 198l8 Law states that enterprises have the right to set their own prices (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article 26). This principle was restated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1992 Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article IX). The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Paper clips do not appear
on the Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to the constraints of these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determined that the existence of these laws demonstrates that ZMEC and ZLIP,
companies owned by ``all the people,'' are not subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Lansheng was initially a company owned by ``all the people,'' the laws cited above establish that the government
devolved control over Lansheng by law. The only additional law that may be pertinent to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 analysis of Lansheng as a share company is the Company Law (effective July 1, 1994). While Lansheng indicated that
it was organized consistent with the Company Law, the law did not enter into force until nine months after the POI. In
any event, this law does not alter the government's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 devolution of control that occurred when the company was owned by ``all the people.'' Therefore, we have determined
that Lansheng is not subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of reports
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 indicating that laws shifting control control from the government to the enterprises themselves have not been implemented
uniformly, an analysis of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of verification, we confirmed that ZEMC's export prices are neither set by, nor subject to approval,
by any government authority. This point was supported by ZMEC's sales documentation and company correspondence.
We also confirmed, based on examination of documents related to sales negotiations, written agreements and other
correspondence, that ZMEC has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements independent of
government authority. We further found that ZMEC retained proceeds from its export sales and made independent decisions
regarding disposition of profits and financing of losses. ZMEC's financial and accounting records as well as joint
venture and purchase contracts supported this conclusion. Finally, we have determined that ZMEC has autonomy from
the central government in making decisions regarding the selection of management. Although ZMEC's appointment
of management is acknowledged by the Zhejiang Machinery Bureau (ZMB), we have concluded that this does not constitute
control by ZMB. Based on our examination of minutes of management nomination meetings, appointment announcements
and correspondence between ZMEC and ZMB, verification established that the ZMB's involvement in ZMEC's management
appointment process reflects nothing more than an administrative formality
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
. Furthermore, based on examination of correspondence files, we found no evidence of involvement by Zhejiang Commission
of foreign and Economic cooperation (ZCOFTEC), or any other government authority, in any aspect of ZMEC's operations.
For these reasons, we have determined that ZMEC is not subject to

During verification, our examination of correspondence and sales documentation revealed no evidence that ZLIP's
export prices are set, or subject to approval, by any governmental authority. That ZLIP has the authority to negotiate
and sign contracts and other agreements independent of any government authority was evident from our examination
of correspondence and written agreements and contracts. We also confirmed that ZLIP retained proceeds from its export
sales and made independent decisions regarding disposition of profits and financing of losses (based on our examination
of bank account records, financial records, and purchase contracts).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our examination of management appointment announcements and other correspondence, we have determined
that ZLIP had autonomy from the central government in making decisions regarding the selection of management. According
to ZLIP's company charter, both the general manager and the deputy general manager are appointed by the local administering
authority, the ZCOFTEC. While this may indicate that ZLIP is subject to the control of ZCOFTEC, there is no evidence
that any other exporter of the subject merchandise, is currently under the control of ZCOFTEC. Therefore, we have
concluded that ZLIP is entitled to a separate rate.

All non-responding exporters are presumed to be under the control of the central government. Moreover, there is no
basis on which to conclude that Abel, the only exporter that has not participated in this proceeding, in subject to
control by ZCOFTEC. Abel is located in Shenzhen Province, and ZCOFTEC is an agency of Zhejiang Province. Therefore,
there is no basis to conclude that any non-responding exporter is controlled by ZCOFTEC. ZMEC, also located within
Zhejiang Province, is not subject to such control by ZCOFTEC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 analysis of Lansheng, we have examined the factors set forth in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Silicon Carbide,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and whether the change in corporate structure alters our conclusion regarding those factors. Lansheng's sales documentation
and correspondence supports the conclusion that no government entity exercises control over Lansheng's export
prices. Additionally, our examination of numerous contracts with domestic and foreign trading companies demonstrates
that Lansheng has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements without interference from any
governmental entity. We confirmed during verification that this situation did not change after Lansheng became
a share company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before Lensheng became a share company, the general manager of its predecessor company, Shanghai Stationery &amp;
Sporting Goods Import and Export Company (Shanghai Stationery), was elected on February 27, 1993. The election proceeded
in the following manner. First, for every ten employees, there was one elected representative. Second, the representatives
then elected the general manager. Third, once the general manager was elected, the company sent a letter, announcing
the election to the Shanghai Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Shanghai COFTEC). Shanghai COFTEC
then approved the manager and sent a letter of congratulation to the company. While Shanghai COFTEC technically had
the authority to reject an elected manager, it reportedly had never done so. After Lansheng became a share company,
the same manager continued to lead the company. At the first general shareholder's meeting, when Lansheng's Board
of Directors was elected, the shares held by the State Assets Management Bureau (SAMB) were voted by the general manager
of the former company, Shanghai Stationery. Subsequently, the newly elected Board of Directors appointed the former
general manager as Chairman of the Board for Lansheng (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Final Concurrence Memorandum in this proceeding, which attaches the Department's report of its verification
of Lansheng in the Antidumping Investigation of Certain Cased Pencils from the PRC). There is no evidence that any
government entity participated in the election of the Board of Directors or the decision to retain current management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also found that Lansheng retained proceeds from export sales and made independent decisions regarding the disposition
of profits and financing of losses both before and after becoming a share company. This point was supported through
examination of Lansheng's bank account records and bank loan applications. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lansheng's verification report.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, Lansheng's change to a share company did not have any effect on the actual day-to-day operations.
The record shows that, following its conversion to a share company, 25.1 percent of Lansheng's shares were sold publicly,
with the proceeds returning to the company as new capital investment. The remaining 74.9 percent of the shares represents
the value of the assets in the original company, Shanghai Stationery (which was owned by ``all the people''). Evidence
on the record indicates that these remaining shares are held in trust by the SAMB, just as its assets were held in trust
when Lansheng was owned by ``all the people.'' The company's management, which has remained the same throughout its
transition to a share company, votes these shares at the general shareholders' meetings of Lansheng. This evidence
supports the conclusion that, under the new corporate structure, the government has not exerted control over Lansheng
through the exercise of shareholder rights or otherwise; operational control remains in the hands of company management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of ZMEC and Lansheng, the record demonstrates an absence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 government control. With respect to ZLIP, we have determined that ZLIP is not controlled by the central government
and that, although ZLIP may be controlled by ZCOFTEC, ZCOFTEC does not control any other PRC exporter of paper clips.
Accordingly, we determine that each should receive a separate rate.

Fair Value Comparisons
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales by the three responding exporters of paper clips from the PRC to the United States were made
at less-than-fair-value prices, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified
in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USP and ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng was calculated on the same basis as in the preliminary determination. The following
adjustments were made to the reported U.S. sales of these exporters pursuant to our findings at verification (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

adjustments):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;We adjusted foreign inland freight for ZMEC based on verified distances between factory and port of exportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;Minor adjustments were also made to ZMEC's reported ocean freight and marine insurance charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;We adjusted ZLIP's and ZMEC's respective USP for unreported bank transactions fees based on findings at
verification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;In the case of ZMEC, three unreported sales were discovered at verification which were verified and included
in the final determination. Commission fees related to these unreported sales were verified and also included in
the final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;Several CIF sales reported by ZMEC were clarified and verified as C&amp;F sales and considered as such for
the final determination.

Foreign Market Value
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated FMV based on factors of production cited in the preliminary determination, making adjustments based
on verification findings (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Calculation Memorandum). To calculate FMV, the verified factor amounts were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate
values for the different inputs. We have used the same surrogate values used in the preliminary determination with
the exception of nickel and sodium hydroxide. Instead of using the value for non-alloy nickel bar, we used for this
final determination the value for unwrought nickel, which was found to be the form of nickel used for plating purposes.
We also used a surrogate value for sodium hydroxide in liquid (rather than solid flake) form based on verification
findings. We correctly valued two other proprietary factors whose names had been incorrectly reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on verification, we adjusted certain factors' values to reflect the actual purity used in the production of
subject merchandise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have adjusted the surrogate inland freight charge for transporting factor inputs from supplier to factory to reflect
the surrogate value for the actual quantity being transported. We recalculated inland freight distances between
factory and input supplier based on verified distances for Jiaxing and Fengbin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Wuyi and Jiaxing, we used verified packing factor amounts to calculate packing cost for the final calculations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of Fengbin, three additional proprietary factors of production were identified after the preliminary
determination. These factors were verified and considered for the final determination. In addition, factors of
production, labor and energy used in electroplating subject merchandise were adjusted to reflect allocation based
on actual electroplating process time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of Jiaxing, verification findings made it possible to calculate type-specific FMVs for No. 1 and Giant
paper clips for the final determination. Reported direct labor was adjusted based on verification findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of Wuyi, total reported clip production was found to be overstated at verification and adjustments to factors
of production were made accordingly. For certain factors, adjustments were made to reflect actual amounts consumed
during the POI instead of simple averages. Adjustments were also made to material, labor and electricity factors
used in electroplating subject merchandise, to reflect actual quantities consumed for paper clip plating during
the POI. We also made a downward adjustment to reported electricity usage in the clip production process based on verification
findings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the factors of production, to the extent possible, in
one or more market economy countries that are (1) at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market
economy country, and (2) significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that India
and Pakistan are the countries most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development. (See memorandum
from the Office of Policy to the file, dated November 29, 1993.) Although India is the preferred surrogate country
for purposes of calculating the factors of production, we have resorted to Pakistan for certain surrogate values
where Indian values were either unavailable or significantly outdated. We have obtained and relied upon published,
publicly available information, wherever possible.

Comment 1: PRC Exporters and Separate Rates

ZMEC and ZLIP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that ZLIP and ZMEC are both subject to control by one or more government agencies in the Zhejiang
Province. Since the ZCOFTEC has the authority under the company charter to appoint ZLIP's general manager and deputy
general manager, petitioners contend that ZLIP's operations are overseen by ZCOFTEC. Petitioners argue that ZMEC
also is under the supervision of the ZCOFTEC since ZCOFTEC communicates with ZMEC, an export trading company located
in the Zhejiang province. Petitioners also note that ZMEC's appointment of its general manager is subject to approval
by another Zhejiang province government agency, the ZMB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents counter that little evidence is provided to support Petitioners' claim that ZMEC and ZLIP are both subject
to the control of the ZCOFTEC and the ZMB. The fact that the ZCOFTEC communicates to all export trading companies in
the Zhejiang province does not evince governmental control over the companies' operations. with respect to ZMB,
respondents argue that the ZMB's role is also limited to the communication of market information, and statistical
services to companies in the machinery industry. Even though the ZMB has the right under law to object to any general
manager nomination, respondents state that this responsibility does not allow the ZMB total control over ZMEC's
operations. In fact, no evidence was found to indicate that the ZMB has ever actually exercised that right in the case
of ZMEC. Furthermore, respondents note that evidence on the record regarding other aspects of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control demonstrates that both ZLIP and ZMEC clearly are independent from central or provincial government control.
Both companies act independently without governmental interference in setting their own export prices, negotiating
contracts and agreements, and disposing of profits and financing of losses. Respondents argue that the ``totality
of information'' contradicts petitioners' assertions that ZLIP and ZMEC are controlled by the governmental body
and therefore, should not be assigned company-specific, separate rates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 evidence of Lansheng's independence from government control. The fact that the SAMB holds 74.5 percent of the shares
in Lansheng allows the SAMB to have absolute control over the selection of the company board of directors and the appointment
of the company's general managers and chairman of the board. Because the SAMB, a governmental agency, has control
over the company's operations, petitioners argue, Lansheng should not be considered for a separate rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondents argue that the record shows the role of the SAMB in the operation of Lansheng to be extremely limited. The
shares held by the SAMB are ``entrusted'' to the management of the company and, therefore, the SAMB's role is similar
to that of an ``inactive investor'', or title holder. Respondents point to the fact that Lansheng will be free to sell
all of its shares to the public within three years as an indication of the limited role of the SAMB during Lansheng's
transition from a state-owned company to a share company. Respondents state that the functions of the board of directors
and general manager are not governed by the SAMB but are defined in the company's articles of association. Respondents
contend that petitioners fail to recognize that the Department considers evidence relating to all aspects of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control and does not necessarily preclude a respondent from a separate rate based on information dealing with one
aspect of governmental control. According to respondents, evidence regarding other factors of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control further demonstrates that Lansheng's operations are not subject to governmental control by the SAMB or any
other governmental entity. Therefore, respondents argue, Lansheng should be given a separate rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that only a fraction of the manufacturers and sellers of paper clips in the PRC during the POI participated
in the investigation, and cite several firms which were listed in the petition and submissions by respondents that
did not respond to the questionnaire. Two of these firms are reported as being located in Zhejiang Province, where
ZLIP and ZMEC are located. Petitioners cite several cases stating that all PRC firms owned by the same governmental
authority, and which produced or sold the subject merchandise during the POI, must cooperate in the investigation
in order for respondent firms to receive a separate rate from the Department (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales
at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic of China (HSLW) (58 FR 48833, September
20, 1993)). Because certain firms mentioned in previous submissions did not participate in the investigation, petitioners
assert that it is impossible for the Department to determine that the respondent firms seeking a separate rate are
actually independent and not related to any other, unidentified or non-participating PRC company involved in the
production and sale of the subject merchandise to the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng argue that the Department should not preclude them from receiving their own company-specific
separate rate simply because other potentially state-owned paper clip manufactures and exporters did not respond
to the Department's questionnaire. Respondents cite Silicon Carbide, wherein ``state-ownership'' is not considered
to be indicative of common control by a single entity. Respondents assert that any state-owned company is entitled
to a separate rate if it can prove absence of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control by a government entity. Firms which refuse to participate or which do not satisfy the above-mentioned separate
rates test are assumed to be under central government control and are assigned a country-wide ``all-others'' rate.
Respondents assert that AMEC, ALIP and Lansheng have established that there is an absence of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with respondents that each participating exporter in this investigation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng) is entitled to its company-specific separate rate regardless of whether other potential
PRC exporters and sellers of subject merchandise participated in this investigation. Petitioners' concern that
all firms that produced paper clips during the POI did not participate in the investigation is misplaced. Each of the
three exporters investigated established that they were independent of any central government control and, therefore,
received a company-specific separate rate. The ``all other'' exporters are presumed to be under central government
control and, therefore, received a single rate, which, in this case, was based on BIA due to Abel's failure to respond
to the questionnaire (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Best Information Available'' section of this notice, above). Because the ``all other'' exporters are presumed
to be under central government control and the three responding companies have established that they are not under
central government control, the responding firms and the ``all other'' exporters are not within a common sphere of
control.

Comment 3: Choice of ``All-Others'' Rate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners assert that the Department incorrectly calculated the margin to be used as the ``all-others'' rate in
the preliminary determination by using the information set forth in the October 13, 1993, petition. Petitioners
assert that the Department should have chosen the highest margin (150.00 percent) set forth in the petition, as amended
on January 26, 1994. According to petitioners, the margin resulting from the amended petition is based on Petitioners'
updated values for certain chemicals used to plate paper clips. Petitioners claim that the January 26, 1994, submission
clarified that the values which the Department had disregarded in adjusting the petition for initiation purposes
were not being used as ``surrogate values'' in the manner in which the Department might apply Indian and Pakistani
values. Petitioners state that the values set forth in the amended petition's exhibits reflect the actual experience
of an affiliate of one of the petitioners in producing wire paper clips in Mexico. Those values were provided because,
given the specialized nature of the particular inputs, petitioners were unable to obtain publicly available published
information from an appropriate surrogate country. By basing these values on the actual experience of petitioners'
affiliate, petitioners claim to have followed the established practice of the Department to permit a petitioner
in an antidumping case to base certain values and costs on petitioners' own experience. Petitioners cited to several
past cases to support this argument (e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from
the People's Republic of China (Sebacic Acid) (58 FR 37908, May 31, 1994)).

Respondents request that the Department continue to reject petitioners' unsubstantiated and untimely petition
amendments for purposes of determining the ``all others'' rate. According to respondents, the amended data submitted
by petitioners should not be accepted by the Department since the data is from a Mexican affiliate and this does not
satisfy the requirement that costs submitted under the rubric of ``petitioners' data'' be based on U.S. cost. Second,
respondents contend that the amended data should not be considered for the final determination since petitioners
did not demonstrate that Mexico qualifies as a reasonable surrogate country for the PRC. Finally, respondents claim
that petitioners' amendments to the petition were filed in an untimely fashion.

We agree with respondents and will continue to use the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department
in the initiation notice (126.94 percent). Petitioners failed to provide any explanation or documentation of their
efforts to find surrogate country value information. Moreover, petitioners' use of Mexican values is tantamount
to selecting Mexico as a surrogate country, regardless of how petitioners choose to characterize their intentions.
Petitioners never explicitly stated why their use of Mexican values is appropriate in light of the Department's hierarchy
for selecting surrogate country economies.

Comment 4: Application of BIA/``All Others'' Rate to Respondents Who Did Not Sell Subject Merchandise to the United
States During the POI
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents request that the Department not apply the ``all others'' rate based on BIA to the ten PRC companies that
responded to the Department's November 4, 1993, survey advising that they had not shipped the subject merchandise
to the U.S. during the POI. Because the ``no-shipment'' companies responded to the Department's survey and were cooperative,
respondents argue that the Department should modify the ``all others'' rate with respect to these companies. Respondents
note that the Department did not issue further questionnaires to these companies or otherwise indicate that these
responses were considered to be incomplete. Moreover, respondents assert that the Department was not precluded
from verifying the statements of the ``no-shipment'' companies. Respondents cite

 where the Court of Appeals Federal Circuit held that ``a `No' answer is a complete answer.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, respondents contend, these ten companies complied with Department regulations and should not be given
the same BIA rate as respondents which refused to respond to the Department's questionnaires entirely. Respondents
argue that these companies should be considered cooperative respondents and should not be assigned a margin based
on BIA. Instead, respondents request that these ten companies be given a margin based on a weighted-average of the
other participating exporters' margins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners assert that respondents' request that the Department modify the ``all others'' rate for the ten ``no-shipment''
companies should not be granted. First, petitioners state that the Department's recent determinations involving
the PRC assigned companies a rate based on the highest margin stated in the petition because the companies in question
were unable to show entitlement to a separate rate. Petitioners contend that claims by these PRC firms that they did
not produce or sell paper clips exported to the U.S. during the POI is not factual information that can be used by the
Department to calculate an appropriate antidumping margin. Petitioners further argue that any reference to the
use in past cases of a weighted-average of other respondents' margins are inapposite, because the cited determinations
do no discuss a method for assigning an antidumping duty rate to companies which did not submit factual information.
In addition, petitioners state the 1991 determinations cited by respondents have been superseded by more recent
decisions by the Department, in which the highest margin alleged in the petition was selected for firms deemed ineligible
for a separate rate. Petitioners also maintain that the respondents' assertion that the application of the highest
margin alleged in the petition to the no-shipping firms constitutes punitive ``BIA'' is incorrect. Petitioners
counter that the Department regulations authorize the reliance on factual information submitted in support of the
petition, if the Department does not receive a complete, accurate, and timely response to its request for factual
information. Given the lack of factual information from the non-shipping firms, petitioners maintain that the Department
properly assigned to those firms an ``all others'' rate based on factual information from the petition. Finally,
petitioners argue that to give the non-participating firms a rate based on an average of separate rates assigned to
the respondent exporters would reward companies that remained outside of the Department's investigation. Such
firms, by not participating, would actually receive a margin that is lower than half of the responding firms which
submitted factual information.

We agree with petitioners. Even though the ten companies reported that they made no sales of subject merchandise to
the U.S. during the POI, the companies did not take the opportunity to answer the ownership and government control
questions presented in the November 3, 1993, survey and/or complete the Separate Rates attachment of the Department's
questionnaire, which the Department issued both to PRC government agencies and directly to all but one
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 of the ten companies. The companies did not respond to the Department's requests for factual information in an accurate
and timely fashion. On the contrary, the companies did not submit any factual information pertaining to their respective
ownership and control status to demonstrate that they are eligible for a separate rate. Therefore, we reject respondents'
request to modify the ``all others'' rate for the ten ``no-shipment'' companies.

Comment 5: Double-Counting of Indirect Expenses in Manufacturers' FMV Calculations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents claim that the Department's preliminary calculation includes the cost of chemical factor inputs used
in the electroplating stage of paper clip production both in the cost of manufacture (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 raw material valuation) and in factory overhead (which was based on an industry-specific income statement in the
Reserve Bank of India Bulletin). Respondents believe that all materials, other than steel, nickel and nickel sulfate,
should be treated by the Department in its final determination as indirect, not direct materials, According to respondents,
these remaining chemicals are used to bathe the unfinished products during the electroplating stage and are not actually
incorporated into the finished product and, therefore, are properly included in factory overhead. In support of
this, respondents cite the Final Determination of Extruded Rubber Thread from Malaysia (57 FR 38465, August 25, 1992)
which stated that a particular input ``is properly treated as variable overhead rather than a direct cost because
if is not part of the finished good.'' Specifically, respondents claim that the factory overhead components of the
income statement included the item ``other manufacturing expenses.'' Respondents maintain that although the income
statement includes a separate line for ``raw materials, components, etc. consumed'', it does not contain any similar
category for indirect materials. Respondents cite additional cases to note the treatment of indirect materials
in past NME cases and request the Department to correct its calculation of cost of manufacture by including only direct
materials in the final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that the chemical materials used in the electroplating process should be treated as direct materials
in the final determination because respondents have failed to provide any evidence that double-counting actually
did occur. Furthermore, petitioners assert that respondents' argument that plating chemicals are indirect materials
is based on a faulty premise that the chemicals are not physically incorporated into the finished product. According
to petitioners, the chemicals which form the bath used to plate the clips are actually incorporated into the clips
by ensuring the nickel remains attached to the wire. Without these chemicals, the nickel would not stay on the wire.
Petitioners further cite several cases involving the PRC where chemicals used in plating were valued as direct materials.
Petitioners request that the Department follow prior determinations and treat plating chemicals as direct materials.

in the plating process are actually included in the factory overhead category of ``other manufacturing expenses.''
Therefore, we have treated the chemical inputs as direct materials for the calculations in the final determination.

Comment 6: Treatment of Chemical Inputs Having Lower Concentration Levels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Department decides to value plating chemicals as direct materials, respondents request the Department to
adjust the surrogate values of those chemicals (which respondents contend represent values for undiluted products)
to reflect verified actual concentration levels of chemicals used by the manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner argue that no authority exists for the Department to adjust its surrogate value calculations to reflect
the concentration levels of chemical inputs used by the manufacturers because the Department would have to make an
assumption regarding the purity level of the surrogate value selected. In this case, petitioners contend that there
is no information on the record to base the percentage of purity of each of the published values.

strengths based on the Condensed Chemical Dictionary as the most reasonable method for valuing purity concentration
of these chemical factors for commercial use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents contend that the surrogate values for nickel and nickel sulfate used in the preliminary determination
are unreasonable because they represent a price which is approximately four times the international market price
of those inputs. Therefore, respondents request the Department to revise its calculations for the final determination
to adjust the surrogate values for nickel and nickel sulfate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners assert that respondents have not standing to criticize the use of the surrogate values since respondents
failed to submit any information on publicly available published information in a timely manner, as requested by
the Department. Moreover, petitioners contend that in past cases involving the PRC, the Department has maintained
that to reject Indian surrogate values simply because respondents allege that those values did not reflect world
market prices would be overly subjective on the part of the Department (

 After consulting with nickel specialists and conducting independent research, it was discovered that unwrought

In order not to overstate the value of nickel used in the plating process of paper clips, we have used the basket category
for unwrought nickel in the Indian Import Statistics, to calculate the surrogate value of nickel used in the plating
process for the final determination. Because we have learned nothing to call into question the surrogate value used
for nickel sulfate, the value used for that factor remains unchanged.

Petitioners note the failure by ZMEC to report relevant sales during the POI and to account for downward adjustments,

Petitioners assert that the Department should use the Indian value for semi-skilled labor, rather than that of unskilled

respondents have failed to support their claim that all labor used in the process was unskilled is not supported by
any evidence on the record.

Respondents request that the Department use the packing amounts verified at the manufacturers when calculating
the manufacturers' packing material expenses in the final determination. While packing material and packing labor
were verified at Jiaxing and Wuyi, only packing labor was verified at Fengbin. Respondents request that the Department
use an average of packing materials data (from the other two manufacturers), rather than punitive data, for the final
determination with respect to Fengbin's packing materials. Respondents assert that the Department should grant
this request since Fengbin provided complete responses to the Department's questionnaires which were substantially
verified. Furthermore, according to respondents, the use of an average of the verified packing material amounts
would more accurately reflect the experiences of the PRC manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners request that the Department base its calculation of packing expenses on surrogate value information

the petition for Fengbin's packing materials.

such a deficiency. Therefore, we continue to use the petition's packing material value as BIA for Fengbin's packing
expenses in the final margin calculations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NOAA Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) announces its intent to evaluate the performance
of the Pennsylvania Coastal Management Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The evaluation will be conducted pursuant to section 312 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), as amended.
The CZMA requires a continuing review of the performance of coastal states with respect to coastal management. Evaluation
of Coastal Management Programs requires findings concerning the extent to which a state has adhered to the CMP Management
Plan approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and adhered to the terms of financial assistance awards funded under the
CZMA. The evaluation will include a site visit, consideration of public comments, and consultations with interested
Federal, State, and local agencies and member of the public. A public meeting will be held as part of the site visit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pennsylvania Coastal Management Program evaluation site visit will be from November 14 to November 18, 1994.
A public meeting will be held Tuesday, November 15, 1994 at 7:00 pm, at the City of Erie City Council Chambers, 60 State
Street, Erie, Pennsylvania 16507.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State will issue notice of the public meeting in a local newspaper(s) at least 45 days prior to the public meeting,
and will issue other timely notices as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the State's most recent performance reports, as well as OCRM's notifications and supplemental request
letters to the States, are available upon request from OCRM. Written comments from interested parties regarding
this program are encouraged and will be accepted until 15 days after the site visit. Please direct written comments
to Vickie A. Allin, Chief, Policy Coordination Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, NOS/NOAA,
1305 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910. When the evaluation is completed, OCRM will place a notice
in the

On May 19, 1994, notice was published (59 FR 26211) that an application had been filed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(P45N) to take listed shortnose sturgeon for hatchery and genetic research. Notice is hereby given that on September
2, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543), NMFS
denied this application for the above taking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Denial of this application was based on a finding that such application: (1) Was not consistent with the proposed policy
of NMFS and FWS on controlled propagation of listed species; (2)&blank;contained research activities that are not
part of an approved recovery plan; (3) did not contain a specific research proposal; (4) might operate to the disadvantage
of the listed species which is the subject of the application. This application was denied in accordance with and is
subject to parts 217&hyph;222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application, letter of denial, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons
in the following offices, by appointment:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The study, named the Headwaters Revitalization Study, was addressed generally by an integrated feasibility report
and final Environmental Impact Statement filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency January 17, 1992 (57
FR 2093). The present study is to formulate a plan to optimize environmental improvements to the Upper Kissimmee Basin
while re-establishing discharges to the Lower Basin that are necessary to restore the ecological integrity of the
Kissimmee River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Increasing the levels of Lakes Kissimmee, Cypress and Hatchineah is under study. A preliminary proposal is to increase
the controlled upper water level from 52.5 to 54.0 feet NGVD, with the lower level remaining at 48.5 feet NGVD. Additionally,
the scheduled would be zoned to provide discharges based on season and water levels. The revised schedule would seasonally
reflood land between elevations 52.5 and 54.0 feet in the Upper Basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised schedule is expected to increase seasonal water storage capacity by 100,000 acre-feet, according to
studies by the SFWMD, and to provide for greater, and more natural fluctuations of water levels in the lakes. Additionally,
the studied regulation schedule is expected to provide capability to simulate the historic seasonal flow from Lake
Kissimmee to the Lower Basin. This capability is a prerequisite for successful restoration of the Lower Basin ecosystem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative plans consist of ``no action,'' i.e., leaving the existing Upper Basin works in place and operating with
the present schedules, and combinations of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different modifications of the Upper Chain of Lakes regulation schedules, C&hyph;34, C&hyph;35, C&hyph;36, and
C&hyph;37 enlargement, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acquistion of real estate interests to acquire rights to reflood land below evaluation 54.0 feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study will address the effects of higher water levels on private property, agricultural and commercial interests,
public works, cultural resources including historical structures, recreation, aesthetics, water quality, and
fish and wildlife in the Upper Basin and effects on the Kissimmee River Restoration Plan. Tributary lakes Rosalie,
Tiger and Jackson may be affected by the studied change, and effects on these lakes will also be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping of this study was started with a letter dated July 16, 1992, to all known interested parties, based on responses
to the integrated feasibility report and final EIS cited above. The letter described the studied action and reasonable
alternatives conceived at that time. The public and affected state and federal agencies will be further involved
in scoping through workshops to obtain information and concerns from agencies and the public and to share planning
concepts and procedures. The workshops have not been scheduled, but will be announced through mailings and public
media notices. Additionally, a series of public hearings will be scheduled after circulation of the draft report
and EIS and before completion of the final reports and EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study is being conducted with the participation of the South Florida Water Management District (local sponsor),
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, Florida Department of Natural
Resources, and Florida Department of Environmental Regulation. The U.S. Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation
Service has met with planners and expressed concerns over the potential seasonal loss of wetland pasturage and the
effect on water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. Further participation is invited from federal, state and local
agencies, affected Indian tribes, and other private organizations and parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Project Modification Report and DEIS are scheduled for availability to the public in March 1995.

along the Little Calumet River in Lake County, in northwestern Indiana. The overall project is discussed in a Final
EIS released in July 1982; changes in levee alignments are discussed in an Environmental Assessment (EA) issued in
July 1994. The upcoming SEIS will discuss (in greater detail) the changes covered in the July 1994 EA. Alternatives
include (but are not limited to) no action and levee/floodwall construction. Changes to be discussed in the SEIS affect
levees/flooodwalls at 24 locations in the project area.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision (ROD) To Approve the Miramar Landfill General Development Plan (GDP) and Phase I Projects Including
the Fiesta Island Replacement Project/Northern Sludge Processing Facility (FIRP/NSPF) and West Miramar Landfill
Overburden Disposal (WMLOD), at Naval Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its decision to approve the
Miramar Landfill General Development Plan (GDP) proposed to be implemented within the boundaries of Naval Air Station
(NAS) Miramar; and, more specifically, approve a land lease agreement with the City of San Diego. The GDP provides
a comprehensive framework for several related waste management projects which are proposed to be implemented in
three phases over the course of several years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the intent of 40 CFR 1500.4(i), the environmental impact statement (EIS) analysis for the GDP used
a tiered approach to provide: (1) Programmatic consideration of the overall framework of the GDP; and, (2) detailed,
project-specific analysis of the GDP-Phase I elements which are proposed for near-term implementation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This ROD addresses the Department of the Navy approval of the Preferred Alternative identified in Parts I and II of
the Draft and Final EIS, with some refinements related to the phased implementation of specific elements. Alternatives
to the overall GDP and alternatives to the Phase I project-specific elements were described in the EIS and are summarized
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
GDP Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed GDP encompasses a variety of projects including the relocation or modification of several existing
facilities at the Miramar Landfill and the development of several new facilities. Relocated/modified facilities
include: Recycling center, greens/woods recycling operation, landfill entrance fee booth, vehicle maintenance
facility, fuel pipeline, and the landfill access road. New facilities include a sludge processing facility and related
pipelines/utilities, a materials recovery facility, an access road to new facilities, an environmental complex,
a cogeneration plant, a paper processing plant, a household hazardous waste processing station, a public tipping
deck, landfill siltation basins, and a landscaping/revegetation nursery. The GDP also includes projects related
to the mounding of grading overburden at three locations within the study area. The three mounding areas are proposed
on the closed South Miramar Landfill and are referred to by their relative location on the landfill: North, West, and
East Mounding Areas. Approximately six million cubic yards of overburden from excavation of the West Miramar Landfill
is proposed to be placed at the three mounding areas. In addition, approximately 540,000 cubic yards of overburden
from the grading of the proposed sludge processing facility will be mounded at the West Mounding Area. Use of the North
Mounding Area will occur as described in the EIS. Use of the North Mounding Area will occur as described in the EIS. Use
of the East and West Mounding Areas will occur according to project phasing modifications described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed GDP includes elements which are integral parts of a comprehensive program for the management of solid
and liquid waste by the City of San Diego (City). The various elements of the GDP serve to meet specific waste management
needs of the City and to comply with state and federal requirements for wastewater treatment standards, landfill
operation standards, recycling, and hazardous waste collection. A key benefit and emphasis of the GDP relates to
centralized collocation of the GDP elements. Examples of the efficiencies and benefits of the collocation aspect
of the GDP were provided in Part I of the EIS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The No Action Alternative was considered within the EIS. This alternative was rejected because, without implementation
of the GDP, the objective of an integrated waste management program for the City would not be met. This would result
in inefficiencies and inabilities in dealing with the ongoing waste management needs of the City and would continue
legal, environmental, and regulatory conflicts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative sites were considered but rejected in favor of the Proposed Project because they failed to meet the basic
siting criteria. Such criteria include the site's ability to support all of the GDP elements so that the collocation
benefits are realized, the site's location being within the solid wasteshed it would serve, the site's location relative
to the ability to pipe/transfer sludge, and the City's current uses on the GDP site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative technologies for certain elements of the GDP were also considered. In general, they were found to be complimentary
to, rather than alternatives to, the technologies which are proposed within the GDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitigation measures for the proposed GDP are identified in the EIS. For Phase I elements of the GDP which are proposed
for near-term implementation, and where sufficient design specifications support a detailed examination of impacts,
specific mitigation requirements are identified within the project-specific analysis. For GDP elements which
are still in a conceptual stage, more generalized mitigation criteria are identified. In conjunction with the completion
of future Phase II project specific environmental documentation, a determination will be made whether further mitigation
requirements are warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed GDP Project is considered to be the environmentally preferred alternative. It is the only alternative
which meets the basic purpose, need, and objectives of the project. The mitigation framework of the Proposed GDP also
serves to substantially lessen potential environmental impacts by identifying specific requirements for the near-term
elements, establishing general mitigation criteria for the conceptual elements, and anticipating the development
of more detailed mitigation measures for future levels of planning.

FIRMP/NSPF and WMLOD Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part II of the EIS provided detailed consideration of two projects of the GDP comprising Phase I elements: (1) the Fiesta
Island Replacement Project/Northern Sludge Processing Facility (FIRP/NSPF); and (2) West Miramar Landfill Overburden
Disposal (WMLOD).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
FIRP/NSPF
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The key components of FIRP/NSPF include: (1) The FIRP/NSPF Site, a 30+ acre site, located northwest of the Convoy/SR&hyph;52
interchange, which will be developed with the storage tanks, centrifuges, sludge drying equipment, and associated
facilities for the treatment of sludge and biosolids from the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant and from the North
City Water Reclamation Plant (NCWRP); (2) FIRP/NSPF Overburden Disposal/Mounding_The excavation of approximately
540,000 cubic yards of earth from the FIRP/NSPF site and mounding of the overburden at the nearby west mound site; (3)
Access Road_Construction of a main access road from Convoy Street to the FIRP/NSPF site; and (4) FIRP/NSPF Pipeline
Corridor_A 4-mile pipeline route from Miramar Road to the FIRP/NSPF site for the installation of a parallel pipeline
system (e.g., one pipeline for sludge and one pipeline for reclaimed water) connecting to the NCWRP. Alternatives
for FIRP/NSPF include the No Action Alternative and several alternatives which are particular to the individual
elements of FIRP/NSPF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The No Action Alternative was rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on its failure to meet the basic purpose,
need and objectives of the project. It was also rejected because continued reliance on the existing Fiesta Island
sludge processing facility would result in a number of legal, technical, environmental, and land use conflicts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative sites for the FIRP/NSPF were considered in comparison to the Proposed Project. They were found to be either
more environmentally constrained, less efficient, or not as responsive to the basic project objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives for dealing with the site grading overburden were considered. They included mounding the overburden
on NAS Miramar and trucking overburden off the station. The onsite mounding alternative is the preferred alternative
based on fewer air quality and traffic impacts and reduced costs as compared to the offsite haul option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three alternatives for the site access road were analyzed: Northern Access Route; Central Access Route; and Southern
Access Route. The Southern Access Route with a temporary Central Construction Road is the alignment selected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative alignments of the FIRP/NSPF Pipeline Corridor were considered. The Proposed Pipeline Project achieves
the best balance of feasibility and environmental sensitivity, especially relative to avoiding coastal sage scrub
and vernal pools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, the Proposed FIRP/NSPF Project was found to be the only alternative which substantially minimize environmental
degradation and met the basic purpose, need, and objectives of the project. Therefore, it is considered to be the environmentally
preferred alternative.

WMLOD
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed WMLOD Project involves the disposal of approximately 6 million cubic yards of overburden associated
with approved, ongoing excavation at the West Miramar Landfill. The Proposed Project identifies mounding overburden
on three areas (the North, West, and East Mounding Areas) and transporting the overburden from the excavation area
to the mounding areas via an enclosed electric conveyor belt system mounted on steel trusses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A No Action Alternative was considered and rejected due to potential impacts associated with substantially reducing
or eliminating capacity of the West Miramar Landfill. An alternative of trucking the overburden offsite was considered
and rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on comparatively greater air quality impacts, traffic impacts,
and costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives for transporting the overburden onsite via scrapers on off-road routes or haul trucks on paved roads
were considered. They were rejected in favor of the Proposed Project based on greater impacts to biological resources
and greater air quality impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as discussed below, the proposed WMLOD project is considered to be the environmentally preferred alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
FIRP/NSPF and WMLOD Phasing Modification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the release of the Final EIS, a modification to the proposed phasing of the FIRP/NSPF and WMLOD projects has occurred.
The modification is a result of consultations between the City, the Department of the Navy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the California Department of Fish and Game relative to potential
direct and indirect impacts to biological resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City, the Department of the Navy, and the resources agencies recognize vernal pools as being a significant biological
resource and agree that impacts to such resources should be avoided when practicable and mitigated/compensated
when impacts are unavoidable. The Final EIS and the USFWS Biological Opinion for the project dated 29 September 1994
establish mitigation measures which address both direct and indirect impacts to vernal pools. Such requirements
include acquiring offsite vernal pools to compensate for the loss of onsite vernal pools and set forth mitigation
ratios based on the specific nature of the impacted vernal pool (i.e., mitigation ratio of 2:1 for impacts to vernal
pools on native soil, a 2:1 ratio for impacts to vernal pools containing San Diego fairy shrimp, a 1:1 ratio for impacts
to vernal pools located on landfill material and having two or more vernal pool indicator species, and a ratio of 0:1
for vernal pools on landfill material having less than two indicator species). The removal of onsite vernal pools
can only occur to the extent that the necessary offsite mitigation has been secured. The phasing modification enhances
the feasibility and timeliness of implementing these mitigation requirements for specific Phase 1 projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the FIRP/NSPF project, the phasing modification will result in the deferral of vernal pool impacts associated
with FIRP/NSPF overburden disposal. The modification would limit the placement of FIRP/NSPF overburden to only
the northeast portion of the West Mounding Area where there are no vernal pools. The modifications would also delete
the East Mound Area from use in Phase I implementation. In conjunction with the reduce ``footprint'' of the FIRP/NSPF
mound, the segment of the Southern Access Road which follows the base of the mound would be realigned to avoid most of
the existing vernal pools. These refinements to the grading program and the associated reduction in vernal pool impacts
enable the City to meet vernal pool mitigation requirements for FIRP/NSPF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postponement of WMLOD mounding at the West Mound location will delay the direct impacts to vernal pools and enable
the City to more fully address the vernal pool mitigation requirements currently set forth in the USFWS Biological
Opinion for the project. The ultimate implementation of the vernal pool mitigation requirements for the WMLOD West
Mound may be affected by additional regulatory consideration related to the removal of vernal pools as part of landfill
maintenance; however, any variation from the current Biological Opinion requirements for the WMLOD West Mound would
likely involve a new Section 7 consultation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reconsideration of mounding at the East Mound location will delay potential direct and indirect impacts to adjacent
vernal pools within the Miramar Mounds Natural Landmark until additional environmental documentation has been
prepared. Such information could be developed within the 3+ years of Phase I WMLOD activity. It is anticipated that
supplemental Section 7 consultation with the USFWS will be required to implement WMLOD activity proposed to occur
as Phase II/III projects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Biological Opinion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the opinion of the USFWS that the Proposed GDP and FIRP/NSPF/WMLOD Projects are not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of the coastal California gnatcatcher, least Bell's vireo, San Diego fairy shrimp, San Diego button-celery,
or San Diego mesa mint. Mandatory terms and conditions are included in the USFWS Biological Opinion and will be implemented
as part of the Project. The conclusions of the Biological Opinion are made for the following reasons: (1) Direct, indirect,
and cumulative impacts of this proposed action have been minimized and will be compensated; and (2) Direct impacts
to suitable habitat for these species represents a small percentage of the suitable habitat within San Diego County.
Key measures to mitigate impacts to biological resources, as embodied within the EIS and in the Terms and Conditions
of the USFWS Biological Opinion, include, but are not limited to: Resource avoidance measures such as clearly delineating
proposed limits of grading, controlling dust generation and potential erosion/sedimentation, educating construction
personnel about local biological resources and other measures to protect biological resources from direct and indirect
impacts of project development nearby; revegetation requirements for areas of temporary disturbance such as the
FIRP/NSPF pipeline corridor and the overburden disposal mounds; offsite resources acquisition to compensate for
onsite permanent loss of biological resources. This latter requirement particularly relates to vernal pool impacts
and provides for offsite vernal pool acquisition and/or restoration as mitigation for onsite impacts.

Mitigation Monitoring
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive mitigation monitoring program has been developed in conjunction with the EIS analysis of the GDP
and of the FIRP/NSPF and WMLOD projects and will be implemented through all phases of the project. A copy of the mitigation
monitoring program may be obtained at the address set forth below.

Clean Air Act Conformity Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations promulgated through 40 CFR Part 93, the Department
of the Navy included within the EIS an analysis of the project's conformity with the Clean Air Act. The analysis found
that the project emissions, both in terms of emissions for each element of the GDP and for the GDP as a whole (cumulative
emissions), would be below the de minimis levels established by the rule. It should be noted that while the ozone attainment
status for the San Diego Air Basin is currently being revised from ``Severe'' to ``Serious'', the de minimis finding
is based on the more restrictive standard (e.g., project total NOX emissions are less than the 25 tons per year (TPY)
standard for ``Severe'' nonattainment areas; which is well below the 50 TPY standard for ``Serious'' nonattainment
areas).

 Section 3517 of the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U. S. C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide interested
Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB may amend
or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval process
would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially interfere
with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information Resources
Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior to submission
of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following: (1) Type
of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection;
(4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public
comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Patrick J. Sherrill at the address
specified above.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial electric motor system end
users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system energy efficiency, productivity,
and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities and settings. Projects selected by
DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored (DOE) program that is
an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful results to be gained
from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with similar applications
to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration of efficient electric
motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MOTOR CHALLENGE program is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through increased market penetration
of efficient electric motor systems. It is expected that industry participants will achieve increased electric
motor system efficiency through the system integration of a variety of technology and application options including:
energy efficient electric motors, adjustable speed drives, and motor-driven equipment (e.g., pumps, fans, and
compressors) within industrial operations and processes. DOE is carrying out the MOTOR CHALLENGE program with industrial
and manufacturing companies, municipalities, electric motor and drive manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), distributors, utilities, energy service companies, research institutes, other Federal agencies, state
energy agencies, public interest groups, and other supporting organizations. DOE will be the Federal agency with
the responsibility of selecting Showcase Demonstration projects, and will then develop an Agreement between the
government and the respective selected companies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MOTOR CHALLENGE program was launched on October 19, 1993 by the Federal government (DOE) and industry with the
signing of the MOTOR CHALLENGE Compact (dated October 13, 1993). As stated within the MOTOR CHALLENGE Compact, DOE
would issue an appropriate notice to solicit participants in the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstrations. This
notice satisfies such a commitment by DOE. Projects selected as Showcase Demonstrations by DOE will be those of greater
interest as discussed under the Technical Evaluation Criteria and Review Process section. Project teams selected
to participate will receive a variety of technical assistance from DOE, but will not receive financial assistance
to implement the demonstration projects. Other projects that are evaluated and determined to be technically feasible
and interesting, but are not selected as Showcase Demonstrations, will be recognized by DOE for inclusion as MOTOR
CHALLENGE Case Study Briefs. All Case Study Brief project teams will be encouraged by DOE to continue their efficient
electric motor system deployment. All Case Study Brief teams will be informed of the Showcase Demonstration projects'
progress and experiences. The achievements and successful results from any Case Study Brief project can be recognized
through the voluntary reporting of the energy savings and the associated greenhouse gas emission reductions into
the DOE Electric Motor Systems Database by the industrial end-user project team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As one condition of proposing to be a Showcase Demonstration, DOE requires that each company, organization, and/or
agency of a proposing team, simultaneously join the MOTOR CHALLENGE Partnership by submitting an appropriately
completed application. (The availability of application forms is discussed in For Further Information Contact
section above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits of Industry Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry will receive many benefits to participating as a MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstration project team.
The principal benefit of participation is for an individual company to achieve energy efficiency, productivity,
and environmental performance goals faster than otherwise. This will primarily be accomplished by the adoption
of a ``systems approach'' in the way electric motor and drives are utilized within industrial operations and processes.
Participation in the Showcase Demonstration projects provides leveraged access to technical assistance, and more
reliable information. Participants will use the experiences of the Showcase Demonstrations to replicate opportunities
within similar applications. In addition, participants will gain national recognition for taking a leadership
role in a unique industry/government partnership. A secondary benefit of participation is to catalyze and to solidify
strategic alliances among team members that otherwise would be more difficult to initiate and/or to maintain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstration project teams will be provided the following technical
assistance and special access to DOE-funded activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Input to Development of Technical Tools and Best Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will support the development of design-decision tools, best practices, and guidelines on various electric motor
system application topics (e.g., motors, adjustable speed drives, pumps, fans, compressors, etc.). Teams will
provide input to DOE to ensure that the tools, materials, and procedures developed, appropriately meet industry's
design and decision-making, needs and requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Performance Validation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will pay for appropriate engineering consulting assistance to advise Showcase Demonstration teams on performance
validation issues. Working jointly with individual teams, the consultants will assist and advise teams on the development
and design of reliable experimental and performance measurement techniques so that the demonstration's costs and
benefits can be validated. At the completion of each project the engineering consultants will prepare an independent
performance validation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Case Study Documentation and Dissemination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will pay for the development and documentation of a comprehensive case history for each Showcase Demonstration,
and will disseminate the case study results subject to team member's and independent performance validator's review
and approval. Likewise, DOE will provide a compendium of Case Study Briefs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Access to Experts Group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through Oak Ridge National Lab, DOE will assemble an Experts Group of consultants, comprising of experts in, for example,
electric motors, drives, fluid handling equipment, specific process industries, power systems, etc. Reasonable
access to the Experts Group will be provided to the teams to acquire technical assistance and advice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Participation in Showcase Demonstration Workshops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Team members will be invited to DOE-sponsored workshops where all Showcase Demonstration teams will be provided
the opportunity to exchange valuable information and to discuss common implementation experiences with industry
counterparts. These workshops will also serve to inform participants of the latest available technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits to the Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The knowledge and experiences of the Showcase Demonstrations will be used in future DOE efforts to assist industry
in replicating and implementing efficient electric motor systems. DOE intends that the long-term result of highlighting
the exemplary and cost-effective benefits of the Showcase Demonstrations is the accelerated and increased market
penetration of efficient electric motor systems within U.S. industry. The deployment of efficient industrial electric
motor systems will contribute significantly to greater energy efficiency, reduced primary/source energy consumption,
deferred new power generation capacity, improved industrial productivity and competitiveness, and enhanced environmental
protection for the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Only industrial or municipal electric motor system ``end-users'' are eligible to submit project preliminary-proposals,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and for those preliminarily-selected as Showcase Demonstrations, final proposals. ``End-users'' are defined
as those companies who own and operate the facility where the demonstration will occur. In addition to end-user participation,
a project team may involve other partners including, but not limited to, motor and drive manufacturers, original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, utilities, energy service companies, state energy offices, research
institutions, etc. End-user proposers are encouraged to include such participation. Other non-end user entities
are also encouraged to catalyze and support preliminary-proposal submission by end-user project teams.

Industry Showcase Demonstration Project Team Obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each proposing project team will themselves provide all the funding to support necessary design, equipment specification,
purchase, and installation for the efficient electric motor systems to be demonstrated, along with all the measurement
equipment and instrumentation to validate and substantiate all claims of performance and benefits achieved. (A
limited amount of supplementary measurement equipment and instrumentation may be provided by DOE). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Teams will provide DOE with sufficient data to substantiate and document the energy and environmental performance
of the project and the economic benefit/cost of the result. Additionally, teams will provide appropriate information
to DOE to allow for DOE contractors to document a comprehensive case study and to perform an independent performance
validation. For activities within the Showcase Demonstration, DOE will respect all proprietary interests to which
selected demonstration hosts are entitled. These activities will be addressed in the previously referenced Agreement
between DOE and the project team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Showcase Demonstration Team's Intellectual Property Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agreements to be signed by DOE and each MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstration project team does not envision
a commitment by the Participants to perform research and development. DOE's intellectual property policies will
not apply to Participant's inventions because the work performed by the Participants in developing the demonstration
projects for the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstrations are not wholly or partially funded by DOE. Therefore, rights
to intellectual property developed by Participants and demonstrated at the MOTOR CHALLENGE Showcase Demonstrations
will not vest in the United States Government. Language to this effect will be incorporated into any resulting Agreement.

(b) The qualitative level of productivity gain and non-energy cost savings from the application;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The comparative significance of estimated energy cost savings were the demonstration to be replicated more broadly
at the facility and within the end-user's company. The opportunity for a demonstration to be replicated in like processes,
operations, and facilities, and the order of magnitude of the energy cost savings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Category 3) Energy and environmental impact for the company. The magnitude and technical basis of the energy resource
conservation and environmental benefits of the demonstration should be determined on a qualitative basis by considering
the impact on primary fuel consumption and utilization at the source, even if off-site. (The emission reductions
should be estimated very roughly by showing the relative types and relative amounts of fuels to be saved or used). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Category 4) Qualifications of critical personnel on the project team. The qualifications of key personnel on the
project will be evaluated in relation to their skills, work experience, and education relative to the required work
tasks to accomplish the proposed project.

Preliminary-Proposal Policy and Programmatic Factors and Applications of Greater Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will use policy and programmatic factors to select the preliminary-proposals of greater interest. To attempt
to ensure that a broadly representative group of proposals are selected, DOE will seek diversity in the Showcase Demonstrations
selected by considering: geographical location, application type, industry type, and facility size (e.g., annual
electricity costs) of the Showcase Demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE prefers proposals for projects that are no further along than the engineering design stage. However, if a project
is further along, DOE will consider the project as a Showcase Demonstration candidate, if a reliable and defendable
methodology of establishing a performance baseline of a conventional system is available. For example, if another
conventional system is currently operating, and a performance baseline of the conventional operating system can
be measured and reliably compared to the demonstration project, then this would be acceptable to DOE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has identified the following seven broad technical applications as those in which it is most interested in receiving
Showcase Demonstration proposals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Applications where new efficient electric motor and drive designs are creatively and cost-effectively integrated
within specific mechanical component systems (e.g., pumps, fans, compressors, etc.), or processes so as to yield
improved energy efficiency, productivity improvement, and reduced life-cycle cost relative to typical conventional
operating systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applications where an efficient electric motor and drive system replaces a less efficient heat-engine/mechanical
drive system (e.g., steam turbine) to yield primary energy savings, productivity improvement, and environmental
improvement both at the facility and on a global basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) New manufacturing production lines where state-of-the-art motor and drive system utilization results in energy
efficiency and productivity improvement compared to similar conventional operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Novel electric motor, drive, and mechanical system retrofits that are more optimally matched to yield overall
improved system energy efficiency, reliability, and productivity improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Demonstration of exemplary electric motor and drive system management policies and maintenance practices that
result in higher process reliability and gradual, but continual, overall energy efficiency improvement. Topical
areas of interest could be motor repair and rewind techniques, electrical distribution improvement, and mechanical
system maintenance and optimization.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Demonstrations that identify and implement the solution to power quality problems, and by doing so, effectively
increases total system efficiency and productivity. Specifically, projects addressing the impact of power quality
on motor drives and other motor system components which quantify the true cost/benefits of power quality enhancement
with respect to total motor system efficiency, reliability and productivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Implementation and retrofit of efficient motor and drive systems on industrial heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning (HVAC) equipment or motor-driven industrial process heating or cooling systems. These systems should
be integrated creatively and cost-effectively within an entire, or a portion of, an industrial facility or process
to yield improved energy efficiency, reduced life-cycle cost in an environmentally-acceptable manner. [HVAC for
industrial or manufacturing facilities are only of interest, not HVAC for space conditioning of an office or commercial
facility]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects could involve a single unit of equipment, a unit operation, a series of replicable equipment, an entire process,
or an entire facility. In general, proposals are desired which could lead to demonstrably higher U.S. industrial
productivity, energy efficiency, environmental enhancement, and improved competitiveness once the application
is replicated on a widespread basis throughout the United States. This listing is meant to be illustrative, not exclusive.

Final Proposal Technical Evaluation Criteria and Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final proposers will be encouraged to develop a fuller, engineered/technical proposal. The final proposals
then submitted will reflect more detailed engineering, energy, environmental, and economic assessment. While
there is no set format for the final proposals as yet, emphasis will be upon: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The technical soundness and concise explanation of the proposal and its benefits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A clear commitment from the proposing team to provide resources for the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The techniques and methodologies envisioned to measure and validate the demonstration's performance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The quality of the management plan to reach and achieve the stated goals of the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The potential impact of the project to reduce market barriers and accelerate the deployment of efficient electric
motor systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommendations of the technical merit review will be provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Experts
Review Panel to representatives of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Industrial Technologies. Final selection
will be made by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The GCP Act was enacted to protect environmental resources in Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon National
Recreation Area below Glen Canyon Dam. Operation of Glen Canyon Dam has been modified on an interim basis pending completion
of the Glen Canyon Dam environmental impact statement to assure the protection of these resources. Identifying feasible
replacement power resources will require assessment by Western of the magnitude and timing of the power lost at Glen
Canyon Dam and the cost for replacing it. Western's customers will then decide if they desire Western to replace any
or all of the lost Glen Canyon Dam resource. Such acquisitions might be made by Western on behalf of firm power customers
on a pass-through cost basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western will use an integrated resource planning approach to acquire long-term replacement resources at the lowest
possible cost. Western will consider a variety of resource options, both supply-side and demand-side, as well as
renewable resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Replacement Resource Methods Report to Congress detailing Western's findings is to be completed no later than 2
years after implementation of long-term operational criteria at Glen Canyon Dam. Notices of dates and locations
of future consultation opportunities will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is given by Western Area Power Administration (Western) for termination of the public process for the proposed
Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 for the Boulder Canyon Project (BCP) second annual rate adjustment. The termination of
the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 leaves the existing WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;1 BCP power
rate in effect until Western initiates a new annual rate filing in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The public process for the proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 began with a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice published on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28075), announcing the second annual BCP proposed power rate adjustment. Western
held a public information forum on June 15, 1994, and a public comment forum on July 8, 1994. At the request of the BCP
contractors, Western re-evaluated the annual costs in the power repayment spreadsheet study for the ratesetting
methodology period. As a result of this re-evaluation, Western made the decision to terminate the public process
for the proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for Western's decision to terminate the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 is as
follows: (1) The BCP currently has a rate in effect that will satisfy fiscal year (FY) 1994 and FY 1995 annual costs;
and (2) Western believes it is in the final stage of negotiations with the BCP contractors and the Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) concerning an Implementation Agreement, which would provide for a revised methodology for establishing
BCP power rates on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the existing ratesetting methodology, which is the methodology used in the proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2,
the power rate is determined by the higher of (1) the 5-year-average rate for the cost evaluation period or (2) the rate
in the first year of the cost evaluation period. The proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 was set by the 5-year-average
rate, which was the higher of these two determinants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Western implements a BCP rate based on the 5-year-average rate, a revenue surplus at year-end is created. The
revenue surplus would disappear under the revised methodology contained in the Implementation Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western's decision to terminate the public process for the proposed Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 is consistent with
the Stipulation Agreement which provides that (1) Western will undertake the appropriate filing(s) before the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to maintain the BCP rates at the FY 1994 (WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;1) level until September
30, 1995; (2) Reclamation and the BCP contractors agree that neither Reclamation nor any of the BCP contractors will
protest the referenced filing by Western, and this Stipulation may be affixed to said filing as evidence of that agreement;
(3) Western will withdraw the proposed WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2 in accordance with 10 CFR 903.21(a)(1) and will proceed
with the filing(s) as referenced above. Such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to any party with respect to the
issues involved in the rate order and the parties will continue their efforts to resolve those issues; and (4) the parties
will use their best efforts to finalize the negotiations of the Implementation Agreement by October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western has consulted informally with FERC staff and is terminating the public process for Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;2
with this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Western will initiate another public process for the next annual rate in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FERC approved the Rate Order No. WAPA&hyph;58 formula rate on November 3, 1993. The ratesetting methodology approval
period is through September 30, 1997. See FERC's decision at 65 FERC Par 61,186. The Administrator of Western confirmed
and approved Rate WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;1. The existing WAPA&hyph;58&hyph;1 BCP composite power rate identified
in Rate Schedule BCP&hyph;F4/2 is 12.62 mills per kilowatthour (mills/kWh) comprised of an energy charge of 6.31
mills/kWh and a capacity charge of $1.07 per kilowatt per month.

The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. California filed such a petition and subsequently filed
revisions to that petition. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in partial response to a request filed
by the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California and allows additional
time to comment on the revised petition. This extension will provide interested parties enough time to complete their
review and submit meaningful replies and additional comments on the issues we raised in this proceeding.

2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate
and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory
authority by fling a properly supported petition with the FCC.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a
stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to
decide any reconsideration. California filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.

3. Petitioners' motion is dated the date comments were due. They stated that they had already received two lengthy
pleadings and expected a substantial number of additional comments.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In fact, over 1,400 pages of comments and associated pleadings were filed on the California petition. By the time copies
of the pleadings have been obtained, California states that it will have only six or seven business days in which to
review and analyze the record, finalize its comments, and respond to a party's motion addressing confidentiality
issues raised by the petition. Petitioners state that the issues involved are complex and that the proceeding concerns
fundamental state interests. They claim that no party will be prejudiced, and the FCC's ability to meet the one-year
statutory deadline not detrimentally affected, by the requested extension. They believe that the FCC will be well
served by a complete record and careful analysis on the part of California. Petitioners allege that they have shown
good cause for the requested extension.

4. Although it does not object to ``some appropriately brief'' extension, Air Touch Communications argues that the
45-day extension requested by California is excessive and needlessly delays resolution of this proceeding. It states
that rate regulation costs California consumers $250 million per year, contrary to California's claim that no party
will be prejudiced. It states that the pleading cycle in this proceeding was crafted to balance the rights of all parties,
especially the public's right to be relieved of needless regulation.

5. We agree with California that some measure of relief is required. The record in this proceeding is voluminous, and
the issues, including the state of competition and reasonableness of cellular rates in the state, are intricate.
Moreover, California field revisions to its petition on September 13, 1994, which, at our request, included previously
redacted information subsequently determined to be a matter of public record.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Interested parties may wish to comment on any new material. For these reasons, we conclude that an extension of time
would serve the public interest. On the other hand, the Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in
a complex and massive proceeding. Granting an extension as long as California requests could impair the Commission's
ability to comply with the statutory deadlines. For these reasons, we find that good cause has been shown for a extension
of 15 days. This doubles the reply period permitted to a total of 30 days. We also put all parties on notice that those
who wish to address the revised portions of California's petition should do so in these replies.

1. Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel,
Connecticut Telephone and Communication Systems, Inc. and Connecticut Mobilecom, Inc. (collectively Movants)
have filed a motion for a 15-day extension of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For the reasons given below, we grant the motion.

2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate
and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory
authority by filing a properly supported petition with the FCC.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a
stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to
decide any reconsideration. New York filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and
entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the
authority to continue regulating intrastate rates. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in this proceeding
in partial response to a request filed by the New York Public Service Commission. This extension will provide interested
parties enough time to complete their review and submit meaningful replies on the issues we raised in this proceeding.

1. Petitioner New York Public Service Commission (New York) has filed a motion for a 30-day extension of time from the
October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For the reasons given below, we grant New York some, but not all, of the relief requested.

3. New York states that it needs the requested extension in order to have as much time to respond to the opposition as
other parties were given to respond to its petition. It states that it needs the additional time in order to read and
respond to the voluminous and complex comments filed. It observes that very few of the parties served New York with
their pleadings and that it did not receive a full set until September 22. It states that an extension will not undermine
the Commission's ability to complete the proceeding on a timely basis. New York claims that the complexity of the issues
and the fundamental state interests at stake demonstrate that good cause exists for an extension.

4. We agree with New York that some measure of relief is required. The record in this proceeding is large, and the issues,
including the state of competition and reasonableness of cellular rates in the state, are intricate. For these reasons,
we conclude that an extension of time would serve the public interest. On the other hand, the Commission is faced with
stringent statutory deadlines in a large, complex proceeding. Granting an extension as long as New York requests
could impair the Commission's ability to comply with the statutory deadlines. For these reasons, we find that good
cause has been shown for an extension of 15 days. This doubles the reply period permitted to a total of 30 days.

Union Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina; NationsBank Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina; Southern
National Corporation, Lumberton, North Carolina; and Wachovia Corporation, Winston-Salem, North Carolina (collectively,
Applicants), have applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC
Act) and  225.23(a) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)) to expand the data processing services provided
by Southeast Switch, Inc., Maitland, Florida (Company), which operates the Honor electronic funds transfer (EFT)
network pursuant to section 225.25(b)(7) of the Board's Regulation Y. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants currently engage through Company and its subsidiary, Specialty Network Services, Inc., Maitland, Florida,
in card production and related services to entities that are members of the Honor EFT network. Applicants now propose
to provide card production and related services to entities that are not members of the Honor EFT network. The proposed
card production services would include ordering magnetically striped and integrated circuit plastic cards (including
plastic cards sometimes referred to as stored value cards) from card manufacturers, embossing the cards with the
name and account numbers of cardholders, encoding information on the cards' magnetic strips, hot stamping cards,
and generating and assigning personal identification numbers. Applicants propose to engage in this activity throughout
the United States.

Closely Related to Banking Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board after due notice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto....'' In determining whether
a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the matters set forth in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Courier Association v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services
as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require
their provision in a specialized form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 516 F.2d at 1237. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close
relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks.

Applicants maintain that the proposed activities are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act.
Specifically, Applicants maintain that the Board has previously authorized bank holding companies to provide data
processing services to nonfinancial customers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

See, e.g., Citicorp

that are the subject of this application are banking, economic, or financial data that permit the cardholder to initiate
or consummate a banking or financial transaction, and that the identity of the customer does not change the financial
nature of the information being encoded and processed.

In order to approve the proposal, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants believe that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Applicants maintain that the proposal will enhance customer convenience and efficiency. In addition,
Applicants state that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of
resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application,
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the
BHC Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than November 1, 1994. Any request for

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In November of 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance
and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy
by empowering HUD's employees to more effectively serve these customers. In implementing these objectives, the
Secretary determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational
levels full authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program
officials at Headquarters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279), the Department published a Notice revoking and redelegating program authority to
meet the objectives of the reorganization for the Office of Public and Indian Housing. The Notice redelegated to Directors
and Deputy Directors of Public Housing in HUD field offices and to Administrators of Field Offices of Native American
Programs all powers and authorities necessary to carry out Office of Public and Indian Housing Programs within their
jurisdictions. This document supersedes the April 15th redelegation, and provides further guidance to field staff
concerning their specific functions and responsibilities under the programs for which all powers and authorities
are hereby redelegated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing supersedes the prior redelegation and redelegates
authority as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section A. Authority Superseded
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The redelegation of authority contained within the revocation and redelegation of authority (FR&hyph;3696), published
on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18279), is hereby superseded by and replaced with this redelegation of authority; the redelegation
contained within the January 11, 1994 memorandum entitled ``Redelegation of Regional Approval Authorities'' from
the Assistant Secretary for PIH to the field offices is also hereby superseded by and replaced with this redelegation
of authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Land Management announces the availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for
Western Energy Company's Federal Coal Lease Application MTM 80697 and requests public comment on the fair market
value (FMV) and maximum economic recovery (MER) of certain coal resources it proposes to offer for competitive lease
sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The land included in Coal Lease Application MTM 80697 is located in Rosebud County, Montana, and is described as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rosebud seam, averaging 22.3 feet thick, is the only economically minable coal seam within the tract. The tract
contains an estimated 35.6 million tons of recoverable reserves. Coal quality, as received, averages 8,360 BTU/lb,
25.52 percent moisture, 10.03 percent ash and 0.97 percent sulfur. This coal bed is being mined in adjoining tracts
by Western Energy Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS addresses the cultural, socioeconomic and environmental impacts that would likely result from leasing
these federal coal lands, the cumulative impacts of the coal lease application, and the irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of resources involved with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three alternatives are addressed in the FEIS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 1_(Preferred)_Lease the 2,061.00 acres of federal coal lands to Western Energy Company as applied for
in the coal lease application with two additional mitigation measures: (1) Establish a 160-foot buffer zone to protect
cultural properties; and (2) Plant trees in the buffer zone to screen the traditional cultural properties from intrusions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 2_(No Action)_Reject or deny the coal lease application. The federal coal lands would not be offered
for lease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 3_(Cultural Resource Avoidance)_The coal lease application would be partially approved. Two cultural
properties with values as traditional cultural properties and sites with intangible spiritual attributes would
be avoided by excluding federal coal lands in and around these two sites from the coal lease application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public is invited to submit written comments on the FEIS, the FMV and MER of the tract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, notice is also given that a public hearing will be held on Wednesday, November 2, 1994, on the proposed
lease sale, the FMV and MER of the proposed lease tract.

 In accordance with Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), and 42 U.S.C. 4321, the
Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the BLM, Las Cruces District, will be directing
the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third-party contractor on the impacts of the proposed 345kV transmission
line project, the Newman to Port-of-Entry project. The proposed project could affect public and private lands in
El Paso County in western Texas, and Do&ntilde;a Ana County in southwestern New Mexico. BLM's scoping process for
the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable alternatives; and
(3) Notifying interested groups, individuals and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues
can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS process; letters
of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies the proposed
action, alternatives and significant issues being considered to be distributed to selected parties and available

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The El Paso Electric Company is proposing to build approximately 45 miles of 345kV transmission line from the Newman
Power Plant in western Texas, north of El Paso, to the planned Port-of-Entry Substation in southwestern New Mexico
in Santa Teresa, approximately 4 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regional environmental study was conducted in 1992. As a result of this study, approximately 100 miles of alternative
corridors were identified as being environmentally and technically satisfactory for transmission line development.
Potential issues include, but may not be limited to, residential and agricultural impacts, sensitive wildlife and
plant species, historical or traditional cultural properties, visual impacts, and electric and magnetic effects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lands crossed by the alternative study corridors include those under the jurisdiction of the BLM, Fort Bliss Military
Reservation, State of New Mexico, and the counties of El Paso (Texas) and Do&ntilde;a Ana (New Mexico). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of El Paso Electric's 10-year plan, the proposed project is intended to improve the reliability of the electrical
system. Construction of the proposed transmission line is anticipated to begin in January 1998 and be in operation
by June 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of the EIS and related activities will be to study and assess the potential impacts of the proposed project
to various environmental resources including biological (e.g., threatened or endangered species), cultural,
land use, visual, socioeconomic, geology, soils, and surface water. Alternatives that will be considered in the
EIS include routing/siting locations, no action, and others that are identified through the scoping process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the project study area includes the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, the BLM has invited the Department of
Defense (Fort Bliss) to be a cooperating agency. A memorandum of agreement is anticipated between El Paso Electric,
BLM, and Department of the Army (Fort Bliss). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the EIS process will take 18 months and will include public information/scoping meetings;
coordination and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies; public review and public hearings on the published
draft EIS; a published final EIS and a review period; and publication of a record of decision (ROD). Public information
and scoping meetings will begin in October 1994. Publication of the ROD is anticipated in April 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 12, 1990, Public Land Order No. 6763 withdrew public lands and public minerals from operation of the public
land laws, including the mining laws, for five years to protect Sea Site I, a highly classified, sensitive, electronic
warfare installation at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, pending the processing of an Engle Act
withdrawal application. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing. This withdrawal exceeds the 5,000
acre limitation and requires legislation under the Engle Act. This legislation has not yet been approved and the segregation
provided by the five year withdrawal will terminate on January 11, 1995. It is proposed that Public Land Order No. 6763
be extended for five years to continue the segregation provided by this withdrawal.

Until January 5, 1995, all persons who wish to submit comments, suggestions, or objections in connection with the
proposed extension may present their views in writing to the California State Director of the Bureau of Land Management.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that an opportunity for a public meeting is accorded in connection with the proposed extension.
Public meetings were held in Ridgecrest, California on February 6 and 16, 1984, and in Lancaster, California on November
15 and 16, 1984 concerning the Navy's application to withdraw Sea Site I. There have been no substantive changes in
either the proposed use of the withdrawn area or the issues involved since these meetings were held. Any parties who
feel that a public meeting would provide important information and should be held, must submit their request and reasons
therefore to the California State Director by January 5, 1995. If the authorized officer determines that a public
meeting will be held, a notice of the time and place will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least 30 days prior to the scheduled date of the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed extension will be processed in accordance with the regulations set forth in 43 CFR part 2310. The proposed
extension of this withdrawal will not authorize any military use of the lands by the Department of the Navy until legislation
under the Engle Act is enacted by Congress.

Else M. Hillgard, M.D.; Denial of Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Else M. Hillgard, M.D., of Arlington, Virginia, proposing to deny her application
for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Hillgard's registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Hillgard on August 13, 1993. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Dr. Hillgard. The Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from Dr.
Hillgard or anyone purporting to represent her. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that
Dr. Hillgard has waived her opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and
1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative
file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, a DEA investigation revealed that Dr. Hillgard prescribed controlled substances to several individuals
that were admitted drug abusers. When Dr. Hillgard became aware that she was under investigation for excessive prescribing,
she voluntarily surrendered her DEA Certificate of Registration, AH8248153 on July 25, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 22, 1990, Dr. Hillgard signed a Memorandum of Agreement with DEA in which she was granted a Certificate of Registration
to handle only Schedule II non-narcotic and Schedule IV controlled substances, subject to certain terms and conditions.
On September 4, 1990, DEA issued Dr. Hillgard DEA Certificate of Registration, BH2412687.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In September 1990, the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received information that Dr. Hillgard
was again excessively prescribing controlled substances to known drug abusers for no legitimate medical reason.
As a result, on October 23, 1991, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine was suspended by the Maryland Board of
Physician Quality Assurance (Board). On October 24, 1991, Dr. Hillgard voluntarily surrendered her DEA Certificate
of Registration, BH2412687.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 15, 1992, the Board revoked Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine. The Board found that Dr. Hillgard
was selling, prescribing, giving away or administering drugs for illegal or illegitimate purposes. Based in part
upon the Board's findings regarding Dr. Hillgard's prescribing practices, and subsequent decision to revoke her
medical license, effective February 28, 1994, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of
Virginia was also revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that as of September 15, 1992, Dr. Hillgard's license to practice medicine in the State
of Maryland was revoked, and effective February 28, 1994, her license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of
Virginia was also revoked. As a result, she is unable to handle controlled substances in the state in which she is registered
with DEA. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who
is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21),
823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992);
Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Hillgard's application for DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied.
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration,
executed by Else M. Hillgard, M.D., be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective October 7, 1994.

In accordance with Section 250(a), Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 USC 2273),
the Department of Labor issued a Certification for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance on August 29, 1994,
applicable to all workers of the Alaska Pulp Corporation, Rowan Bay Logging in Sitka, Alaska and the Sitka Pulp Mill
in Sitka, Alaska. The notice will soon be published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings
show that the Wrangell Sawmill Division is owned by the Alaska Pulp Corporation and a substantial portion of its production
is integrated with the Sitka Pulp mill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include the Wrangell Sawmill Division in Wrangell,
Alaska.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to NAFTA_00185 is hereby issued as follows:

In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on January 27, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the State Agency, the Department again reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New findings show that the Wrangell Sawmill Division is owned by the Alaska Pulp Corporation and a substantial portion
of the production at Wrangell consisted of wood chips which are integrated into the production of wood pulp at the Alaska
Pulp Corporation In Sitka, Alaska.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1994, the Department, at the request of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (ACTWU)
reopened its investigation for the former workers of the subject facility. The initial investigation resulted in
a negative determination on May 24, 1994. The negative determination was published in the

The investigation revealed that the Distribution Center in Kenosha serviced the Jockey sewing plant in Kenosha and
was a substantial part of the company's integrated production process. Workers at Jockey's sewing plant in Kenosha
were certified for TAA on July 30, 1993 under petition, TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,835.

Workers at the Distribution Center experienced employment declines as a result of the production declines at Jockey's
sewing plant in Kenosha. The Distribution Center closed in May, 1994. Accordingly, the Department is revising its
negative determination for workers at Jockey's Distribution Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with underwear produced at Jockey International, Inc., Kenosha, Wisconsin contributed
importantly to the employment declines of workers at the Kenosha, Wisconsin Distribution Center of Jockey International,
Incorporated. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following certification:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specific therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for the delay in the effective date as prescribed in
that section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and
in large volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0172 columnbreak -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Room S&hyph;3014, Washington, D.C. 20210.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of
the exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains a final exemption from certain prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). The class exemption applies to
certain prospective transactions involving employee benefit plans where such transactions are specifically authorized
by the Department pursuant to a settlement agreement. The exemption affects plans, participants and beneficiaries
of such plans, and certain individuals engaging in such transactions or activities.

 On May 27, 1994, the Department of Labor (the Department) published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 27581) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through
(D), 406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code,
by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department proposed the class exemption on its own motion pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).

Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) generally transferred the authority
of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue administrative exemptions under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code to the Secretary
of Labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit written comments or requests for a hearing on the proposed
exemption to the Department. No public comments and no requests for a public hearing with respect to the proposed class
exemption were received by the Department. Upon consideration of the record as a whole, the Department has determined
to grant the class exemption as proposed.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from
certain other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption
does not expressly apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of ERISA. Section 404
requires, in part, that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. This exemption
does not affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that a plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the
employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The exemption will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b)(3) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(1)(F)
of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and based upon the entire record,
the Department finds that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of their participants
and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of such plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including statutory
or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative
or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The exemption is applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the class exemption are satisfied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the following exemption is granted under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective as of October 7, 1994, the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2)
of ERISA and the taxes imposed by sections 4975(a) and 4975(b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to a transaction or activity which is authorized, prior to the occurrence of such transaction
or activity, by a settlement agreement resulting from an investigation of an employee benefit plan conducted by the
Department under the authority of section 504(a) of ERISA, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The nature of such transaction or activity is specifically described in writing, by the terms of such settlement
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Department of Labor is a party to the settlement agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A party who will be engaging in the transaction or activity has provided written notice to the affected participants
and beneficiaries in a manner that is reasonably calculated to result in the receipt of such notice at least 30 days
prior to entry into the settlement agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A copy of the notice and the method of distribution is approved in advance by the area or district office of the Department
which negotiated the settlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The notice includes an objective description of the transaction or activity, the approximate date on which the
transaction will occur, the address of the area or district office of the Department which negotiated the settlement
agreement, and a statement apprising participants and beneficiaries of their right to forward their comments to
such office.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures to be followed with respect to meetings conducted pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) are described in this notice.
These procedures are set forth in order that they may be incorporated by reference in future individual meeting notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACNW advises the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on nuclear waste disposal facilities. This includes facilities
covered under 10 CFR parts 60 and 61 and other applicable regulations and legislative mandates such as the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, and the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act,
as amended. The Committee's reports become a part of the public record. The ACNW meetings are normally open to the public
and provide opportunities for oral or written statements from members of the public to be considered as part of the
Committee's information gathering procedure. The meetings are not adjudicatory hearings such as those conducted
by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as part of the Commission's licensing process. ACNW full Committee
meetings are conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for each full Committee meeting. Practical considerations may dictate some changes to the agenda. The Chairman of
the Committee is empowered to conduct the meeting in a manner that, in his judgment, will facilitate the orderly conduct
of business, including making provisions to continue discussions of matters not completed on the scheduled day to
the next day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following requirements shall apply to public participation in ACNW meetings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Persons desiring to make oral statements at the meeting should make a request to do so to the Designated Federal
Official prior to the beginning of the meeting and summarize the content of the oral statements for the Designated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Further information regarding topics to be discussed, whether a meeting has been cancelled or rescheduled, and
the Chairman's ruling on requests for the opportunity to present oral statements and the time allotted therefor can
be obtained by contacting, on the working day prior to the meeting, the Office of the Executive Director of the ACNW

interfere with the conduct of the meeting. Approval from the Designated Federal Official will have to be obtained
prior to the installation or use of such equipment. The use of such equipment will be allowed while the meeting is in
session at the discretion of the Chairman to a degree that it is not disruptive. When use of such equipment is permitted,
appropriate measures will be taken to protect proprietary or privileged information that may be in documents, folders,
etc., being used during the meeting. Electronic recordings will be permitted only during those portions of the meeting

being discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Designated Federal Official should be informed of such an agreement at least five working days prior to the meeting
so that it can be confirmed, and a determination can be made regarding the applicability of the agreement to the material
that will be discussed during the meeting. The minimum information provided should include information regarding
the date of the agreement, the scope of material included in the agreement, the project or projects involved, and the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to amend: (1) Section 107A of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide'') to allow the Exchange greater latitude
in evaluating the listing eligibility of those securities which cannot be readily categorized under the Exchange's
existing listing criteria; and (2) Section 107B of the Guide to provide for greater flexibility in the listing criteria
for Equity-Linked Term Notes (``ELNs''). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary,
Amex, and at the Commission.

In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In March 1990, the Commission approved the adoption of Section 107A of the Guide, which provides listing criteria
for hybrid securities, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 securities that have features common to both debt and equity securities, yet do not fit within the traditional definitions
of such securities.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In May 1993, the Commission approved the adoption of Section 107B of the Guide to specifically permit the listing of
ELNs.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 An ELN is an intermediate-term, hybrid instrument whose value at maturity is linked to the performance of a highly
capitalized, actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR.

Section 107A of the Guide currently specifies minimum issuer qualifications, public distribution, aggregate market
value guidelines, and other criteria to assist the Exchange in its case-by-case review and determination of the suitability
of any hybrid security (including ELNs) for listing and trading. The Exchange now proposes to amend Section 107A of
the Guide to provide additional flexibility in the listing of such securities. Specifically, it is proposed that
the aggregate minimum market value criteria be changed from $20 million to $4 million, consistent with the current
listing requirements for currency and index warrants under Section 106 of the Guide. The Exchange also proposes to
eliminate, in favor of a case-by-case review, the minimum holder requirement for securities that are listed pursuant
to Section 107A of the Guide but which are traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond trading floor.

The Exchange believes that these revision will provide the Exchange with the flexibility necessary to evaluate the
suitability of such securities for listing. The Exchange states that hybrid securities have special appeal for various
investors, especially institutions. The Exchange also believes that securities admitted to listing under Section
107A of the Guide benefit investors by providing important investment, hedging, and market timing opportunities,
as well as benefiting those issuers that offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital at an advantageous cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Section 107B, the Exchange proposes a number of changes which it believes will provide for greater
flexibility in the listing criteria for ELNs and the criteria for the underlying linked stock. Specifically, the
Exchange proposes to: (1) amend the definition of an ELN to encompass instruments which are linked, in whole or in part,
to the market performance of a non-convertible preferred stock; (2) amend Section 107B(d) to provide an additional
minimum market capitalization and trading volume tier for the underlying security of $500 million in market capitalization
and 80 million shares traded in the 12-months prior to the date of listing;&sect;
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 (3) amend Section 107B(d) to provide the Exchange with flexibility, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the
Commission, to list an ELN linked to a security that does not meet the specific market capitalization and volume criteria;
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and (4) amend Section 107B(f) to provide for the issuance of ELNs, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission,
that relate to more than the allowable maximum percentages of outstanding shares of the underlying security.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the Exchange proposes to clarify that issuers of ELNs have the option of specifying at the time of issuance
that the issuer may satisfy their obligations at maturity of the ELN either with cash or by physical delivery of the
underlying linked stock. The Exchange shall require any issuer that reserves the right to make physical delivery
of the underlying stock at maturity, to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity
of the ELN, of how the issuer intends to satisfy its obligations.

Currently, the underlying linked security must either have: (i) a minimum market capitalization of $3 billion and

Depending on the proposed facts, the Commission may require the Exchange to submit a rule filing to the Commission
pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act to address the regulatory issues raised by any proposed offering of ELNs that does
not satisfy the market capitalization and/or trading volume requirements of Section 107B of the Guide. In this connection,
the Commission notes that any proposal to list an ELN linked to a security with a market capitalization of less than
$500 million would raise significant regulatory concerns for which a Section 19(b) rule filing would be required.

The Exchange believes these revisions strike an appropriate balance between the Exchange's responsiveness to innovation
in the securities markets and its need to ensure the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets. Moreover, the Exchange believes that these changes will not have an adverse impact on the markets for the
underlying linked security in view of the requirements that the linked security must have a large minimum market capitalization
and a large trading volume over the preceding 12 months. Under the listing standards for ELNs, without approval from
the staff of the Commission, an ELN issuer will only be able to issue an ELN linked to a maximum of 5% of the outstanding
shares of the underlying security. The Exchange believes, therefore, that the issuer should be able to satisfy all,
or substantially all, of its obligations at maturity by physical delivery of the linked security. Under these circumstances,
the Exchange believes there would be no need or incentive on the part of the ELN issuer to enter the market for the linked
security to any significant degree in order to discharge its obligations to ELN holders at the time of maturity. Additionally,
all of the other requirements for the listing of ELNs currently in place will continue to apply to the listing of ELNs.

The Amex has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and

6(b)(5) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, regarding the proposed amendments to Section
107A of the Guide, the Commission believes that the proposal will provide the Amex with added flexibility to list and
trade hybrid securities, which may benefit investors by providing additional investment and hedging opportunities,
as well as benefitting issuers who offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital. Additionally, the proposed
changes to Section 107A of the Guide will conform Amex's rules regarding the listing of hybrid securities to those
already approved for the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The NYSE's hybrid listing rules do not contain
a minimum holder requirement for hybrid issues traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond floor.
Additionally, Section 703.19 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual provides that an issue of a hybrid security must
have a minimum market value at issuance of $4 million.

With respect to the remaining amendments to Section 107B, the Commission believes that the proposed changes do not
raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Commission's prior approval orders regarding
ELNs.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement
for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to ELNs while maintaining the
requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR issued by a highly capitalized
issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELN eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization
requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked
to an ELN issue if its trading volume in the U.S. for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is
four times higher than the current minimum trading volume requirement.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to
ensure that ELNs are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements
will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELNs.

Finally, the Commission notes that the prior approval orders regarding ELNs
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 did not contain a prohibition against an issuer retaining the ability to satisfy its obligations at maturity of the
ELN either in cash or with shares of the underlying security. Without Commission approval, a particular issuance
of ELNs may not be linked to more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the underlying security. In these cases, because
of the large market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the underlying security, the Commission
believes that the ELN will have minimal impact on the market for the underlying security even if the issuer determines
to satisfy its obligations with shares and must purchase the necessary shares prior to maturity. We note that if the
Commission were to approve an ELN related to more than the maximum allowable percentages specified in Section 107B,
the Commission would be able to impose restrictions and limitations, on a case-by-case basis, to minimize the potential
of the ELN having an adverse impact on the market for the underlying security. The Commission also believes that it
is appropriate for issuers to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity of the
ELN, about the issuer's intention to satisfy its obligations to the holders of the ELNs with either cash or shares of
the underlying security.

companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act, the Amex represented to the Commission that no problems

Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2) under the Act, 17 CFR 240.19d&hyph;1(c)(2), authorizes national securities exchanges to
adopt minor rule violation plans for the summary discipline and abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations by
exchange members and member organizations. The BSE's Plan was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438 (April 24, 1989).

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34309 (July 5, 1994), 59
FR 35548 (July 12, 1994). no comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BSE's Plan, as embodied in Chapter XVIII, Section 4 of the BSE's Rules, provides that the Exchange may impose a fine,
not to exceed $2500, on any member, member organization, or person associated with a member or member organization
for any violation of an Exchange rule that has been deemed to be minor in nature and approved by the Commission for inclusion
in the Plan. The rule change will add to the List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable thereto Pursuant
to Section 4 of Chapter XVIII for the imposition of fines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Failure to Promptly Respond to Exchange Blue Sheet Requests or File Regularly Scheduled Financial (FOCUS, SIPC)
and/or Regulatory Reports (Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire, Quarterly Option Report);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Improper Use of the ITS Administrative Message Function; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Failure to Register Floor Employees and Complete Appropriate Forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, and with the Section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules
of an exchange provide that its members are appropriately disciplined for violations of an exchange's rules and the
Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the Commission believes that an exchange's ability to effectively enforce compliance by its members
and member organization with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. The inclusion
of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan, therefore, should not be interpreted to mean that it is not an important
rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that the inclusion of minor violations of particular rules under
a minor rule violation plan may make the exchange's disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting more egregious
and/or repeated violations of these rules, thereby furthering its mandates to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that adding the provisions listed above to the Chapter XVIII of the Exchange's Rules and to
the Exchange's Plan is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6) in that the purpose of chapter XVIII is to provide
for a response to a violation of Exchange Rules or policy when a meaningful sanction is needed, but when initiation
of a disciplinary proceeding under the Chapter XXX is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and
time-consuming than would be warranted given the nature of the violation. Chapter XVIII provides for an appropriate
response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused
through specified, required procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Plan permits any person to contest the Exchange's imposition of the fine through submission of a written answer,
at which time the matter will become a disciplinary proceeding subject to Chapter XXX of the BSE's Rules and, where
applicable, the reporting provisions of Commission Rule 19d&hyph;1. Furthermore, the Exchange retains the option
of bringing violations of rules included in the Plan to full disciplinary proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the Commission finds that violations of the provisions being added are objective and technical in nature,
and are easily verifiable, thereby lending themselves to the use of expedited proceedings. Noncompliance with the
provisions may be determined objectively and adjudicated quickly without the complicated factual and interpretive
inquiries associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary proceedings. If the Exchange determines that
a violation of one of these rules is not minor in nature, the Exchange retains the discretion to initiate full disciplinary
proceedings in accordance with Chapter XXX of the BSE Rules. The Commission expects the BSE to bring full disciplinary
proceedings in appropriate cases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in cases where the violation is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;08) is approved.

I. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of CBOE's proposed rule change is twofold: first, to clarify Rule 6.42 and add a new Interpretation and
Policy, .02 to permit quotes for combined trades and stock-option orders, as defined by CBOE Rule 1.1(ii) (``stock-option
orders'') to be expressed in any fractional or decimal price;
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and, second, to alter the priority principles applicable to combined trades and stock-option combination orders,
as defined by CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(b) (``stock-option combinations''), when priced net at a multiple of one sixteenth
of a dollar.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE believes that these changes will facilitate the orderly execution of combined trades and stock-option orders.

 Amendment No. 2. Under Rule 1.1(ii)(b), a stock-option combination order is an order to buy or sell a stated number
of units of an underlying or a related security coupled with the purchase and sale of an equal number of put and call option
contracts, each having the same exercise price, expiration date and number of units of the underlying or related security,
on the opposite side of the market representing in aggregate twice the number of units of the underlying or related
security.

Rule 6.42 currently permits a CBOE member holding an order on a combined trade or stock-option combination to attain
priority over bids and offers in the trading crowd (``crowd'') and the customer limit order book (``limit order book''
or ``book'') provided all legs of the combined trade or stock-option combination trade at a price that is at least equivalent
to quotes in the crowd or on the book. As revised, combined trades and stock-option combinations priced net at a multiple
of 1/16 will attain priority over orders in the book only if one leg of the transaction trades at a price that is better
than the corresponding bid or offer in the book while the remaining legs of the transaction are at least equivalent
to the established bids or offers in the crowd or book. The principles for attaining priority over the crowd remain
unchanged. Bids or offers that are part of a combined trade or stock-option combination which is not priced at a net
multiple of 1/16, while permissible, will not be entitled to priority under the exception contained in paragraph
(d) to Rule 6.45. Finally, only the net price of the combination will be quoted in fractional or decimal prices; the
individual legs of the combination must still be quoted in accordance with Rule 6.42.

 Letter from Barbara Casey, Vice President, Department of Market Regulation, CBOE, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative
Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 24, 1994 (``August 24, 1994 Letter''). Rule 6.42 requires bids and offers
for all option series trading above $3 to be expressed in 1/8ths of $1, while bids and offers for all option series trading
below $3 are to be expressed in 1/16ths of $1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an illustration, assume that Option A is quoted at 5 bid, 51/8 asked, and option B is quoted at 6 bid, 61/8 asked, and
assume that all four quotes are represented in the book. In that instance, a spread involving the purchase (or sale)
of option A and the sale (or purchase) of option B may trade at a net credit or debit of 1 (e.g., a net credit of 1 if option
A is bought at 5 and option B sold at 6, or a net debit of 1 if option A is sold at 51/8 and option B is bought at 61/8. In this
example, because the net price is a multiple of 1/16 and the execution of the spread involves taking the same side of
the market as the book on only one side of the spread, the spread would receive priority even though it ``touches'' quotes
in the book on both sides. (That is, in the spread consisting of the purchase of option A at 5 and the sale of option B at
6, only the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
purchase
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of option A occurs at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book, which is bid at 5; the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of option B at 6 is on the opposite side of the market in the book, which is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bid
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 6.) In the same example, it would not be permissible under Rule 6.45(d) to trade the spread at a net debit of 7/8 by selling
the first option at 51/8 and buying the second at 6, because this trade would be executed at the same price and on the same
side of the market as the book on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
both sides
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the spread.

To qualify for priority treatment, combined trades and stock-option combinations must meet the existing requirements
of Rule 6.45(d), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
one member must represent all legs of the transaction, each leg must cover the same number of options, and the trade
must be executed against one other member. In those circumstances, the CBOE believes it is fair to give these transactions
priority when priced net at a multiple of 1/16. Additionally, the CBOE represents that it will continue to disseminate
the individual legs with a prefix to identify trades effected as part of a combined trade or stock-option combination.

regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers.

The first change permits the quoting of combined trades and stock-option orders in either fractional or decimal prices.
Because these trades involve separate transactions effected at a net price, the Commission believes that the ability
to quote net prices in either fractional or decimal prices will provide the CBOE with greater flexibility to permit
market participants to price these orders more precisely, which should result in greater efficiency and improved
liquidity in their execution, and better prices for investors. The Commission notes that the individual legs of combined
trades and stock-option combinations currently are, and will continue to be, reported separately with an ``S'' in
the prefix field identifying it as part of a combination. Furthermore, the individual legs will continue to be input
to the CBOE price reporting system and made available to vendors in the same manner as all other CBOE trades.

The Commission notes this change will not affect the existing priority rules applicable to these transactions except
that, as discussed below, an exchange member will not be able to better an existing price by an increment less than 1/16th
and still attain priority. Therefore, the Commission is satisfied this change will not disadvantage existing orders
on the book.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that combined trades and stock-option combinations must be priced net at a multiple of 1/16th
in order to qualify for priority. These transactions will continue to take priority over orders in the crowd when all
legs of the combination trade at a price that is at least equivalent to quotes in the crowd, in accordance with the current
rule. However, as amended, combined trades and stock-option combinations will only attain priority over the book
when one leg of the transaction trades at a price that is better than the corresponding bid or offer in the book and the
remaining legs of the transaction trades at a price that is at least equivalent to the established bids or offers in
the crowd or book. The Commission notes that this change affords greater protection to the book since one leg of the
combined trade or stock-option combination must now at least trade at a better price than the book (while all remaining
legs must still at least touch the other bids or offers in the crowd or book) before the book loses priority. In addition,
because the Rule currently requires that one member must represent all legs of the trade and that the trade may only
be executed against one other member, public customers are still less likely to lose priority to combined trades and
stock-option combinations.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the change to Rule 6.42 assures that orders in the book will not lose priority to these transactions unless
the net price is quoted in increments of 1/16th. The Commission believes that the proposal is a reasonable effort by
the CBOE to accommodate the ability to price combined trades and stock-option combinations more competitively while
at the same time not disadvantaging the public customer limit order book. The Commission also notes that the priority
principles applicable to the type of stock-option order as defined by Rule 1.1(ii)(a), remain unchanged, except
to the extent that this type of order must be quoted in increments of 1/16th in order to attain priority over the crowd.

The Commission does not believe that investors with public orders in the limit order book will be disadvantaged by
the granting of priority to combined trades or stock-option combination orders since Rule 6.45(d) provides that
these transactions may only be executed ahead of the book if both parts of the combination order are executed with one
other person at a net debit or credit.

Under Rule 6.45, stock-option orders, as defined by Rule 1.1(ii)(a), consisting of an order to buy or sell a stated
number of units of an underlying or a related security coupled with the purchase or sale of option contract(s) of the
same series on the opposite side of the market representing the same number of units of the underlying or related security,
may only attain priority over the trading crowd and

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Amendment No. 2 amends Interpretation .02 to Rule 6.42 to allow stock-option orders, as defined in Rule 1.1(ii),
to be priced net in any fractional or decimal price, but also states that the priority principles applicable to such
transactions will not apply unless the net price is expressed in increments that are multiples of 1/16. The Commission
notes that a stock-option combination order is a transaction involving a combined trade and the purchase or sale of
the underlying stock. The Commission does not believe it is appropriate to distinguish between combined trades and
stock-option combinations simply because one transaction involves the purchase or sale of the underlying stock.
The same concerns attendant to the pricing of combined trades apply equally to a combination coupled with the purchase
of stock.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has requested a waiver of compliance from certain provisions of the
Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231) (see FR 39820, August 4, 1994). BN states that it is building
one trainset of its ``trough train'' equipment. This train will be composed of 22, 13-section cars. The parking brakes
on these cars are of conventional design, but their location is not standard. The unique size and design of one, 13-section
car does not allow the conventional application of a handbrake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BN is seeking a waiver of compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;231.1(a)1, 231.1(a)(3)(i), and 231.1(a)(3)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 231.1(a)(1) requires that there be one efficient handbrake which shall operate in harmony with the power
brake installed on the car. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has determined that a public hearing be held in this matter. Accordingly
a public hearing is hereby set for 10:00 a.m. on November 15, 1994, at the Nebraska Public Service Commission, 300 The
Atrium, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1200 N Street, Lincoln, Nebraska. The hearing will be an informal one and will be conducted in accordance with Rule
25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the FRA Rules of Practice (49 CFR Part 211.25), by a representative designated by the FRA. The hearing will be a nonadversary
proceeding in which all interested parties will be given the opportunity to express their views regarding this waiver
petition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice contains three proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities for the R&amp;D program. These proposed priorities focus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on accommodations for individuals with disabilities in adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education programs, reproductive issues for women with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities, and HIV/AIDS and disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority for the R&amp;D program of NIDRR is contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 204(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of l973, as amended (29 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 760&hyph;762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to public agencies and private agencies and organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including institutions of higher education, Indian tribes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal organizations. This program is designed to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrete research, demonstration, training, and related projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop methods, procedures, and technology that maximize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full inclusion and integration into society, independent living, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment, family support, and economic and social self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiency of individuals with disabilities, especially those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the most severe disabilities. Under program regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34 CFR 351.32, the Secretary may establish research priorities by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserving funds to support the research activities listed in 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 351.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed priorities support the National Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goals, one of which states that every American will be literate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizenship.

a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final priorities will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other considerations of the Department. Funding of particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects depends on the final priorities, the availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds, and the quality of the applications received. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.

Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absolute preference to applications that meet one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following priorities. The Secretary proposes to fund under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program only applications that meet one of these absolute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Priority 1: Accommodations for Individuals With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disabilities in Adult Education Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In fiscal year 1991 Adult Education (AE) programs funded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Adult Education Act (P.L. 100&hyph;297, as amended) served 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 3.7 million people in Adult Basic Education, Adult Secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education, and English-as-a-Second-Language programs. Adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education programs serve persons who are educationally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantaged, including individuals with all types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities. The Office of Vocational and Adult Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates that at least 30 percent of the persons in AE programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a disability. Adults (aged 16 years or older) with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities are enrolled in AE programs throughout the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and territories in local educational agencies, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colleges, community-based organizations, mental hospitals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation and correctional facilities, and other facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serving individuals with disabilities (U.S. Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education, Adult Learning and Literacy Clearinghouse, Fact Sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9, February 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because they are educationally disadvantaged, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals with disabilities in AE programs may need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodations. These accommodations may involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of auxiliary aids and services (e.g., relaxed time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for tests, interpreters). Published efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify accommodations for adults with disabilities in AE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs have focused on administering tests and diagnostic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments (American Council on Education, ``GED Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accommodations,'' Washington, D.C., 1990; American Council on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education, ``External Diploma Program Assessment Accommodations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Modifications for Adults with Special Learning Needs,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, D.C., 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to testing and assessment accommodations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals with disabilities in AE programs may require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodations related to the presentation of instructional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, alternative formats to print materials, notetakers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives to written assignments, practicums, scheduling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a variety of other educational tasks and requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adult Education administrators and teachers need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand not only their obligations under section 504 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act, as amended, but also the resources that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to enable them to provide the accommodations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, students with disabilities in AE programs need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand their rights, articulate their needs, and identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodations that will assist them to meet the program's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

Proposed Priority 2: Reproductive Issues for Women With Physical Disabilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the attention given to disability in general and certain impairments in particular, one of the groups within
the disabled population that has received little recognition or study is women. (Doggone, Mary J, Brooks, Nancy A.,
1985). Over 3,000,000 women of childbearing age in the United States have some type of disability. Many women with
physical disabilities have been discouraged by their families, friends, and health providers from considering
the option of parenthood. Until very recently, women with many types of physical disabilities have not been encouraged
or facilitated in exercising that option by health care providers and others. Medical professionals have often discouraged
pregnancy for women with physical disabilities because of the limited understanding of the effect of bodily changes
during pregnancy, labor, and delivery on existing impairments. This priority addresses reproductive issues confronted
specifically by women with physical disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some aspects of women's health maintenance that are an ordinary part of life for most women pose significant problems
for women with physical disabilities. Dependent upon the type of disability, fertility may be unaffected but pregnancy
may be an increased risk and require high-risk management; genetic counseling may be suggested; symptoms of chronic
disease or impairment may or may not be exacerbated; delivery may be difficult; and urinary infections, decubitus
ulcers, and autonomic hyperreflexia during labor and delivery may be present. (Asrael, W., Huberman, B., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NAACOG Update Series
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Vol. 5, Lesson 11, 1986).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Women with physical disabilities often require specialized obstetrical attention for a number of possible concerns.
The interaction of drugs may have a more severe impact on their systems, such as the canceling effect of antiseizure
medications and oral contraceptives, or the multiplying effect of antispasmodics on other drugs with depressive
side effects. There has been little research on the long-term effects of oral contraceptives and other hormonal treatments
for women who lead sedentary existences and who often have compromised circulatory systems. (Nosek, M.,

, Vol. 1, No. 4, 1992). Concerns revolve around the ability to conceive, the special problems and risks if any, during
pregnancy, the impact on the disability itself, and the methods of delivery.

, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1988), looked at six important areas of stress that pregnant women with physical disabilities experience.
Three are role related: accepting the new role of childbearing and the impending responsibilities of parenthood,
accepting extra nurturing and assuming a more dependent role, and dealing with fatigue and limitations on activity
in the perinatal period. Psychosocial issues cannot be separated from the woman's general well-being.

Research supports the conclusion that more extensive education of health care providers and consumers in the medical
and psychosocial aspects of disability and in the area of human sexuality and communications regarding this aspect
of health care could lead to improved health services for women with disabilities. Among the problems in providing
appropriate reproduction-related services to women with disabilities is the limited experience of obstetricians-gynecologists
with health issues of various types of disabilities, and the limited involvement of physiatrists and other specialists
in prenatal care. Physicians who may have been involved in the woman's previous care include a physiatrist, orthopedist,
neurologist and urologist. The proposed project is to investigate appropriate roles for these specialists in the
pregnancy care team.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If women with disabilities are to have options for reproductive care comparable to those available to women without
disabilities, then the obstetrical profession and ancillary health care personnel must be educated on the special
pregnancy-related needs of women with physical disabilities. Development and dissemination of current information
to health care practitioners and to women with disabilities will be a key element of any project to be funded under this
priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Being informed is one of the best ways for a woman to increase her confidence and ensure she is given the same pregnancy-related
options as her nondisabled peers. (Beckmann, Gittler, Barzansky, and Beckmann, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Obstetrics and Gynecology
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Vol. 74, No. 1, July, 1989). A woman with a disability who is pregnant should be aware of major risks, and needs a support
system that includes an obstetrical team sensitive to the specific issues related to her disability. (Freda, Cioschi,
Nilson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physical Disabilities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, AOTA, Vol. 12, No. 2, June 1989.) For this reason, the project to be supported under this priority must address the
pregnancy-related information needs of women with physical disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Choices concerning pregnancy and motherhood often have different implications for women in diverse cultures, depending
upon the psychosocial expectations of women and the support systems available to them. Expectations and support
systems of disabled women from minority backgrounds may be quite different from those available to other women. A
project to be funded under this priority is expected to address the research questions concerning disability, pregnancy,
and cultural competency. Thus, any project must involve not only women with physical disabilities, but also disabled
women from diverse cultural backgrounds, in the design, conduct, and dissemination of the research. A grantee funded
under this priority is expected to demonstrate familiarity and ability to coordinate both research and dissemination
with other projects and agencies addressing related issues, including the Department of Health and Human Services
and its grantees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) causes a chronic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progressive immunologic deficiency disease with a spectrum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manifestations. (Atkins, B.J. and Hancock, A.K., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). The continuum can be seen as four major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stages: Acute HIV Disease; Chronic Asymptomatic HIV Disease; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chronic Symptomatic HIV Disease; and Advanced Disease (AIDS). It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is known that HIV affects every cultural, social, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sexual, racial, and geographic group in this country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated that ``HIV is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to impact every household in America in the 1990s.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of people who have AIDS is significant: the Centers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HIV/AIDS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance Report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1994, noted that, as of December, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
361,509 cases of AIDS had been reported in the United States. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these, 138,223 individuals were known to be living with AIDS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These figures do not include individuals who have been diagnosed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as HIV seropositive, but have not yet developed full-blown AIDS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that number is estimated to exceed one million. Racial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethnic minority populations have been disproportionately affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HIV infection and AIDS. In 1992, 47 percent of all reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AIDS cases were among African-Americans and Hispanics although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these two groups represent only 21 percent of the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population (1992 CDC Newsletter). HIV infections are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing rapidly among women. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although HIV disease is chronic, progressive, and, so far, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately fatal, the average period of time from onset of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infection to death continues to grow longer, due to improved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health care interventions, and is now estimated to be 11.5 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Whitman-Walker Clinic). Individuals may well begin to live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer at each stage of the disease process. Thus, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural course of the disease changes, it will be important to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
track the changing needs for rehabilitation and community support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. Most ``Persons Living with AIDS'' (PLWA) aspire to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain as normal a life as possible during the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease and disability and have both the potential and the right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit from appropriate service programs. It is extremely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical that culturally sensitive, community integrated service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems to promote rehabilitation, independence, employment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community integration and to reduce barriers be developed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and section 504 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, define an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a disability as one who ``has a physical or mental impairment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that substantially limits his or her ability to perform one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more major life activities, has a record of an impairment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially limits a major life activity, and/or is regarded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an employer or other covered entity as having an impairment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially limits a major life activity.'' This definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes people with HIV/AIDS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals with HIV/AIDS may be entitled to income transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments and medical assistance benefits; they also may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible, depending on specific criteria in the various statutes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for services under a number of public service programs, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational rehabilitation and independent living, mental health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and drug abuse services, veterans' services, and housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are many allegations that the traditional social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service systems, including vocational rehabilitation, are ill-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped to respond to the need for services. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 National Survey of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) and AIDS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed to State VR agencies by the American Rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (ARA), concludes that there are numerous barriers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delivery of rehabilitative services to persons living with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HIV/AIDS. These barriers include the fears and anxieties of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vocational rehabilitation staff, public stigma associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HIV/AIDS, confidentiality issues, lack of knowledge about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation needs of persons with HIV/AIDS, and the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more extensive services than those currently available through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vocational rehabilitation system. Factors in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural course of the disease, including remissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exacerbations, compounding, rates of decline, and many other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics that are not well understood in terms of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to disability and to support services may affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitability of existing service models to meet the needs of PLWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there is some indication that the patterns of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease, and the associated service needs, are different for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minority individuals, who are likely to enter the health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service system later in the illness, and for women, for whom not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only the support needs but also the natural course of the disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear to differ (Campbell, et al., 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many rehabilitation experts hypothesize that the approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and techniques that have been developed to address issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding other types of disability are relevant to, and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective in, addressing issues regarding HIV/AIDS. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches include secondary prevention, vocational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation, job accommodations, barrier removal, peer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support, independent living, personal assistance services, public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education, integrated model service systems, job sharing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the most effective application of disability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitative approaches to HIV/AIDS is dependent upon first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing knowledge about the pattern(s) of disabling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences typically associated with the disease process; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional capacities associated with various stages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease process; and the duration and intensity of various types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of supports needed for this population at different stages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease process. Any research designed to address these issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must ensure that findings can be applied cross-gender and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culturally diverse populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any project to be funded under this priority is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be familiar with, and to coordinate and cooperate with, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant AIDS research activities of the Centers for Disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
